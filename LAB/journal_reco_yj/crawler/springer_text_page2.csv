abstract,"Abstract Network operators and mobile carriers are facing serious security challenges caused by an increasing number of services provided by smartphone Apps. For example, Android OS has more than 1 million Apps in stores. Hence, network administrators tend to adopt strict policies to secure their infrastructure. The aim of this study is to propose an efficient framework that has a classification component based on traffic analysis of Android Apps. The framework differs from other proposed studies by focusing on identifying Apps traffic from a network perspective without introducing any overhead on subscribers smartphones. Additionally, it involves a technique for pre-processing network flows generated by Apps to acquire a set of features that are used to build an identification model using machine learning algorithms. The classification model is built using classification ensembles. A group of chosen users contribute in training the classification model, which learns the normal behavior of selected Apps. Eventually, the model should be able to detect abnormal behavior of similar Apps across the network. A 93.78% classification accuracy is achieved with a low false positive rate under 0.5%. In addition, the framework is able to detect abnormal flows of unknown classes by implementing an outlier detection mechanism and reported a 94% accuracy."

abstract,"Abstract Online product reviews nowadays are increasingly prevalent in E-commerce websites. People often refer to product reviews to evaluate the quality of a product before purchasing. However, there have been a large number of review spammers who often work collaboratively to promote or demote target products, which severely harm the review system. Much previous work exploits machine learning approaches to detect suspicious reviews/reviewers. In this paper, we introduce a top-down computing framework, namely GGSpam, to detect review spammer groups by exploiting the topological structure of the underlying reviewer graph which reveals the co-review collusiveness. A novel instantiation of GGSpam, namely GSBC, is designed by modeling spammer groups as bi-connected graphs. Given a reviewer graph, GSBC identifies all the bi-connected components whose spamicity scores exceed the given spam threshold. For large unsuspicious bi-connected graphs, the minimum cut algorithm is used to split the graph, and the smaller graphs are further processed recursively. A variety of group spam indicators are designed to measure the spamicity of a spammer group. Experimental study shows that the proposed approach is both effective and efficient and outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including graph based and non-graph based, by a large margin."

abstract,"Abstract Motivated by real applications, heterogeneous learning has emerged as an important research area, which aims to model the coexistence of multiple types of heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous representation learning model with structured sparsity regularization (HERES) to learn from multiple types of heterogeneity. It aims to leverage the rich correlations (e.g., task relatedness, view consistency, and label correlation) and the prior knowledge (e.g., the soft-clustering of tasks) of heterogeneous data to improve learning performance. To this end, HERES integrates multi-task, multi-view, and multi-label learning into a principled framework based on representation learning to model the complex correlations and employs the structured sparsity to encode the prior knowledge of data. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the reconstruction loss of using the factor matrices to recover the heterogeneous data, and the structured sparsity imposed on the model. The resulting optimization problem is challenging due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of structured sparsity. We reformulate the problem by using the auxiliary function and prove that the reformulation is separable, which leads to an efficient algorithm family for solving structured sparsity penalized problems. Furthermore, we propose various HERES models based on different loss functions and subsume them into the weighted HERES, which is able to handle missing data. The experimental results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

abstract,"Abstract Land cover change (LCC) models aim to track spatiotemporal changes made in land cover. In most cases, LCC models contain uncertainties in their main components (i.e., input parameters and model structure). These uncertainties propagate through the modeling system, which generates uncertainties in the model outputs. The aim of this manuscript is to propose an approach to reduce uncertainty of LCC prediction models. The main objective of the proposed approach is to apply a sensitivity analysis method, based on belief function theory, to determine parameters and structures that have a high contribution in the variability of the predictions of the LCC model. Our approach is applied to four common LCC models (i.e., DINAMICA, SLEUTH, CA-MARKOV, and LCM). Results  show that uncertainty of the model parameters and structure has meaningful impacts on the final decisions of LCC models. Ignoring this uncertainty can lead to erroneous decision about land changes. Therefore, the presented approach is very useful to identify the most relevant uncertainty sources that need to be processed to improve the accuracy of LCC models. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a case study based on the Cairo region. Results  show that 13% of the agriculture and 3.8% of the desert lands in 2014 would be converted to urban areas in 2025."

abstract,"Abstract With the growing explosion of online social networks, the study of large-scale graph clustering has attracted considerable interest. Most of traditional methods view the graph clustering problem as an optimization problem based on a given objective function; however, there are few methodical theories for the emergence of clusters over real-life networks. In this paper, each actor in online social networks is viewed as a selfish player in a non-cooperative game. The strategy associated with each node is defined as the cluster membership vector, and each one’s incentive is to maximize its own social identity by adopting the most suitable strategy. The definition of utility function in our game model is inspired by the conformity psychology, which is defined as the weighted average of one’s social identity by participating different clusters. With this setting, the proposed game can well match a potential game. So that the cluster could be shaped by the actions of those closely interactive users who adopt the same strategy in a Nash equilibrium. To this end, we propose a novel Graph cLustering framework based on potEntial gAme optiMization (GLEAM) for parallel graph clustering. It first utilize the cosine similarity to weight each edge in the original network. Then, an initial partition, including a number of clusters dominated by those potential “leader nodes”, is created by a fast heuristic process. Third, a potential game-based weighted Modularity optimization is used to improve the initial partition. Finally, we introduce the notion of potentially attractive cluster, and then discover the overlapping partition of the graph using a simple double-threshold procedure. Three phases in GLEAM are carefully designed for parallel execution. Experiments on real-world networks analyze the convergence inside GLEAM, and demonstrate the high performance of GLEAM by comparing it with the state-of-the-art community detection approaches in the literature."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper we describe a novel framework for the discovery of the topical content of a data corpus, and the tracking of its complex structural changes across the temporal dimension. In contrast to previous work our model does not impose a prior on the rate at which documents are added to the corpus nor does it adopt the Markovian assumption which overly restricts the type of changes that the model can capture. Our key technical contribution is a framework based on (i) discretization of time into epochs, (ii) epoch-wise topic discovery using a hierarchical Dirichlet process-based model, and (iii) a temporal similarity graph which allows for the modelling of complex topic changes: emergence and disappearance, evolution, splitting, and merging. The power of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two medical literature corpora concerned with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS)—both increasingly important research subjects with significant social and healthcare consequences. In addition to the collected ASD and metabolic syndrome literature corpora which we made freely available, our contribution also includes an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed framework. We describe a detailed and careful examination of the effects that our algorithms’s free parameters have on its output and discuss the significance of the findings both in the context of the practical application of our algorithm as well as in the context of the existing body of work on temporal topic analysis. Our quantitative analysis is followed by several qualitative case studies highly relevant to the current research on ASD and MetS, on which our algorithm is shown to capture well the actual developments in these fields."

abstract,"Abstract In this work, a novel approach utilizing feature covariance matrices is proposed for time series classification. In order to adapt the feature covariance matrices into time series classification problem, a feature vector is defined for each point in a time series. The feature vector comprises local and global information such as value, derivative, rank, deviation from the mean, the time index of the point and cumulative sum up to the point. Extracted feature vectors for the time instances are concatenated to construct feature matrices for the overlapping subsequences. Covariances of the feature matrices are used to describe the subsequences. Our main purpose in this work is to introduce and evaluate the feature covariance representation for time series classification. Therefore, in classification stage, firstly, 1-NN classifier is utilized. After showing the effectiveness of the representation with 1-NN classifier, the experiments are repeated with SVM classifier. The other novelty in this work is that a novel distance measure is introduced for time series by feature covariance matrix representation. Conducted experiments on UCR time series datasets show that the proposed method mostly outperforms the well-known methods such as DTW, shapelet transform and other state-of-the-art techniques."

abstract,"Abstract Supporting and representing the group decision-making process is a complex task that requires very specific aspects. The current existing argumentation models cannot make good use of all the advantages inherent to group decision-making. There is no monitoring of the process or the possibility to provide dynamism to it. These issues can compromise the success of group decision support systems if those systems are not able to provide freedom and all necessary mechanisms to the decision-maker. We investigate the use of argumentation in a completely new perspective that will allow for a mutual understanding between agents and decision-makers. Besides this, our proposal allows to define an agent not only according to the preferences of the decision-maker but also according to his interests towards the decision-making process. We show that our definition respects the requirements that are essential for groups to interact without limitations and that can take advantage of those interactions to create valuable knowledge to support more and better."

abstract,"Abstract The Semantic Web contains an enormous amount of information in the form of knowledge bases (KB). To make this information available, many question answering (QA) systems over KBs were created in the last years. Building a QA system over KBs is difficult because there are many different challenges to be solved. In order to address these challenges, QA systems generally combine techniques from natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning and Semantic Web. The aim of this survey is to give an overview of the techniques used in current QA systems over KBs. We present the techniques used by the QA systems which were evaluated on a popular series of benchmarks: Question Answering over Linked Data. Techniques that solve the same task are first grouped together and then described. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed for each technique. This allows a direct comparison of similar techniques. Additionally, we point to techniques that are used over WebQuestions and SimpleQuestions, which are two other popular benchmarks for QA systems."

It provides means of adaptation to changes by removing effects of obsolete (not necessarily old) information from models. This also applies to intelligent systems, such as recommender systems, which learn users’ preferences and predict future items of interest. In this work, we present unsupervised forgetting techniques that make recommender systems adapt to changes of users’ preferences over time. We propose eleven techniques that select obsolete information and three algorithms that enforce the forgetting in different ways. In our evaluation on real-world datasets, we show that forgetting obsolete information significantly improves predictive power of recommender systems."

abstract,"Abstract To automatically extract data records from Web pages, the data record extraction algorithm is required to be robust and efficient. However, most of existing algorithms are not robust enough to cope with rich information or noisy data. In this paper, we propose a novel suffix tree-based extraction method (STEM) for this challenging task. First, we extract a sequence of identifiers from the tag paths of Web pages. Then, a suffix tree is built on top of this sequence and four refining filters are proposed to screen out data regions that might not contain data records. To evaluate model performance, we define an evaluation metric called pattern similarity and perform rigorous experiments on five real data sets. The promising experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed STEM is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms like MDR, TPC and CTVS with respect to precision, recall and pattern similarity. Moreover, the time complexity of STEM is linear to the total number of HTML tags contained in Web pages, which indicates the potential applicability of STEM in a wide range of Web-scale data record extraction applications."

abstract,"Abstract This paper develops a Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) mathematical programming method to solve multi-attribute group decision-making problems under PF environments. The main work is summarized as four aspects: (1) Considering the fuzziness and hesitancy in pairwise comparisons of alternatives, we firstly introduce PF sets to depict the fuzzy truth degrees of alternative comparisons. (2) According to the information entropy, individual subjective attribute weight vectors of decision makers (DMs) are calculated and integrated into a collective one by a cross-entropy optimization model. Then DMs’ weights are objectively derived from the collective subjective attribute weight vector. (3) PF group consistency and inconsistency indices are defined based on PF-positive ideal solution (PFPIS) and PF-negative ideal solution (PFNIS), respectively. To determine comprehensive attribute weights, a biobjective PF mathematical programming model is constructed through minimizing two inconsistency indices based on PFPIS and PFNIS simultaneously. A linear programming method is technically developed to solve this model. (4) Using the cross-entropy again, collective relative closeness degrees of alternatives are explicitly derived to rank the alternatives. Finally, an example of green supplier selection is analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this paper, we focus on a variant of robust frequent itemsets in which a small amount of “faults” is allowed in each item and each supporting transaction. This problem is challenging since computing fault-tolerant support count is NP-hard and the anti-monotone property does not hold when the amount of allowable faults is proportional to the size of the itemset. We develop heuristic methods to solve an approximation version of the problem and propose speedup techniques for the exact problem. Experimental results show that our heuristic algorithms are substantially faster than the state-of-the-art exact algorithms while the error is acceptable. In addition, the proposed speedup techniques substantially improve the efficiency of the exact algorithms."

Self-labeled techniques stand out from semi-supervised classification methods due to their simplicity and the lack of strong assumptions about the distribution of the labeled and unlabeled data. This paper addresses the relevance of these techniques in the time series classification context by means of an empirical study that compares successful self-labeled methods in conjunction with various learning schemes and dissimilarity measures. Our experiments involve 35 time series datasets with different ratios of labeled data, aiming to measure the transductive and inductive classification capabilities of the self-labeled methods studied. The results show that the nearest-neighbor rule is a robust choice for the base classifier. In addition, the amending and multi-classifier self-labeled-based approaches reveal a promising attempt to perform semi-supervised classification in the time series context."

Previous PSP studies construct prediction models mainly on data collected from questionnaires or some specific learning systems. Instead, students’ Internet access logs were used in this study to predict high-risk students. Since the raw data in log files are high-dimensional, complex and full of noise, several methods were proposed for the preprocessing of the data source. A high-dimensional feature selection framework is then designed to prepare features for the construction of a prediction model with good trade-off between computational efficiency and prediction performance. Experiments showed that the proposed prediction model can identify about 85% of high-risk students. Some online characteristics of high-risk students were also discovered, which might help student counselors and educational researchers better understand the relationship between students’ Internet use and their academic performance."

abstract,"Abstract In this work, we focus on online review systems, in which users provide opinions about a set of entities (movies, restaurants, etc.) based on their experiences and in turn can check what others prefer. These systems have been proved to be sensitive to fraud and have shown some shortcomings as a result of capturing opinions through numerical ratings. Thus, supported by recent work on the field, we tackle the problem of fraud in such systems by designing a mechanism based on pairwise comparisons, coupled with an incentive policy attempting to foster the collection of majority opinions over individual experiences. As a result, we propose a new mechanism called iPWRM (incentive-based PWRM), where users are persuaded to reply honestly to pairwise queries based on opinion polls. The idea is: (1) to give a positive reward when all users agree in their reviews; (2) to give a positive reward when a user agrees the majority’s choice; and finally, (3) to give a low incentive—possibly null—when user’s review does not match the majority. Therefore, it is able (1) to overcome the bias introduced into reputation rankings by fraud reviews in ORSs, as well as (2) to mitigate potential biased problems derived from the use of numerical ratings. We exhaustively test the performance of the mechanism by using two different well-known existing datasets Flixster and HetRec2011—real world datasets on movie reviews, aiming to test the performance of the mechanism as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of iPWRM when fraud comes into play."

To achieve this objective, the basic idea is to discard a large part of the points of S, in such a way that the problem can be solved providing only the remaining points to a classical computational geometry algorithm that, by processing a smaller collection of points, saves main memory resources and computation time. The correctness of our algorithm is formally proven. In addition, we empirically show its efficiency and scalability by running a set of experiments using both synthetic and real data."

abstract,"Abstract The shortest path between two concepts in a taxonomic ontology is commonly used to represent the semantic distance between concepts in edge-based semantic similarity measures. In the past, edge counting, which is simple and intuitive and has low computational complexity, was considered the default method for path computation. However, a large lexical taxonomy, such as WordNet, has irregular link densities between concepts due to its broad domain, but edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this non-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation can be separated from edge-based similarity measures and can form various general computing models. Therefore, to solve the problem of the non-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a new path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of concepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers for concepts in the shortest path. This path model considers the local area density of concepts as an extension of the edge counting-based path according to the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and can be applied in various edge-based similarity approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed path model improves the average optimal correlation between edge-based measures and human judgments on the Miller and Charles benchmark for WordNet from less than 0.79 to more than 0.86, on the Pedersenet al. benchmark (average of both Physician and Coder) for SNOMED-CT from less than 0.75 to more than 0.82, and it has a large advantage in efficiency compared with information content computation in a dynamic ontology, thereby successfully improving the edge-based similarity measure as an excellent method with high performance and high efficiency."

abstract,"Abstract Based on the simulated annealing strategy and immunodominance in the artificial immune system, a simulated annealing-based immunodominance algorithm (SAIA) for multi-objective optimization (MOO) is proposed in this paper. In SAIA, all immunodominant antibodies are divided into two classes: the active antibodies and the hibernate antibodies at each temperature. Clonal proliferation and recombination are employed to enhance local search on those active antibodies while the hibernate antibodies have no function, but they could become active during the following temperature. Thus, all antibodies in the search space can be exploited effectively and sufficiently. Simulated annealing-based adaptive hypermutation, population pruning, and simulated annealing selection are proposed in SAIA to evolve and obtain a set of antibodies as the trade-off solutions. Complexity analysis of SAIA is also provided. The performance comparison of SAIA with some state-of-the-art MOO algorithms in solving 14 well-known multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) including four many objectives test problems and twelve multi-objective 0/1 knapsack problems shows that SAIA is superior in converging to approximate Pareto front with a standout distribution."

abstract,"Abstract Sentiment analysis is a challenging task that attracted increasing interest during the last years. The availability of online data along with the business interest to keep up with consumer feedback generates a constant demand for online analysis of user-generated content. A key role to this task plays the utilization of domain-specific lexicons of opinion words that enables algorithms to classify short snippets of text into sentiment classes (positive, negative). This process is known as dictionary-based sentiment analysis. The related work tends to solve this lexicon identification problem by either exploiting a corpus and a thesaurus or by manually defining a set of patterns that will extract opinion words. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for discovering patterns that will extract domain-specific dictionary. Our approach (DidaxTo) utilizes opinion modifiers, sentiment consistency theories, polarity assignment graphs and pattern similarity metrics. The outcome is compared against lexicons extracted by the state-of-the-art approaches on a sentiment analysis task. Experiments on user reviews coming from a diverse set of products demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. An implementation of the proposed approach in an easy to use application for extracting opinion words from any domain and evaluate their quality is also presented."

abstract,"Abstract Classifying a stream of non-stationary data with recurrent drift is a challenging task and has been considered as an interesting problem in recent years. All of the existing approaches handling recurrent concepts maintain a pool of concepts/classifiers and use that pool for future classifications to reduce the error on classifying the instances from a recurring concept. However, the number of classifiers in the pool usually grows very fast as the accurate detection of an underlying concept is a challenging task in itself. Thus, there may be many concepts in the pool representing the same underlying concept. This paper proposes the GraphPool framework that refines the pool of concepts by applying a merging mechanism whenever necessary: after receiving a new batch of data, we extract a concept representation from the current batch considering the correlation among features. Then, we compare the current batch representation to the concept representations in the pool using a statistical multivariate likelihood test. If more than one concept is similar to the current batch, all the corresponding concepts will be merged. GraphPool not only keeps the concepts but also maintains the transition among concepts via a first-order Markov chain. The current state is maintained at all times and new instances are predicted based on that. Keeping these transitions helps to quickly recover from drifts in some real-world problems with periodic behavior. Comprehensive experimental results of the framework on synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of the framework in terms of performance and pool management."

abstract,"Abstract Instance matching is the problem of determining whether two instances describe the same real-world entity or not. Instance matching plays a key role in data integration and data cleansing, especially for building a knowledge base. For example, we can regard each article in encyclopedias as an instance, and a group of articles which refers to the same real-world object as an entity. Therefore, articles about Washington should be distinguished and grouped into different entities such as Washington, D.C (the capital of the USA), George Washington (first president of the USA), Washington (a state of the USA), Washington (a village in West Sussex, England), Washington F.C. (a football club based in Washington, Tyne and Wear, England), Washington, D.C. (a novel). In this paper, we proposed a novel instance matching approach Active Instance Matching with Pairwise Constraints, which can bring the human into the loop of instance matching. The proposed approach can generate candidate pairs in advance to reduce the computational complexity, and then iteratively select the most informative pairs according to the uncertainty, influence, connectivity and diversity of pairs. We evaluated our approach one two publicly available datasets AMINER and WIDE-NUS and then applied our approach to the two large-scale real-world datasets, Baidu Baike and Hudong Baike, to build a Chinese knowledge base. The experiments and practice illustrate the effectiveness of our approach."

abstract,"Abstract Support vector machine (SVM) is a state-of-art classification tool with good accuracy due to its ability to generate nonlinear model. However, the nonlinear models generated are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. This lack of explanatory ability is a serious problem for practical SVM applications which require comprehensibility. Therefore, this study applies a C5 decision tree (DT) to extract rules from SVM result. In addition, a metaheuristic algorithm is employed for the feature selection. Both SVM and C5 DT require expensive computation. Applying these two algorithms simultaneously for high-dimensional data will increase the computational cost. This study applies artificial bee colony optimization (ABC) algorithm to select the important features. The proposed algorithm ABC–SVM–DT is applied to extract comprehensible rules from SVMs. The ABC algorithm is applied to implement feature selection and parameter optimization before SVM–DT. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using eight datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The result shows that the classification accuracy and complexity of the final decision tree can be improved simultaneously by the proposed ABC–SVM–DT algorithm, compared with genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm."

abstract,"Abstract Logic-based models have been already proposed for information retrieval purpose. However, there is a need for new formalisms providing more generic frameworks. For this purpose, an information retrieval axiomatic theory is proposed in this paper, independently of any model. Our proposal which mainly relies on many-sorted logic allows to consider various sets in the domain of discourse that provides us a rich framework to model the different items such as documents, index terms, queries. The theory relies on a sound set of axioms driving the retrieval process as proof of theorems. As such the genericity consists of a main motivation; it will be proved that three classical information retrieval models, namely the Boolean model; the fuzzy-set-based extension of the Boolean model; and the vector space model, satisfy the proposed theory, establishing then its consistency. Beyond the genericity, the proposed approach may face concrete problems. Indeed, it is well known that the use of the classical settings of formal concept analysis theory for information retrieval does not allow disjunctions and negations in queries. For this purpose, this paper gives a characterization of these queries forms using appropriates theorems of the theory. Useful algebraic properties (i.e., isomorphisms) are then established for this end."

abstract,"Abstract Human mobility patterns reflect many aspects of life, from the global spread of infectious diseases to urban planning and daily commute patterns. In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we survey and assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics. Finally, we analyze the short-term trends and future challenges of human mobility analysis."

abstract,"Abstract Social web and social media are evidenced to be a rich source of user-generated social content. Social media includes multiple numbers of social dimensions represented by different social networks. The identification of important player in these real-world social networks has been in high emphasis due to its effectiveness in multiple disciplines, especially in law enforcement areas working on dark networks. Many algorithms have been proposed to identify key players according to the objective of interest using suitable network centrality measures. This paper proposes a new perspective of dealing with key player identification by redefining it as a problem of “Key Individual Identification,” across multiple social dimensions. Research deals with each social dimension as a layer in the multiple-layer social network model. The proposed technique extracts a number of features from each network based on social network analysis. The features are assembled to formulate a global feature set representing the behaviors of individuals in all networks individually. The technique then attempts to find key individuals using hybrid classifiers. The results from all classifiers are formulated, and the final decision of an individual to be part of the individual key set is based on majority voting. This novel technique gives good results on a number of known networks."

abstract,"Abstract In software development, non-functional requirements (NFRs) play a crucial role in decision-making procedures for architectural solutions. A strong relation exists between NFRs and design patterns, a powerful method to support the architectural design of software systems, but due to their complexity and abstraction, NFRs are rarely taken into account in software design. In fact, the knowledge on NFRs is usually owned by designers and not formalized in a structured way. We propose to structure the knowledge associated with NFRs via a Fuzzy Ontology, which we show is able to model their mutual relations and interactions. The declarative approach makes possible to represent and maintain the above-mentioned knowledge by keeping the flexibility and fuzziness of modeling thanks to the use of fuzzy concepts such as high, low, fair. We present a decision support system based on (i) a fuzzy OWL 2 ontology that encodes 109 design patterns, 28 pattern families and 37 NFRs and their mutual relations, (ii) a novel reasoning service to retrieve a ranked list of pattern sets able to satisfy the non-functional requirements within a system specification."

abstract,"Abstract Process-aware information systems (PAISs) are increasingly used to provide flexible support for business processes. The support given through a PAIS is greatly enhanced when it is able to provide accurate time predictions which is typically a very challenging task. Predictions should be (1) multi-dimensional and (2) not based on a single process instance. Furthermore, the prediction system should be able to (3) adapt to changing circumstances and (4) deal with multi-perspective declarative languages (e.g., models which consider time, resource, data and control flow perspectives). In this work, a novel approach for generating time predictions considering the aforementioned characteristics is proposed. For this, first, a multi-perspective constraint-based language is used to model the scenario. Thereafter, an optimized enactment plan (representing a potential execution alternative) is generated from such a model considering the current execution state of the process instances. Finally, predictions are performed by evaluating a desired function over this enactment plan. To evaluate the applicability of our approach in practical settings we apply it to a real process scenario. Despite the high complexity of the considered problems, results indicate that our approach produces a satisfactory number of good predictions in a reasonable time."

abstract,"Abstract Heart is one of the essential operating organs of the human body and its failure is a major contributing factor toward the human deaths. Coronary heart disease may be asymptotic but can be anticipated through the medical tests and daily life routine of the subject. Diagnosis of the coronary heart disease needs a specialized medical resource with the plenty of experience. All over the world and particularly in the developing countries, there is a lack of such experts which make the diagnosis more difficult. In this paper, we present a clinical heart disease diagnostic system by proposing feature subset selection methodology with an object of achieving improved performance. The proposed methodology presents three algorithms for selecting candidate feature subsets: (1) mean Fisher score-based feature selection algorithm, (2) forward feature selection algorithm and (3) reverse feature selection algorithm. Feature subset selection algorithm is presented to select the most decisive subset from the candidate feature subsets. The features are added to the feature subsets on the basis of their individual Fisher scores, while the selection of a feature subset depends on its Matthews correlation coefficient score and dimension. The selected feature subset with the reduced dimension is fed to the RBF kernel-based SVM which results in binary classification: (1) heart disease patient and (2) normal control subject. The proposed methodology is validated through accuracy, specificity and sensitivity using four UCI datasets, i.e., Cleveland, Switzerland, Hungarian and SPECTF. The statistical results achieved using the proposed technique are shown in comparison with the existing techniques reflecting its better performance. It has an accuracy of 81.19, 84.52, 92.68 and 82.7% for Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland and SPECTF, respectively."

abstract,"Abstract Ensemble pruning is effective for improving the accuracy of expression recognition. This paper proposes a novel ensemble pruning algorithm called RTCRelief-F and applies it to facial expression recognition. RTCRelief-F uses a novel classifier-representation method that accounts for the interaction among classifiers and bases the classifier selection upon not only diversity but accuracy. Additionally, for the first time, RTCRelief-F, applies the Relief-F algorithm to evaluate the classifiers’ ability and resets the fusion order. Finally, the combination of a clustering-based ensemble pruning method and the ordering-based ensemble pruning method can both alleviate the dependence of a selected subset S on the adopted clustering strategies and guarantee the diversity of the selected subset S. The experimental results show that this method outperforms or competes with the original ensemble and some major state-of-the-art results on the data sets Fer2013, JAFFE, and CK\(+\)."

abstract,"Abstract Accuracy of the k-nearest neighbour (\(k\hbox {NN}\)) classifier depends strongly on the ability of the used distance to induce k-nearest neighbours of the same class while keeping distant samples of different classes. For time series classification, \(k\hbox {NN}\) based on dynamic time warping (dtw) measure remains among the most popular and competitive approaches. However, by assuming time series uniformly distributed, standard dtw may show some limitations to classify complex time series. In this paper, we show how to enhance the potential of \(k\hbox {NN}\) under time warp measure by learning a locally weighted dynamic time warping. For that, first discriminative features are learned from the neighbourhoods, then used to weight time series elements to bring closer the k-nearest neighbours of the same class and move away the k-nearest neighbours of different classes. To evaluate the proposed method, a deep analysis and experimentation are conducted on 87 public datasets from different application domains, varying sizes and difficulty levels. The results obtained show significant improvement in the proposed weighted dtw for time series \(k\hbox {NN}\) classification."

Unlike the existing density-based subspace clustering algorithms which find clusters using spatial proximity, existence of common high-density regions is the condition for grouping of features here. The proposed method is capable of finding subspace clusters based on both linear and nonlinear relationships between features. Unlike existing density-based subspace clustering algorithms, the values of parameters for density estimation need not be provided by the user. These values are calculated for each pair of features using data distribution in space corresponding to the particular pair of features. This allows proposed approach to find subspace clusters where relationship between different features exists at different scales. The performance of proposed algorithm is compared with other subspace clustering methods using artificial and real-life datasets. The proposed method is seen to find subspace clusters embedded in 5 artificial datasets with greater G score. It is also seen that the proposed method is able to find subspace clusters corresponding to known classes in 4 real-life datasets, with greater accuracy."

abstract,"Abstract Forecasting air-pollutant levels is an important issue, due to their adverse effects on public health, and often a legislative necessity. The advantage of Bayesian methods is their ability to provide density predictions which can easily be transformed into ordinal or binary predictions given a set of thresholds. We develop a Bayesian approach to forecasting PM\(_{10}\) and O\(_3\) levels that efficiently deals with extensive amounts of input parameters, and test whether it outperforms classical models and experts. The new approach is used to fit models for PM\(_{10}\) and O\(_3\) level forecasting that can be used in daily practice. We also introduce a novel approach for comparing models to experts based on estimated cost matrices. The results for diverse air quality monitoring sites across Slovenia show that Bayesian models outperform classical models in both PM\(_{10}\) and O\(_3\) predictions. The proposed models perform better than experts in PM\(_{10}\) and are on par with experts in O\(_3\) predictions—where experts already base their predictions on predictions from a statistical model. A Bayesian approach—especially using Gaussian processes—offers several advantages: superior performance, robustness to overfitting, more information, and the ability to efficiently adapt to different cost matrices."

abstract,"Abstract Despite recent effort to estimate topology characteristics of large graphs (e.g., online social networks and peer-to-peer networks), little attention has been given to develop a formal crawling methodology to characterize the vast amount of content distributed over these networks. Due to the large-scale nature of these networks and a limited query rate imposed by network service providers, exhaustively crawling and enumerating content maintained by each vertex is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we show how one can obtain content properties by crawling only a small fraction of vertices and collecting their content. We first show that when sampling is naively applied, this can produce a huge bias in content statistics (i.e., average number of content replicas). To remove this bias, one may use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate content characteristics. However, our experimental results show that this straightforward method requires to sample most vertices to obtain accurate estimates. To address this challenge, we propose two efficient estimators: special copy estimator (SCE) and weighted copy estimator (WCE) to estimate content characteristics using available information in sampled content. SCE uses the special content copy indicator to compute the estimate, while WCE derives the estimate based on meta-information in sampled vertices. We conduct experiments on a variety of real-word and synthetic datasets, and the results show that WCE and SCE are cost effective and also “asymptotically unbiased”. Our methodology provides a new tool for researchers to efficiently query content distributed in large-scale networks."

abstract,"Abstract There has been continuous research in the energy distribution sector because of its huge impact on modern societies. Nonetheless, aerial high voltage power lines are still supported by old transmission towers which involve some serious risks. Those risks may be avoided with periodic and expensive reviews. The main objective of this work is to reduce the number of these periodic reviews so that the maintenance cost of power lines is also reduced. More specifically, the work is focused on reducing the number of periodic reviews of transmission towers to avoid step and touch potentials, which are very dangerous for humans. A virtual organization-based multi-agent system is proposed in conjunction with different artificial intelligence methods and algorithms. The developed system is able to propose a sample of transmission towers from a selected set to be reviewed. The system ensures that the whole set will have similar values without needing to review all the transmission towers. As a result of this work, a website application is provided to manage all the review processes and all the transmission towers of Spain. It allows the companies that review the transmission towers to initiate a new review process for a whole line or area, while the system indicates the transmission towers to review. The system is also able to recommend the best place to locate a new transmission tower or the best type of structure to use when a new transmission tower must be used."

abstract,"Abstract How do the k-core structures of real-world graphs look like? What are the common patterns and the anomalies? How can we exploit them for applications? A k-core is the maximal subgraph in which all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from diverse domains. Our discoveries are: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated with degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists) obeys a 3-to-1 power-law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy–cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core–periphery and communities. Our algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns. (1) Core-A, which measures the deviation from Mirror Pattern, successfully spots anomalies in real-world graphs, (2) Core-D, a single-pass streaming algorithm based on Core-Triangle Pattern, accurately estimates degeneracy up to 12 \(\times \) faster than its competitor. (3) Core-S, inspired by Structured Core Pattern, identifies influential spreaders up to 17 \(\times \) faster than its competitors with comparable accuracy."

This decision is simply taken by looking at the working behaviors of the other agents, comparing the respective levels of well-being and imitating the more advantageous decision of others. The analysis reveals that such mechanism of social learning and imitation suffices to replicate the existing empirical evidence regarding the decline in labor market participation of older people. As a consequence, the paper demonstrates that it is not necessary to assume perfect and unrealistic rationality at the individual level to reproduce a rational behavior in the aggregate."

The promising viral marketing paradigm on social network is different from the current research in two main aspects. First, instead of maximizing the message spread over the entire social network, we focus on the target market since the business vendors almost specify the group of target users before designing its marketing strategy. Second, the status of a user is no longer a binary indicator representing either active or inactive. In the new model, the user status turns to be an integer value reflecting the amount of influences delivered to that user. In this paper, we prove the NP-hard nature of this challenging problem. We further present several strategies, including an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the simulated annealing optimization concept and a greedy algorithm as the baseline, to select the initial k seeds in pursuit of resulting quality close to the optimal one. As demonstrated in the empirical study on real data, instead of only providing the flexibility of striking a compromise between the execution efficiency and the resulting quality, our proposed heuristic algorithm can achieve high efficiency and meanwhile can obtain the target acceptance frequency even better than the greedy result in some cases, demonstrating its prominent feasibility to resolve the challenging problem efficiently."

abstract,"Abstract MapReduce is a design pattern for processing large datasets distributed on a cluster. Its performances are linked to the data structure and the runtime environment. Indeed, data skew can yield an unfair task allocation, but even when the initial allocation produced by the partition function is well balanced, an unfair allocation can occur during the reduce phase due to the heterogeneous performance of nodes. For these reasons, we propose an adaptive multi-agent system. In our approach, the reducer agents interact during the job and the task reallocation is based on negotiation in order to decrease the workload of the most loaded reducer and so the runtime. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two negotiation strategies. Finally, we experiment our multi-agent system with real-world datasets over heterogeneous runtime environment."

abstract,"Abstract The twenty-first century organizations are characterized by an emphasis on knowledge and information. Today’s organizations also require the acquisition, management, and exploitation of knowledge and information in order to improve their own performance. In the current economy, the foundations of organizational competitiveness have turned former tangible and intangible resources into knowledge and the focus of information systems has also changed from information management to knowledge management. Besides, the most important step in the implementation of knowledge management is to examine the significant factors in this regard and to identify the causes of failure. Therefore, the present study evaluated knowledge management failure factors in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment as a case study in Khuzestan Oil and Gas Company. For this purpose, a series of failure factors affecting knowledge management in organizations were identified based on a review of the related literature and similar studies. Then, 16 failure factors in the implementation of knowledge management in the given organization were determined on the basis of interviews with company experts. According to the specified factors as well as the integration of multiple criteria decision-making techniques in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, knowledge management failure factors in Khuzestan Oil and Gas Company were investigated. The results indicated that lack of management commitment and leadership was the most important factor affecting the failure of knowledge management in the given company."

abstract,"Abstract Detecting topics from Twitter streams has become an important task as it is used in various fields including natural disaster warning, users opinion assessment, and traffic prediction. In this article, we outline different types of topic detection techniques and evaluate their performance. We categorize the topic detection techniques into five categories which are clustering, frequent pattern mining, Exemplar-based, matrix factorization, and probabilistic models. For clustering techniques, we discuss and evaluate nine different techniques which are sequential k-means, spherical k-means, Kernel k-means, scalable Kernel k-means, incremental batch k-means, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, document pivot clustering, and Bngram. Moreover, for matrix factorization techniques, we analyze five different techniques which are sequential Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), stochastic LSI, Alternating Least Squares (ALS), Rank-one Downdate (R1D), and Column Subset Selection (CSS). Additionally, we evaluate several other techniques in the frequent pattern mining, Exemplar-based, and probabilistic model categories. Results  on three Twitter datasets show that Soft Frequent Pattern Mining (SFM) and Bngram achieve the best term precision, while CSS achieves the best term recall and topic recall in most of the cases. Moreover, Exemplar-based topic detection obtains a good balance between the term recall and term precision, while achieving a good topic recall and running time."

For this purpose, a novel semi-supervised wrappers induction algorithm has been developed and embedded in the BigGrams system. The wrappers induction algorithm utilizes a formal concept analysis to induce information extraction patterns. Also, in this article, the author (1) presents the impact of the configuration of the information extraction system components on information extraction results and (2) tests the boosting mode of this system. Based on empirical research, the author established that the proposed taxonomy of seeds and the HTML tags level analysis, with appropriate pre-processing, improve information extraction results. Also, the boosting mode works well when certain requirements are met, i.e. when well-diversified input data are ensured."

abstract,"Abstract Based on an argumentation theory approach, we present a novel method for evaluating complex goal-based activities by generalizing a notion of qualifier defined in the health domain. Three instances of the general qualifier are proposed: Performance, Actuation and Capacity; the first one evaluates what a person does, the second how an individual follows an action plan, and the third one how “well” or “bad” an activity is executed. Qualifiers are intended to be used by autonomous systems for evaluating human activity. We exemplify our approach using a health domain assessment protocol. Main results of this test show a partial correlation between ambiguities assessed by experts and our argument-based approach; and a multi-dimensional perspective how an activity is executed when a combined evaluation of qualifiers is used. This last outcome was interesting for some therapists consulted. Results  also show differences between values of qualifiers using different argumentation semantics; two scenarios were proposed by therapist for using different semantics: preliminary activity screening and time-span follow-up evaluation."

abstract,"Abstract Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to reduce the dimension of data by selecting a few orthonormal vectors that explain most of the variance structure of the data. \(L_1\) PCA uses the \(L_1\) norm to measure error, whereas the conventional PCA uses the \(L_2\) norm. For the \(L_1\) PCA problem minimizing the fitting error of the reconstructed data, we propose three algorithms based on iteratively reweighted least squares. We first develop an exact reweighted algorithm. Next, an approximate version is developed based on eigenpair approximation when the algorithm is near convergent. Finally, the approximate version is extended based on stochastic singular value decomposition. We provide convergence analyses, and compare their performance against benchmark algorithms in the literature. The computational experiment shows that the proposed algorithms consistently perform the best and the scalability is improved as we use eigenpair approximation and stochastic singular value decomposition."

abstract,"Abstract There has been an increasing interest in recent years in the mining of massive data sets whose sizes are measured in terabytes. However, there are some problems where collecting even a single data point is very expensive, resulting in data sets with only tens or hundreds of samples. One such problem is that of building code surrogates, where a computer simulation is run using many different values of the input parameters and a regression model is built to relate the outputs of the simulation to the inputs. A good surrogate can be very useful in sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and in designing experiments, but the cost of running expensive simulations at many sample points can be high. In this paper, we use a problem from the domain of additive manufacturing to show that even with small data sets we can build good quality surrogates by appropriately selecting the input samples and the regression algorithm. Our work is broadly applicable to simulations in other domains and the ideas proposed can be used in time-constrained machine learning tasks, such as hyper-parameter optimization."

abstract,"Abstract In agents that operate in environments where decision-making needs to take into account, not only the environment, but also the minimizing actions of an opponent (as in games), it is fundamental that the agent is endowed with the ability of progressively tracing the profile of its adversaries, in such a manner that this profile aids in the process of selecting appropriate actions. However, it would be unsuitable to construct an agent with a decision-making system based only on the elaboration of such a profile, as this would prevent the agent from having its “own identity,” which would leave the agent at the mercy of its opponent. Following this direction, this study proposes an automatic Checkers player, called ACE-RL-Checkers, equipped with a dynamic decision-making module, which adapts to the profile of the opponent over the course of the game. In such a system, the action selection process is conducted through a composition of multilayer perceptron neural network and case library. In this case, the neural network represents the “identity” of the agent, i.e., it is an already trained static decision-making module. On the other hand, the case library represents the dynamic decision-making module of the agent, which is generated by the Automatic Case Elicitation technique. This technique has a pseudo-random exploratory behavior, which allows the dynamic decision-making of the agent to be directed either by the opponent’s game profile or randomly. In order to avoid a high occurrence of pseudo-random decision-making in the game initial phases—in which the agent counts on very little information about its opponent—this work proposes a new module based on sequential pattern mining for generating a base of experience rules extracted from human expert’s game records. This module will improve the agent’s move selection in the game initial phases. Experiments carried out in tournaments involving ACE-RL-Checkers and other agents correlated to this work, confirm the superiority of the dynamic architecture proposed herein."

abstract,"Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a page clipping search engine based on page discussion topics. Compared to other search engines, our search engine uses the page discussion topic instead of the search engine results page as the main result. After the user selects the topic of interest, our search engine will clip the relevant pages according to the selected topic and produce an integrated page result. The advantage of this topic-based integration page result is that the user can reduce the time it takes to decide whether the page content is relevant. Our results consist of two parts: the query-related discussion topics and the clipping results for relevant pages. We first use an adjusted N-gram language model and a hash method to produce discussion topics. At the same time, we use the idea of binary coding and mathematical set to organize related topics into a hierarchical topic tree with parent–child relationship. Next, we use a cost-effective genetic algorithm to produce the relevant page clipping results. This study has the following three advantages. The first is that we can find multiple clustering relationships, that is, a child topic can appear simultaneously in multiple parent topics. The second is that we propose a good topic generation method, that is, we cannot only produce better quality topics, but also produce the topic tree in a linear time. The third is that we propose a good clipping generation method, that is, we cannot only produce better quality clippings, but also produce a cost-effective solution.

abstract,"Abstract In recent years, RESTful services that are mainly described using short texts are becoming increasingly popular. The keyword-based discovery technology adopted by existing service registries usually suffers from low recall and is insufficient to retrieve accurate RESTful services according to users’ functional goals. Moreover, it is often difficult for users to specify queries that can precisely represent their requirements due to the lack of knowledge on their desired service functionalities. Toward these issues, we propose a RESTful service discovery approach by leveraging service goal (i.e., service functionality) knowledge mined from services’ textual descriptions. The approach first groups the available services into clusters using probabilistic topic models. Then, service goals are extracted from the textual descriptions of services and also clustered based on the topic modeling results of services. Based on service goal clusters, we design a mechanism to recommend semantically relevant service goals to help users refine their initial queries. Relevant services are retrieved by matching user selected service goals with those of candidate services. To improve the recall of the goal-based service discovery approach, we further propose a hybrid approach by integrating it with two existing service discovery approaches. A series of experiments conducted on real-world services crawled from a publicly accessible registry, ProgrammableWeb, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

abstract,"Abstract Provenance refers to the entire amount of information, comprising all the elements and their relationships, that contribute to the existence of a piece of data. The knowledge of provenance data allows a great number of benefits such as verifying a product, result reproductivity, sharing and reuse of knowledge, or assessing data quality and validity. With such tangible benefits, it is no wonder that in recent years, research on provenance has grown exponentially, and has been applied to a wide range of different scientific disciplines. Some years ago, managing and recording provenance information were performed manually. Given the huge volume of information available nowadays, the manual performance of such tasks is no longer an option. The problem of systematically performing tasks such as the understanding, capture and management of provenance has gained significant attention by the research community and industry over the past decades. As a consequence, there has been a huge amount of contributions and proposed provenance systems as solutions for performing such kinds of tasks. The overall objective of this paper is to plot the landscape of published systems in the field of provenance, with two main purposes. First, we seek to evaluate the desired characteristics that provenance systems are expected to have. Second, we aim at identifying a set of representative systems (both early and recent use) to be exhaustively analyzed according to such characteristics. In particular, we have performed a systematic literature review of studies, identifying a comprehensive set of 105 relevant resources in all. The results show that there are common aspects or characteristics of provenance systems thoroughly renowned throughout the literature on the topic. Based on these results, we have defined a six-dimensional taxonomy of provenance characteristics attending to: general aspects, data capture, data access, subject, storage, and non-functional aspects. Additionally, the study has found that there are 25 most referenced provenance systems within the provenance context. This study exhaustively analyzes and compares such systems attending to our taxonomy and pinpoints future directions."

abstract,"Abstract Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a popular method for measuring the similarity of time series. It is widely used in various domains. A major drawback of DTW is that it has a high computational complexity. To address this problem, pruning techniques to calculate the exact DTW distance, as well as DTW approximation methods, have become important approaches. In this paper, we introduce Blocked Dynamic Time Warping (BDTW), a new similarity measure which works on run-length encoded time series representation. BDTW utilizes any repetitive values (zero and nonzero) in time series to reduce DTW computation time. BDTW closely approximates DTW distance, and it is significantly faster than traditional DTW for time series with high levels of value repetition. Moreover, BDTW can be combined with time series representation methods which provide constant segments, to serve as a close approximation method even for the time series without value repetition. Constrained BDTW, BDTW upper bound and BDTW lower bound are discussed as variations of BDTW. BDTW upper bound and BDTW lower bound are presented as a new DTW upper bound and lower bound which can be efficiently applied on time series with high levels of value repetition for pruning unhopeful alignments and matches in the exact DTW calculation. We show the effectiveness of BDTW and its variations on different applications using the following datasets: Almanac of Minutely Power, Refit Smart Homes, as well as the 85 datasets from the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive (UCR archive)."

abstract,"Abstract Check-in facility in a location-based social network (LBSN) enables people to share location information as well as real-life activities. Analysing these historical series of check-ins to predict the future locations to be visited has been very popular in the research community. However, it has been found that people do not intend to share the privately visited locations and activities in a LBSN. Research into extrapolating unchecked locations from historical data is limited. Knowledge of hidden locations can have a wide range of benefits to society. It may help the investigating agencies in identifying possible places visited by a suspect, a marketing company in selecting potential customers for targeted marketing, for medical representatives in identifying areas for disease prevention and containment, etc. In this paper, we propose an Associative Location Prediction Model (ALPM), which infers privately visited unchecked locations from a published user trajectory. The proposed ALPM explores the association between a user’s checked-in data, the Hidden Markov Model and proximal locations around a published check-in for predicting the unchecked or hidden locations. We evaluate ALPM on real-world Gowalla LBSN dataset for the users residing in Beijing, China. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art work in the literature."

abstract,"Abstract In cluster analysis, determining number of clusters is an important issue because information about the most appropriate number of clusters do not exist in the real-world problems. Automatic clustering is a clustering approach which is able to automatically find the most suitable number of clusters as well as divide the instances into the corresponding clusters. This study proposes a novel automatic clustering algorithm using a hybrid of improved artificial bee colony optimization algorithm and K-means algorithm (iABC). The proposed iABC algorithm improves the onlooker bee exploration scheme by directing their movements to a better location. Instead of using a random neighborhood location, the improved onlooker bee considers the data centroid to find a better initial centroid for the K-means algorithm. To increase efficiency of the improvement, the updating process is only applied on the worst cluster centroid. The proposed iABC algorithm is verified using some benchmark datasets. The computational result indicates that the proposed iABC algorithm outperforms the original ABC algorithm for automatic clustering problem. Furthermore, the proposed iABC algorithm is utilized to solve the customer segmentation problem. The result reveals that the iABC algorithm has better and more stable result than original ABC algorithm."

abstract,"Abstract Characterizing large complex networks such as online social networks through node querying is a challenging task. Network service providers often impose severe constraints on the query rate, hence limiting the sample size to a small fraction of the total network of interest. Various ad hoc subgraph sampling methods have been proposed, but many of them give biased estimates and no theoretical basis on the accuracy. In this work, we focus on developing sampling methods for large networks where querying a node also reveals partial structural information about its neighbors. Our methods are optimized for NoSQL graph databases (if the database can be accessed directly), or utilize Web APIs available on most major large networks for graph sampling. We show that our sampling method has provable convergence guarantees on being an unbiased estimator, and it is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. We also explore methods to uncover shortest paths between a subset of nodes and detect high degree nodes by sampling only a small fraction of the network of interest. Our results demonstrate that utilizing neighborhood information yields methods that are two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods."

abstract,"Abstract Anomalies are those deviating significantly from the norm. Thus, anomaly detection amounts to finding data points located far away from their neighbors, i.e., those lying in low-density regions. Classic anomaly detection methods are largely designed for single data type such as continuous or discrete. However, real-world data is increasingly heterogeneous, where a data point can have both discrete and continuous attributes. Mixed data poses multiple challenges including (a) capturing the inter-type correlation structures and (b) measuring deviation from the norm under multiple types. These challenges are exaggerated under (c) high-dimensional regimes. In this paper, we propose a new scalable unsupervised anomaly detection method for mixed data based on Mixed-variate Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Mv.RBM). The Mv.RBM is a principled probabilistic method that estimates density of mixed data. We propose to use free energy derived from Mv.RBM as anomaly score as it is identical to data negative log-density up to an additive constant. We then extend this method to detect anomalies across multiple levels of data abstraction, an effective approach to deal with high-dimensional settings. The extension is dubbed \(\mathtt {MIXMAD}\), which stands for MIXed data Multilevel Anomaly Detection. In \(\mathtt {MIXMAD}\), we sequentially construct an ensemble of mixed-data Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) with varying depths. Each DBN is an energy-based detector at a predefined abstraction level. Predictions across the ensemble are finally combined via a simple rank aggregation method. The proposed methods are evaluated on a comprehensive suit of synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets. The results demonstrate that for anomaly detection, (a) a proper handling of mixed types is necessary, (b) free energy is a powerful anomaly scoring method, (c) multilevel abstraction of data is important for high-dimensional data, and (d) empirically Mv.RBM and \(\mathtt {MIXMAD}\) are superior to popular unsupervised detection methods for both homogeneous and mixed data."

abstract,"Abstract This paper proposes an approach called feature weighted confidence with support vector machine (FWC–SVM) to incorporate prior knowledge into SVM with sample confidence. First, we use prior features to express prior knowledge. Second, FWC–SVM is biased to assign larger weights for prior weights in the slope vector \(\omega \) than weights corresponding to non-prior features. Third, FWC–SVM employs an adaptive paradigm to update sample confidence and feature weights iteratively. We conduct extensive experiments to compare FWC–SVM with the state-of-the-art methods including standard SVM, WSVM, and WMSVM on an English dataset as Reuters-21578 text collection and a Chinese dataset as TanCorpV1.0 text collection. Experimental results demonstrate that in case of non-noisy data, FWC–SVM outperforms other methods when the retaining level is not larger than 0.8. In case of noisy data, FWC–SVM can produce better performance than WSVM on Reuters-21578 dataset when the retaining level is larger than 0.4 and on TanCorpV1.0 dataset when the retaining level is larger than 0.5. We also discuss the strength and weakness of the proposed FWC–SVM approach."

abstract,"Abstract Hypernym–hyponym (“is-a”) relations are key components in taxonomies, object hierarchies and knowledge graphs. Robustly harvesting of such relations requires the analysis of the linguistic characteristics of is-a word pairs in the target language. While there is abundant research on is-a relation extraction in English, it still remains a challenge to accurately identify such relations from Chinese knowledge sources due to the flexibility of language expression and the significant differences between the two language families. In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised framework to extract Chinese is-a relations from user-generated categories. It employs piecewise linear projection models trained on an existing Chinese taxonomy built from Wikipedia and an iterative learning algorithm to update model parameters incrementally. A pattern-based relation selection method is proposed to prevent “semantic drift” in the learning process using bi-criteria optimization. Experimental results on the publicly available test set illustrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

abstract,"Abstract Contextual advertising focuses on placing suitable advertisements on web pages. To attract user’s intention, the advertisements should be highly related to the target web page. The most effective way to do contextual advertising is ontology-based matching algorithms. The main problem of such algorithms is the difficulty in constructing and populating the ontology for matching advertisements. In this paper, we propose an automatic construction method for advertisement ontology. The construction method searches related documents from Web, extracts keywords and weights keywords for concepts. The weighted keywords are treated as instances of concepts and used to generate centroid vectors for concepts. In order to weight keywords in a proper way, we raise a formula WebSSR (Super-Subordinate Relation by Web). WebSSR weights words based on the probabilities that they have Specific Relations with the target concept. We compare our formula with LDA, NGD, WebJaccard, WebOverlap, WebDice and WebPMI, and our formula outperforms all of them. Experiment results also show that our method is more effective than five baseline methods: Bayesian, SVM, SLSA, LDA and Paragraph2Vec."

abstract,"Abstract With computers and the Internet being essential in everyday life, malware poses serious and evolving threats to their security, making the detection of malware of utmost concern. Accordingly, there have been many researches on intelligent malware detection by applying data mining and machine learning techniques. Though great results have been achieved with these methods, most of them are built on shallow learning architectures. Due to its superior ability in feature learning through multilayer deep architecture, deep learning is starting to be leveraged in industrial and academic research for different applications. In this paper, based on the Windows application programming interface calls extracted from the portable executable files, we study how a deep learning architecture can be designed for intelligent malware detection. We propose a heterogeneous deep learning framework composed of an AutoEncoder stacked up with multilayer restricted Boltzmann machines and a layer of associative memory to detect newly unknown malware. The proposed deep learning model performs as a greedy layer-wise training operation for unsupervised feature learning, followed by supervised parameter fine-tuning. Different from the existing works which only made use of the files with class labels (either malicious or benign) during the training phase, we utilize both labeled and unlabeled file samples to pre-train multiple layers in the heterogeneous deep learning framework from bottom to up for feature learning. A comprehensive experimental study on a real and large file collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. Promising experimental results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning framework can further improve the overall performance in malware detection compared with traditional shallow learning methods, deep learning methods with homogeneous framework, and other existing anti-malware scanners. The proposed heterogeneous deep learning framework can also be readily applied to other malware detection tasks."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel edge modification technique that better preserves the communities of a graph while anonymizing it. By maintaining the core number sequence of a graph, its coreness, we retain most of the information contained in the network while allowing changes in the degree sequence, i. e. obfuscating the visible data an attacker has access to. We reach a better trade-off between data privacy and data utility than with existing methods by capitalizing on the slack between apparent degree (node degree) and true degree (node core number). Our extensive experiments on six diverse standard network datasets support this claim. Our framework compares our method to other that are used as proxies for privacy protection in the relevant literature. We demonstrate that our method leads to higher data utility preservation, especially in clustering, for the same levels of randomization and k-anonymity."

abstract,"Abstract The success of recommender systems has made them the focus of a massive research effort in both industry and academia. Recent work has generalized recommendations to suggest packages of items to single users, or single items to groups of users. However, to the best of our knowledge, the interesting problem of recommending a package to a group of users (P2G) has not been studied to date. This is a problem with several practical applications, such as recommending vacation packages to tourist groups, entertainment packages to groups of friends or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we formulate the P2G problem, and we propose probabilistic models that capture the preference of a group toward a package, incorporating factors such as user impact and package viability. We also investigate the issue of recommendation fairness. This is a novel consideration that arises in our setting, where we require that no user is consistently slighted by the item selection in the package. In addition, we study a special case of the P2G problem, where the recommended items are places and the recommendation should consider the current locations of the users in the group. We present aggregation algorithms for finding the best packages and compare our suggested models with baseline approaches stemming from previous work. The results show that our models find packages of high quality which consider all special requirements of P2G recommendation."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of process discovery, originating from the area of process mining, is to discover a process model based on business process execution data. A majority of process discovery techniques relies on an event log as an input. An event log is a static source of historical data capturing the execution of a business process. In this paper, we focus on process discovery relying on online streams of business process execution events. Learning process models from event streams poses both challenges and opportunities, i.e. we need to handle unlimited amounts of data using finite memory and, preferably, constant time. We propose a generic architecture that allows for adopting several classes of existing process discovery techniques in context of event streams. Moreover, we provide several instantiations of the architecture, accompanied by implementations in the process mining toolkit ProM (http://promtools.org). Using these instantiations, we evaluate several dimensions of stream-based process discovery. The evaluation shows that the proposed architecture allows us to lift process discovery to the streaming domain."

abstract,"Abstract Tour recommendation and itinerary planning are challenging tasks for tourists, due to their need to select points of interest (POI) to visit in unfamiliar cities and to select POIs that align with their interest preferences and trip constraints. We propose an algorithm called PersTour for recommending personalized tours using POI popularity and user interest preferences, which are automatically derived from real-life travel sequences based on geo-tagged photographs. Our tour recommendation problem is modeled using a formulation of the Orienteering problem and considers user trip constraints such as time limits and the need to start and end at specific POIs. In our work, we also reflect levels of user interest based on visit durations and demonstrate how POI visit duration can be personalized using this time-based user interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PersTour can be further enhanced by: (i) a weighted updating of user interests based on the recency of their POI visits and (ii) an automatic weighting between POI popularity and user interests based on the tourist’s activity level. Using a Flickr dataset of ten cities, our experiments show the effectiveness of PersTour against various collaborative filtering and greedy-based baselines, in terms of tour popularity, interest, recall, precision and F\(_1\)-score. In particular, our results show the merits of using time-based user interest and personalized POI visit durations, compared to the current practice of using frequency-based user interest and average visit durations."

However, the mining may return a huge number of patterns, while the users are only interested in a particular subset of these. In this paper, we consider the problem of mining sequential patterns with itemset constraints. In order to solve this problem, we propose a new algorithm named MSPIC-DBV, which is a pattern-growth algorithm that uses prefixes and dynamic bit vectors. This algorithm prunes the search space at the beginning and during the mining process. Moreover, it reduces the number of candidates that need to be checked. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the previous methods."

abstract,"Abstract Given two spatial point sets R and B in the plane, with cardinalities m and n, respectively, and stored in two separate R-trees, we propose an efficient algorithm to verify whether R and B are linearly separable. The sets R and B are linearly separable if there exists a line that splits the plane into to halfplanes, one containing all R and the other one containing all B. This is the first algorithm that answers the separability question in the context of the spatial data bases. That is, it considers as input big spatial data stored in secondary storage data structures (e.g., the R-tree) which are not allowed to be completely stored in the main memory of the computer to run a classic algorithm. The algorithms designed in this context aim to minimize as much as possible the number of blocks read from the secondary storage data structures to the main memory. Studied problems in this setting are the k-nearest neighbor problem and the spatial range query problem. Our algorithm explicitly exploits the geometric and spatial properties of the R-trees to access only the nodes relevant to decide the linear separability of the given sets. Our experimental results show the efficiency of the algorithm, since it accesses between the 0.34 and 2.79% of the nodes of the R-trees. We also analyze the asymptotic running time of the algorithm, showing that it runs in \(O(m\log m + n\log n)\) time in the worst case."

abstract,"Abstract Financial distress prediction is very important to financial institutions who must be able to make critical decisions regarding customer loans. Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are the two main aspects considered in financial distress prediction. To assist in this determination, thereby lowering the risk borne by the financial institution, it is necessary to develop effective prediction models for prediction of the likelihood of bankruptcy and estimation of credit risk. A number of financial distress prediction models have been constructed, which utilize various machine learning techniques, such as single classifiers and classifier ensembles, but improving the prediction accuracy is the major research issue. In addition, aside from improving the prediction accuracy, there have been very few studies that specifically consider lowering the Type I error. In practice, Type I errors need to receive careful consideration during model construction because they can affect the cost to the financial institution. In this study, we introduce a classifier ensemble approach designed to reduce the misclassification cost. The outputs produced by multiple classifiers are combined by utilizing the unanimous voting (UV) method to find the final prediction result. Experimental results obtained based on four relevant datasets show that our UV ensemble approach outperforms the baseline single classifiers and classifier ensembles. Specifically, the UV ensemble not only provides relatively good prediction accuracy and minimizes Type I/II errors, but also produces the smallest misclassification cost."

The outliers are then detected by an optimization problem of a new proposed cost function adapted to this kind of data. Finally, we provide some experimental results for validating our proposal and comparing it with other methods of detection."

abstract,"Abstract Success of a scientific entity generally undergoes myriad vicissitudes, resulting in different patterns of success trajectories. Understanding and characterizing the rise and fall of scientific success is important not only from the perspective of designing new mathematical models but also to enhance the quality of various real-world systems such as scientific article search and recommendation systems. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of the subject by analyzing the success of two major scientific entities—papers and authors—in Computer Science and Physics. We quantify “success” in terms of citations and in the process discover six distinct success trajectories which are prevalent across multidisciplinary datasets. Our results reveal that these trajectories are not fully random, but are rather generated through a complex process. We further shed light on the behavior of these trajectories and unfold many interesting facets by asking fundamental questions—which trajectory is more successful, how significant and stable are these categories, what factors trigger the rise and fall of trajectories? A few of our findings sharply contradict the well-accepted beliefs on bibliographic research such as “Preferential Attachment”, “first-mover advantage”. We believe that this study will argue in favor of revising the existing metrics used for quantifying scientific success."

abstract,"Abstract The design process involves multiple stages to provide the solution for an actual or perceived need. The process needs different information at different stages to generate the desired output, but most of the time, the information is uncertain. Information uncertainty almost always makes design decision critical. The present work aims to reduce this information uncertainty in product design by reusing previous design knowledge. Reusing an existing ontology is an obvious way to minimize information uncertainty, and consequently, it can shorten the manufacturing lead time. However, the existing techniques have a few gaps that are still unaddressed. To fill these gaps, a methodology based on bionic engineering is proposed in this work for the purpose of design reuse in product development. Here, for the representation and manipulation of the knowledge, bionic-based reasoning approach is used for the development of the new product with the help of bionic reverse engineering. The proposed methodology is validated by illustrating an example of shoe design suitable to maneuver ill-conditioned roads. This work would be useful to the design and manufacturing practitioner in product development and decision making."

abstract,"Abstract Literature on business process compliance (BPC) has predominantly focused on the alignment of the regulatory rules with the design, verification and validation of business processes. Previously, surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches and categorises them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000 and 2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches centre around three distinct categories, namely design-time (\(28\%\)), run-time (\(32\%\)) and auditing (\(10\%\)). Also, organisational and internal control-based compliance management frameworks (\(21\%\)) and hybrid approaches make (\(9\%\)) of the surveyed approaches. Furthermore, open research challenges and gaps are identified and discussed with respect to the compliance problem."

abstract,"Abstract Feature selection (FS) is a key research area in the machine learning and data mining fields; removing irrelevant and redundant features usually helps to reduce the effort required to process a dataset while maintaining or even improving the processing algorithm’s accuracy. However, traditional algorithms designed for executing on a single machine lack scalability to deal with the increasing amount of data that have become available in the current Big Data era. ReliefF is one of the most important algorithms successfully implemented in many FS applications. In this paper, we present a completely redesigned distributed version of the popular ReliefF algorithm based on the novel Spark cluster computing model that we have called DiReliefF. The effectiveness of our proposal is tested on four publicly available datasets, all of them with a large number of instances and two of them with also a large number of features. Subsets of these datasets were also used to compare the results to a non-distributed implementation of the algorithm. The results show that the non-distributed implementation is unable to handle such large volumes of data without specialized hardware, while our design can process them in a scalable way with much better processing times and memory usage."

abstract,"Abstract Information cascades are ubiquitous in various online social networks. Outbreak of cascades could cause huge and unexpected effects. Therefore, predicting the outbreak of cascades at early stage is of vital importance to avoid potential bad effects and take relevant actions. Existing methods either adopt regression or classification technique with exhaustive feature engineering or predict cascade dynamics via modeling the stochastic process of cascades using a hard-coded diffusion–reaction function. One salient issue of these methods is that these methods heavily depend on human-defined knowledge, features or functions. In this paper, we propose to use recurrent neural network with long short-term memory to directly learn sequential patterns from information cascades, working in a fully data-driven manner. With the learned sequential patterns, the outbreak of cascade could be accurately predicted. Extensive experiments on both Twitter and Sina Weibo datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at the prediction of cascade outbreaks."

abstract,"Abstract Preference learning is a fundamental problem in various smart computing applications such as personalized recommendation. Collaborative filtering as a major learning technique aims to make use of users’ feedback, for which some recent works have switched from exploiting explicit feedback to implicit feedback. One fundamental challenge of leveraging implicit feedback is the lack of negative feedback, because there is only some observed relatively “positive” feedback available, making it difficult to learn a prediction model. In this paper, we propose a new and relaxed assumption of pairwise preferences over item-sets, which defines a user’s preference on a set of items (item-set) instead of on a single item only. The relaxed assumption can give us more accurate pairwise preference relationships. With this assumption, we further develop a general algorithm called CoFiSet (collaborative filtering via learning pairwise preferences over item-sets), which contains four variants, CoFiSet(SS), CoFiSet(MOO), CoFiSet(MOS) and CoFiSet(MSO), representing “Set vs. Set,” “Many ‘One vs. One’,” “Many ‘One vs. Set”’ and “Many ‘Set vs. One”’ pairwise comparisons, respectively. Experimental results show that our CoFiSet(MSO) performs better than several state-of-the-art methods on five ranking-oriented evaluation metrics on three real-world data sets."

abstract,"Abstract Redescription mining aims at finding pairs of queries over data variables that describe roughly the same set of observations. These redescriptions can be used to obtain different views on the same set of entities. So far, redescription mining methods have aimed at listing all redescriptions supported by the data. Such an approach can result in many redundant redescriptions and hinder the user’s ability to understand the overall characteristics of the data. In this work, we present an approach to identify and remove the redundant redescriptions, that is, an approach to move from a set of good redescriptions to a good set of redescriptions. We measure the redundancy of a redescription using a framework inspired by the concept of subjective interestingness based on maximum entropy distributions as proposed by De Bie (Data Min Knowl Discov 23(3):407–446, 2011). Redescriptions, however, generate specific requirements on the framework, and our solution differs significantly from the existing ones. Notably, our approach can handle disjunctions and conjunctions in the queries, whereas the existing approaches are limited only to conjunctive queries. Our framework can also handle data with Boolean, nominal, or real-valued data, possibly containing missing values, making it applicable to a wide variety of data sets. Our experiments show that our framework can efficiently reduce the redundancy even on large data sets."

In this study, we first formalize why-not questions on SPARQL queries and then propose a novel explanation model, called answering why-not questions on SPARQL (ANNA) to answer why-not questions using a divide-and-conquer strategy. ANNA adopts a graph-based approach and an operator-based approach to generate logical explanations at the triple pattern level and the query operator level, respectively, which helps users refine their initial queries. Extensive experimental results on two real-world RDF datasets show that the proposed model and algorithms can provide high-quality explanations in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency."

abstract,"Abstract Outlier detection algorithms are often computationally intensive because of their need to score each point in the data. Even simple distance-based algorithms have quadratic complexity. High-dimensional outlier detection algorithms such as subspace methods are often even more computationally intensive because of their need to explore different subspaces of the data. In this paper, we propose an exceedingly simple subspace outlier detection algorithm, which can be implemented in a few lines of code, and whose complexity is linear in the size of the data set and the space requirement is constant. We show that this outlier detection algorithm is much faster than both conventional and high-dimensional algorithms and also provides more accurate results. The approach uses randomized hashing to score data points and has a neat subspace interpretation. We provide a visual representation of this interpretability in terms of outlier sensitivity histograms. Furthermore, the approach can be easily generalized to data streams, where it provides an efficient approach to discover outliers in real time. We present experimental results showing the effectiveness of the approach over other state-of-the-art methods."

CSOS has been tested with 23 standard benchmark functions and 2 engineering design problems. The results show that CSOS has better ability of finding global optimal value and higher precision."

abstract,"Abstract Graph clustering is successfully applied in various applications for finding similar patterns. Recently, deep learning- based autoencoder has been used efficiently for detecting disjoint clusters. However, in real-world graphs, vertices may belong to multiple clusters. Thus, it is obligatory to analyze the membership of vertices toward clusters. Furthermore, existing approaches are centralized and are inefficient in handling large graphs. In this paper, a deep learning-based model ‘DFuzzy’ is proposed for finding fuzzy clusters from large graphs in distributed environment. It performs clustering in three phases. In first phase, pre-training is performed by initializing the candidate cluster centers. Then, fine tuning is performed to learn the latent representations by mining the local information and capturing the structure using PageRank. Further, modularity is used to redefine clusters. In last phase, reconstruction error is minimized and final cluster centers are updated. Experiments are performed over real-life graph data, and the performance of DFuzzy is compared with four state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Results  show that DFuzzy scales up linearly to handle large graphs and produces better quality of clusters when compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. It is also observed that deep structures can help in getting better graph representations and provide improved clustering performance."

Secondly, a top-n recommender system which finds a list of items predicted to be most relevant for a given user. The proposed methods are assessed using a variety of different metrics and are shown to be competitive with existing collaborative filtering recommender systems. Specifically, the sparse dictionary-based predictive recommender has advantages over existing methods in terms of a lower computational cost and not requiring parameter tuning. The sparse dictionary-based top-n recommender system has advantages over existing methods in terms of the accuracy of the predictions it makes and not requiring parameter tuning. An open-source software implemented and used for the evaluation in this paper is also provided for reproducibility."

abstract,"Abstract Community detection is a significant research problem in various fields such as computer science, sociology and biology. The singular characteristic of communities in social networks is the multimembership of a node resulting in overlapping communities. But dealing with the problem of overlapping community detection is computationally expensive. The evolution of communities in social networks happens due to the self-interest of the nodes. The nodes of the social network acts as self-interested players, who wish to maximize their benefit through interactions in due course of community formation. Game theory provides a systematic framework tox capture the interactions between these selfish players in the form of games. In this paper, we propose a Community Detection Game (CDG) that works under the cooperative game framework. We develop a greedy community detection algorithm that employs Shapley value mechanism and majority voting mechanism in order to disclose the underlying community structure of the given network. Extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of CDG algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms."

abstract,"Abstract Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used in topic modeling of large-scale document corpora, where a set of underlying topics are extracted by a low-rank factor matrix from NMF. However, the resulting topics often convey only general, thus redundant information about the documents rather than information that might be minor, but potentially meaningful to users. To address this problem, we present a novel ensemble method based on nonnegative matrix factorization that discovers meaningful local topics. Our method leverages the idea of an ensemble model, which has shown advantages in supervised learning, into an unsupervised topic modeling context. That is, our model successively performs NMF given a residual matrix obtained from previous stages and generates a sequence of topic sets. The algorithm we employ to update is novel in two aspects. The first lies in utilizing the residual matrix inspired by a state-of-the-art gradient boosting model, and the second stems from applying a sophisticated local weighting scheme on the given matrix to enhance the locality of topics, which in turn delivers high-quality, focused topics of interest to users. We subsequently extend this ensemble model by adding keyword- and document-based user interaction to introduce user-driven topic discovery."

abstract,"Abstract Location privacy is extensively studied in the context of location-based services (LBSs). Typically, users are assigned a location privacy profile and the precise locations are cloaked so that the privacy profile is not compromised. Though being well-defined for snapshot location privacy, these solutions require additional precautions and patches in case of consecutive LBS requests on the user trajectory. The attacker can exploit some background knowledge like maximum velocity to compromise the privacy profile. To protect against this kind of location privacy attacks, PROBE (Damiani et al. in Trans Data Priv 3(2):123–148, 2010)-like systems constantly check location privacy violations and alter requests as necessary. Clearly, the location privacy is defined in terms of snapshot locations. Observing that there are usually user-specific movement patterns existing in the shared LBS requests, this work extends location privacy to location pattern privacy. We present a framework where user-specific sensitive movement patterns are defined and sanitized in offline and online fashions, respectively. Our solution uses an efficient dynamic programming approach to decide on and to prevent sensitive pattern disclosure. An extensive experimental evaluation has been carried out too."

abstract,"Abstract Predicting long-term outcomes of interventions is necessary for educational and social policy-making processes that might widely influence our society for the long term. However, performing such predictions based on data from large-scale experiments might be challenging due to the lack of time and resources. In order to address this issue, computer simulations based on evolutionary causal matrices and Markov chain can be used to predict long-term outcomes with relatively small-scale laboratory data. In this paper, we introduce Python classes implementing a computer simulation model and presented some pilot implementations demonstrating how the model can be utilized for predicting outcomes of diverse interventions. We also introduce the class-structured simulation module both with real experimental data and with hypothetical data formulated based on social psychological theories. Classes developed and tested in the present study provide researchers and practitioners with a feasible and practical method to simulate intervention outcomes prospectively."

abstract,"Abstract Data-trained predictive models see widespread use, but for the most part they are used as black boxes which output a prediction or score. It is therefore hard to acquire a deeper understanding of model behavior and in particular how different features influence the model prediction. This is important when interpreting the behavior of complex models or asserting that certain problematic attributes (such as race or gender) are not unduly influencing decisions. In this paper, we present a technique for auditing black-box models, which lets us study the extent to which existing models take advantage of particular features in the data set, without knowing how the models work. Our work focuses on the problem of indirect influence: how some features might indirectly influence outcomes via other, related features. As a result, we can find attribute influences even in cases where, upon further direct examination of the model, the attribute is not referred to by the model at all. Our approach does not require the black-box model to be retrained. This is important if, for example, the model is only accessible via an API, and contrasts our work with other methods that investigate feature influence such as feature selection. We present experimental evidence for the effectiveness of our procedure using a variety of publicly available data sets and models. We also validate our procedure using techniques from interpretable learning and feature selection, as well as against other black-box auditing procedures. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we use it to audit a black-box recidivism prediction algorithm."

abstract,"Abstract Linear and logistic regression are popular statistical techniques for analyzing multi-variate data. Typically, analysts do not simply posit a particular form of the regression model, estimate its parameters, and use the results for inference or prediction. Instead, they first use a variety of diagnostic techniques to assess how well the model fits the relationships in the data and how well it can be expected to predict outcomes for out-of-sample records, revising the model as necessary to improve fit and predictive power. In this article, we develop \(\epsilon \)-differentially private diagnostics tools for regression, beginning to fill a gap in privacy-preserving data analysis. Specifically, we create differentially private versions of residual plots for linear regression and of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as binned residual plot for logistic regression. The residual plot and binned residual plot help determine whether or not the data satisfy the assumptions underlying the regression model, and the ROC curve is used to assess the predictive power of the logistic regression model. These diagnostics improve the usefulness of algorithms for computing differentially private regression output, which alone does not allow analysts to assess the quality of the posited model. Our empirical studies show that these algorithms can be effective tools for allowing users to evaluate the quality of their models."

abstract,"Abstract Dynamic time warping (DTW) distance has been effectively used in mining time series data in a multitude of domains. However, in its original formulation DTW is extremely inefficient in comparing long sparse time series, containing mostly zeros and some unevenly spaced nonzero observations. Original DTW distance does not take advantage of this sparsity, leading to redundant calculations and a prohibitively large computational cost for long time series. We derive a new time warping similarity measure (AWarp) for sparse time series that works on the run-length encoded representation of sparse time series. The complexity of AWarp is quadratic on the number of observations as opposed to the range of time of the time series. Therefore, AWarp can be several orders of magnitude faster than DTW on sparse time series. AWarp is exact for binary-valued time series and a close approximation of the original DTW distance for any-valued series. We discuss useful variants of AWarp: bounded (both upper and lower), constrained, and multidimensional. We show applications of AWarp to three data mining tasks including clustering, classification, and outlier detection, which are otherwise not feasible using classic DTW, while producing equivalent results. Potential areas of application include bot detection, human activity classification, search trend analysis, seismic analysis, and unusual review pattern mining."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we present a new nonparametric calibration method called ensemble of near-isotonic regression (ENIR). The method can be considered as an extension of BBQ (Naeini et al., in: Proceedings of twenty-ninth AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2015b), a recently proposed calibration method, as well as the commonly used calibration method based on isotonic regression (IsoRegC) (Zadrozny and Elkan, in: Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining 2002). ENIR is designed to address the key limitation of IsoRegC which is the monotonicity assumption of the predictions. Similar to BBQ, the method post-processes the output of a binary classifier to obtain calibrated probabilities. Thus, it can be used with many existing classification models to generate accurate probabilistic predictions. We demonstrate the performance of ENIR on synthetic and real datasets for commonly applied binary classification models. Experimental results show that the method outperforms several common binary classifier calibration methods. In particular, on the real data, we evaluated ENIR commonly performs statistically significantly better than the other methods, and never worse. It is able to improve the calibration power of classifiers, while retaining their discrimination power. The method is also computationally tractable for large-scale datasets, as it is \(O(N \log N)\) time, where N is the number of samples."

abstract,"Abstract Time series motifs are approximately repeated subsequences found within a longer time series. They have been in the literature since 2002, but recently they have begun to receive significant attention in research and industrial communities. This is perhaps due to the growing realization that they implicitly offer solutions to a host of time series problems, including rule discovery, anomaly detection, density estimation, semantic segmentation, summarization, etc. Recent work has improved the scalability so exact motifs can be computed on datasets with up to a million data points in tenable time. However, in some domains, for example seismology or climatology, there is an immediate need to address even larger datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that a combination of a novel algorithm and a high-performance GPU allows us to significantly improve the scalability of motif discovery. We demonstrate the scalability of our ideas by finding the full set of exact motifs on a dataset with one hundred and forty-three million subsequences, which is by far the largest dataset ever mined for time series motifs/joins; it requires ten quadrillion pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithm can produce actionable insights into seismology and ethology."

abstract,"Abstract Mining subgraph patterns is an active area of research due to its wide-ranging applications. Examples include frequent subgraph mining, discriminative subgraph mining, statistically significant subgraphs. Existing research has primarily focused on mining all subgraph patterns in the database. However, due to the exponential subgraph search space, the number of patterns mined, typically, is too large for any human-mediated analysis. Consequently, deriving insights from the mined patterns is hard for domain scientists. In addition, subgraph pattern mining is posed in multiple forms: the function that models if a subgraph is a pattern varies based on the application and the database could be over multiple graphs or a single, large graph. In this paper, we ask the following question: Given a subgraph importance function and a budget k, which are the k subgraph patterns that best represent all other patterns of interest? We show that the problem is NP-hard, and propose a generic framework called Resling that adapts to arbitrary subgraph importance functions and generalizable to both transactional graph databases as well as single, large graphs. Resling derives its power by structuring the search space in the form of an edit map, where each subgraph is a node, and two subgraphs are connected if they have an edit distance of one. We rank nodes in the edit map through two random walk based algorithms: vertex-reinforced random walks ( Resling -VR) and negative-reinforced random walks( Resling -NR). Experiments show that Resling-VR is up to 20 times more representative of the pattern space and two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art techniques. Resling-NR further improves the running time while maintaining comparable or better performance in representative power."

abstract,"Abstract Dimensionality reduction is often a crucial step for the successful application of machine learning and data mining methods. One way to achieve said reduction is feature selection. Due to the impossibility of labelling many data sets, unsupervised approaches are frequently the only option. The column subset selection problem translates naturally to this purpose and has received considerable attention over the last few years, as it provides simple linear models for low-rank data reconstruction. Recently, it was empirically shown that an iterative algorithm, which can be implemented efficiently, provides better subsets than other state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we describe this algorithm and provide a more in-depth analysis. We carry out numerous experiments to gain insights on its behaviour and derive a simple bound for the norm recovered by the resulting matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result of this kind for this algorithm."

abstract,"Abstract Mining of spatial data is an enabling technology for mobile services, Internet-connected cars and the Internet of Things. But the very distinctiveness of spatial data that drives utility can cost user privacy. Past work has focused upon points and trajectories for differentially private release. In this work, we continue the tradition of privacy-preserving spatial analytics, focusing not on point or path data, but on planar spatial regions. Such data represent the area of a user’s most frequent visitation—such as “around home and nearby shops”. Specifically we consider the differentially private release of data structures that support range queries for counting users’ spatial regions. Counting planar regions leads to unique challenges not faced in existing work. A user’s spatial region that straddles multiple data structure cells can lead to duplicate counting at query time. We provably avoid this pitfall by leveraging the Euler characteristic for the first time with differential privacy. To address the increased sensitivity of range queries to spatial region data, we calibrate privacy-preserving noise using bounded user region size and a constrained inference that uses robust least absolute deviations. Our novel constrained inference reduces noise and promotes covertness by (privately) imposing consistency. We provide a full end-to-end theoretical analysis of both differential privacy and high-probability utility for our approach using concentration bounds. A comprehensive experimental study on several real-world datasets establishes practical validity."

abstract,"Abstract Data mining in non-stationary data streams is particularly relevant in the context of Internet of Things and Big Data. Its challenges arise from fundamentally different drift types violating assumptions of data independence or stationarity. Available methods often struggle with certain forms of drift or require unavailable a priori task knowledge. We propose the Self-Adjusting Memory (SAM) model for the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm. SAM-kNN can deal with heterogeneous concept drift, i.e., different drift types and rates, using biologically inspired memory models and their coordination. Its basic idea is to have dedicated models for current and former concepts used according to the demands of the given situation. It can be easily applied in practice without meta parameter optimization. We conduct an extensive evaluation on various benchmarks, consisting of artificial streams with known drift characteristics and real-world datasets. We explicitly add new benchmarks enabling a precise performance analysis on multiple types of drift. Highly competitive results throughout all experiments underline the robustness of SAM-kNN as well as its capability to handle heterogeneous concept drift. Knowledge about drift characteristics in streaming data is not only crucial for a precise algorithm evaluation, but it also facilitates the choice of an appropriate algorithm on real-world applications. Therefore, we additionally propose two tests, able to determine the type and strength of drift. We extract the drift characteristics of all utilized datasets and use it for our analysis of the SAM in relation to other methods."

abstract,"Abstract Research on recommendation systems has gained a considerable amount of attention over the past decade as the number of online users and online contents continue to grow at an exponential rate. With the evolution of the social web, people generate and consume data in real time using online services such as Twitter, Facebook, and web news portals. With the rapidly growing online community, web-based retail systems and social media sites have to process several millions of user requests per day. Generating quality recommendations using this vast amount of data is itself a very challenging task. Nevertheless, opposed to the web-based retailers such as Amazon and Netflix, the above-mentioned social networking sites have to face an additional challenge when generating recommendations as their contents are very rapidly changing. Therefore, providing fresh information in the least amount of time is a major objective of such recommender systems. Although collaborative filtering is a widely used technique in recommendation systems, generating the recommendation model using this approach is a costly task, and often done offline. Hence, it is difficult to use collaborative filtering in the presence of dynamically changing contents, as such systems require frequent updates to the recommendation model to maintain the accuracy and the freshness of the recommendations. Parallel processing power of graphic processing units (GPUs) can be used to process large volumes of data with dynamically changing contents in real time, and accelerate the recommendation process for social media data streams. In this paper, we address the issue of rapidly changing contents, and propose a parallel on-the-fly collaborative filtering algorithm using GPUs to facilitate frequent updates to the recommendations model. We use a hybrid similarity calculation method by combining the item–item collaborative filtering with item category information and temporal information. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperformed several existing online CF algorithms in terms of accuracy, memory consumption, and runtime. It was also observed that the proposed algorithm scaled well with the data rate and the data volume, and generated recommendations in a timely manner."

Functional labels summarize and highlight the main characteristics of a business, which can serve as bridges between the consumption needs and the service functions. We consider two kinds of semantic similarities: lexical similarity and embedding similarity, which characterize the relatedness in two different perspectives. To measure the lexical similarity, we use the classic probabilistic ranking formula, i.e., BM25; to measure the embedding similarity, we propose an extended embedding model which can incorporate weak supervised information derived from review text. These two kinds of similarities compensate each other and capture the semantic relatedness in a more comprehensive way. We construct a test collection consisting of four different domains based on a Yelp dataset and consider multiple baseline methods for comparison. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed methods are very effective."

The reviews framed are often made in text format. While processing the text reviews, each word of the review is considered as a feature. Thus, selection of right kind of features needs to be carried out to select the best feature from the set of all features. In this paper, the machine learning algorithm, i.e., support vector machine, is used to select the best features from the training data. These features are then given input to artificial neural network method, to process further. Different performance evaluation parameters such as precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy have been considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two different datasets, i.e., IMDb dataset and polarity dataset."

Crowd labeling is a crowdsourcing approach for gathering such labels from workers whose suggestions are not always accurate.

We show that it performs as well as other methods and at times better on a variety of simulated and actual datasets while treating each label as compositional rather than indicating a discrete class. In addition, prior knowledge of workers’ abilities can be incorporated into the model through a structured Bayesian framework. We then apply CL-LDA to the EEG independent component labeling dataset, using its generalizations to further explore the utility of the algorithm. We discuss prospects for creating classifiers from the generated labels."

The paper evaluates the framework using a real-world smart city data set, and the results verify its effectiveness and efficiency. The framework can be a generic solution to manage smart city data."

abstract,"Abstract Sentiment classification plays an important role in everyday life, in political activities, activities of commodity production and commercial activities. Finding a time-effective and highly accurate solution to the classification of emotions is challenging. Today, there are many models (or methods) to classify the sentiment of documents. Sentiment classification has been studied for many years and is used widely in many different fields. We propose a new model, which is called the valences-totaling model (VTM), by using cosine measure (CM) to classify the sentiment of English documents. VTM is a new model for English sentiment classification. In this study, CM is a measure of similarity between two words and is used to calculate the valence (and polarity) of English semantic lexicons. We prove that CM is able to identify the sentiment valence and the sentiment polarity of the English sentiment lexicons online in combination with the Google search engine with AND operator and OR operator. VTM uses many English semantic lexicons. These English sentiment lexicons are calculated online and are based on the Internet. We present a full range of English sentences; thus, the emotion expressed in the English text is classified with more precision. Our new model is not dependent on a special domain and training data set—it is a domain-independent classifier. We test our new model on the Internet data in English. The calculated valence (and polarity) of English semantic words in this model is based on many documents on millions of English Web sites and English social networks."

abstract,"Abstract We present a knowledge discovery-based framework that is capable of discovering, analyzing and exploiting new intraday price patterns in forex markets, beyond the well-known chart formations of technical analysis. We present a novel pattern recognition algorithm for Pattern Matching, that we successfully used to construct more than 16,000 new intraday price patterns. After processing and analysis, we extracted 3518 chart formations that are capable of predicting the short-term direction of prices. In our experiments, we used forex time series from 8 paired-currencies in various time frames. The system computes the probabilities of events such as “within next 5 periods, price will increase more than 20 pips”. Results  show that the system is capable of finding patterns whose output signals (tested on unseen data) have predictive accuracy which varies between 60 and 85% depending on the type of pattern. We test the usefulness of the discovered patterns, via implementation of an expert system using a straightforward strategy based on the direction and the accuracy of the pattern predictions. We compare our method against three standard trading techniques plus a “random trader,” and we also test against the results presented in two recently published studies. Our framework performs very well against all systems we directly compare , and also, against all other published results."

abstract,"Abstract The ubiquity of sequences in many domains enhances significant recent interest in sequence learning, for which a basic problem is how to measure the distance between sequences. Dynamic time warping (DTW) aligns two sequences by nonlinear local warping and returns a distance value. DTW shows superior ability in many applications, e.g. video, image, etc. However, in DTW, two points are paired essentially based on point-to-point comparisons without considering the autocorrelation of sequences. Thus, points with different semantic meanings, e.g. peaks and valleys, may be matched providing their coordinate values are similar. As a result, DTW may be sensitive to noise and poorly interpretable. This paper proposes an improved alignment method, dynamic state warping (DSW). DSW integrates the dynamic information of sequences into DTW by converting each time point into a latent state. Alignment is performed by using the state sequences. Thus, DSW is able to yield alignment that is semantically more interpretable than that of DTW. Using one nearest neighbour classifier, DSW shows significant improvement on classification accuracy in comparison with Euclidean distance (68/85 wins), DTW (70/85 wins) and its variants. We also empirically demonstrate that DSW is more robust and scales better to long sequences than Euclidean distance and DTW."

abstract,"Abstract Implementing a reputation system is an effective strategy to facilitate trust and security in an online environment. In addition to that, reputation systems can help online customers through decision-making process. However, in real-world situations, these systems have to deal with plenty of problems and challenges. This paper aims to solve four problems that are common to reputation systems in e-marketplaces, namely the subjectivity of ratings, inequality of transactions, multi-context reputation and dynamic behavior of users. The proposed model starts with the pairwise comparison, which is a powerful tool for removing bias from ratings. Then, we extend the concept of pairwise comparison to contests between users. A pairwise comparison has only a winner and a loser, but we can associate a score differential with a pairwise comparison when we consider it as a match. This score differential is adjusted in a way that three other problems can be solved. We implemented our model in a multi-agent simulation in which real-world data were also incorporated. We compared our model with some of previous reputation systems. Experiments show that our model outperforms previous ones when faced with real-world challenges."

abstract,"Abstract Mining financial text documents and understanding the sentiments of individual investors, institutions and markets is an important and challenging problem in the literature. Current approaches to mine sentiments from financial texts largely rely on domain-specific dictionaries. However, dictionary-based methods often fail to accurately predict the polarity of financial texts. This paper aims to improve the state-of-the-art and introduces a novel sentiment analysis approach that employs the concept of financial and non-financial performance indicators. It presents an association rule mining-based hierarchical sentiment classifier model to predict the polarity of financial texts as positive, neutral or negative. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark financial dataset. The model is also compared against other state-of-the-art dictionary and machine learning-based approaches and the results are found to be quite promising. The novel use of performance indicators for financial sentiment analysis offers interesting and useful insights."

abstract,"Abstract Various organizations collect data about individuals for various reasons, such as service improvement. In order to mine the collected data for useful information, data publishing has become a common practice among those organizations and data analysts, research institutes, or simply the general public. The quality of published data significantly affects the accuracy of the data analysis and thus affects decision making at the corporate level. In this study, we explore the research area of privacy-preserving data publishing, i.e., publishing high-quality data without compromising the privacy of the individuals whose data are being published. Syntactic privacy models, such as k-anonymity, impose syntactic privacy requirements and make certain assumptions about an adversary’s background knowledge. To address this shortcoming, we adopt differential privacy, a rigorous privacy model that is independent of any adversary’s knowledge and insensitive to the underlying data. The published data should preserve individuals’ privacy, yet remain useful for analysis. To maintain data utility, we propose DiffMulti, a workload-aware and differentially private algorithm that employs multidimensional generalization. We devise an efficient implementation to the proposed algorithm and use a real-life data set for experimental analysis. We evaluate the performance of our method in terms of data utility, efficiency, and scalability. When compared to closely related existing methods, DiffMulti significantly improved data utility, in some cases, by orders of magnitude."

abstract,"Abstract In order to make a recommendation, a recommender system typically first predicts a user’s ratings for items and then recommends a list of items to the user which have high predicted ratings. Quality of predictions is measured by accuracy, that is, how close the predicted ratings are to actual ratings. On the other hand, quality of recommendation lists is evaluated from more than one perspective. Since accuracy of predicted ratings is not enough for customer satisfaction, metrics such as novelty, serendipity, and diversity are also used to measure the quality of the recommendation lists. Aggregate diversity is one of these metrics which measures the diversity of items across the recommendation lists of all users. Increasing aggregate diversity is important because it leads a more even distribution of items in the recommendation lists which prevents the long-tail problem. In this study, we propose two novel methods to increase aggregate diversity of a recommender system. The first method is a reranking approach which takes a ranked list of recommendations of a user and reranks it to increase aggregate diversity. While the reranking approach is applied after model generation as a wrapper the second method is applied in model generation phase which has the advantage of being more efficient in the generation of recommendation lists. We compare our methods with the well-known methods in the field and show the superiority of our methods using real-world datasets."

abstract,"Abstract In actual applications, aggregation is an important operation to return statistical characterizations of subset of the data set. On massive data, approximate aggregation often is preferable for its better timeliness and responsiveness. This paper focuses on deterministic approximate aggregation to return running aggregate within progressive deterministic error interval. The existing methods either return approximate results with fixed accuracy, or return online approximate aggregate with probabilistic confidence interval, or incur a high I/O cost on massive data. This paper proposes LDA algorithm to compute deterministic approximate aggregate on massive data efficiently. LDA utilizes selection attribute lattice of hierarchical structure to distribute tuples and obtain a horizontal partitioning of the table. In each partition, each selection attribute is kept in column file and each ranking attribute is transposed to bit-slices. Given the selection condition, only relevant partitions are involved to compute the running aggregate. The compact storage scheme based on Z-order space filling curve is proposed to reduce the management cost of the partitions. An error reduction method is devised to reduce the error interval when computing running aggregate. The extensive experimental results on synthetic and real data sets show that LDA has a significant performance advantage over the existing algorithms."

abstract,"Abstract Causal inference from observational data is one of the most fundamental problems in science. In general, the task is to tell whether it is more likely that \(X\) caused \(Y\), or vice versa, given only data over their joint distribution. In this paper we propose a general inference framework based on Kolmogorov complexity, as well as a practical and computable instantiation based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Simply put, we propose causal inference by compression. That is, we infer that \(X\) is a likely cause of \(Y\) if we can better compress the data by first encoding \(X\), and then encoding \(Y\) given \(X\), than in the other direction. To show this works in practice, we propose Origo, an efficient method for inferring the causal direction from binary data. Origo employs the lossless Pack compressor and searches for that set of decision trees that encodes the data most succinctly. Importantly, it works directly on the data and does not require assumptions about neither distributions nor the type of causal relations. To evaluate Origo in practice, we provide extensive experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real-world data, including three case studies. Altogether, the experiments show that Origo reliably infers the correct causal direction on a wide range of settings."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a novel wrapper feature selection algorithm for classification problems, namely hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)- and extreme learning machine (ELM)-based feature selection algorithm (HGEFS). It utilizes GA to wrap ELM to search for the optimum subsets in the huge feature space, and then, a set of subsets are selected to make ensemble to improve the final prediction accuracy. To prevent GA from being trapped in the local optimum, we propose a novel and efficient mechanism specifically designed for feature selection problems to maintain GA’s diversity. To measure each subset’s quality fairly and efficiently, we adopt a modified ELM called error-minimized extreme learning machine (EM-ELM) which automatically determines an appropriate network architecture for each feature subsets. Moreover, EM-ELM has good generalization ability and extreme learning speed which allows us to perform wrapper feature selection processes in an affordable time. In other words, we simultaneously optimize feature subset and classifiers’ parameters. After finishing the search process of GA, to further promote the prediction accuracy and get a stable result, we select a set of EM-ELMs from the obtained population to make the final ensemble according to a specific ranking and selecting strategy. To verify the performance of HGEFS, empirical comparisons are carried out on different feature selection methods and HGEFS with benchmark datasets. The results reveal that HGEFS is a useful method for feature selection problems and always outperforms other algorithms in comparison."

abstract,"Abstract Patent retrieval primarily focuses on searching relevant legal documents with respect to a given query. Depending on the purposes of specific retrieval tasks, processes of patent retrieval may differ significantly. Given a patent application, it is challenging to determine its patentability, i.e., to decide whether a similar invention has been published. Therefore, it is more important to retrieve all possible relevant documents rather than only a small subset of patents from the top ranked results. However, patents are often lengthy and rich in technical terms. It is thus often requiring enormous human efforts to compare a given patent application with retrieved results. To this end, we propose an integrated framework, PatSearch, which automatically transforms the patent application into a reasonable and effective search query. The proposed framework first extracts representative yet distinguishable terms from a given application to generate an initial search query and then expands the query by combining content proximity with topic relevance. Further, a list of relevant patent documents will be retrieved based on the generated queries to provide enough information to assist patent analysts in making the patentability decision. Finally, a comparative summary is generated to assist patent analysts in quickly reviewing retrieved results related to the patent application. Extensive quantitative analysis and case studies on real-world patent documents demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

Using a formative research process to determine the needs of alternative certification teachers, we surveyed teachers in one school district to assess their coursework needs, preferences for course delivery methods, and requirements for state certification assessments to determine the feasibility of establishing a collaborative partnership between a college of education and a school district. Using descriptive statistics to analyze the results, respondents indicated the highest needs for credits in classroom management and educational assessment. Virtual courses were the preferred delivery method, and the majority of respondents indicated a preference for short summer courses. Finally, the majority of respondents indicated a need to pass the certification exam for professional education. Based on the results, the college of education and school district have needed information to establish a collaborative partnership to meet the needs of the teachers with alternative certification, ultimately impacting student learning."

abstract,"Abstract While community stakeholder engagement is becoming increasingly common in health care, operationalized training materials to support this learner population (community members) are scarce. Instructional design principles were used to create an Open Educational Resource (OER) to support the involvement of community stakeholders in health care research at a university health science center. Prior to the development of this project, a formal group, whose members named themselves Citizen Scientists (CSs), already existed to offer lay perspective on clinical and translational research studies. These CSs are involved in a wide range of active committees within the university’s college of medicine. The challenge of this program, however, is that the CSs require training to engage in these activities (e.g., reviewing research proposals). This design and development research case outlines the instructional design processes, and formative evaluation methods and results of the creation of an OER. While the description of the instructional design processes can be useful for similar project implementations, information on methods and results from the formative evaluation add the following benefits: (a) help community stakeholders to analyze whether projects’ goals have been met, (b) present project aspects that could be improved, and (c) support other communities by creating a model for project evaluation based on similar contexts and with similar project goals."

We also attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of several online chemistry courses taught with either hands-on kits or virtual laboratory activities, and examined the performance of students concurrently enrolled in lecture and laboratory chemistry courses versus those enrolled in a lecture only courses. The majority of survey respondents felt their online laboratory experience was the same as or better than their prior experiences in the traditional setting. Survey data also show that students believe their laboratory experiences reinforced and improved their understanding of concepts presented in lectures and the textbook, and thus may have helped them perform better on course assessments. Our data on performance suggest that students enrolled in online science courses do as well or better than their peers enrolled in traditional courses. The data also suggest that students who take lecture and laboratory concurrently outperform their lecture-only peers, independent of course (i.e., general or organic chemistry) or delivery method (i.e., online or traditional)."

Using data from 14 physics courses in a pre-university science program from winter 2013 to winter 2017 (N = 470), we sought to understand whether outcomes of formative assessment were related to the outcomes of summative assessment. The findings reveal a strong association between formative assessment (unit tests average) and summative assessment (final exam) and final grade, and indicate that the unit tests are strong predictors of final exam scores and final grades. However, there was only a significant, albeit small, effect between test 1 and final exam. While providing evidence that formative assessment techniques are a good indicator of how well students will perform overall, it is unclear that the unit tests contribute to improving student performance. Thus, unit tests alone appear insufficient to improve performance; students must also be provided with the means and the guidance to properly apply the feedback to improving their performance."

Based on a synthesis of four leading future learning spaces, a novel conceptualization is offered here to advance both scholarship and practice of future learning spaces. Specifically, this synthesis distinguishes between two types of spaces: content-flexible and content-specific. Content-flexible spaces are dedicated for instruction or open learning, while content-specific spaces are used as a stage for learning or as sources of content. In addition to this conceptualization, eight principles about the process of establishing future learning spaces and about specific features of their designs are provided based on interviews of lead designers of the four exemplars considered for this paper. The analysis of these principles shows that developmental principles are relatively fixed, while design principles have a wider range of diversity. These conclusions provide formative knowledge for designers of future learning spaces."

abstract,"Abstract Numerous instructional strategies have been applied to minimize statistics anxiety. Instructors are likely to consider those strategies a burden and may hesitate to apply them in their courses if there is a lack of continuous support. Open educational resources (OERs) enabled by information and communication technology have the potential to resolve this concern owing to their cost-effectiveness and to the prolific collections available. OERs can be adopted through reuse, redistribution, revision, and remix. Although a few former studies proved that technology could effectively reduce statistics anxiety, fewer studies demonstrated the effective adoption of OERs through reuse, redistribution, revision, and remix when coping with statistics anxiety. The purpose of this study was threefold. First, from earlier studies, we identified instructional strategies used to reduce statistics anxiety. Second, according to those instructional strategies, we assisted instructors in selecting and customizing OERs through reuse, redistribution, revision, and remix and in applying them in introductory statistics/quantitative research methodology courses. Third, we investigated the students’ perceptions of the use of OERs to reduce statistics anxiety. The findings indicated that students had a positive reaction to the use of OERs to reduce statistics anxiety. Through this study, we can establish a rigorous approach to adopting and customizing OERs for various instructional needs in an interdisciplinary curriculum."

history,"['2017-06', '2017-05-09']"
abstract,"Abstract Integrating console games into educational settings has been increasingly both applauded and criticized. The vast interest in game playing of people of all ages appears to be a motivating source for educators and trainers to find ways to effectively integrate serious games into their educational settings in order to inspire their own students towards the content they are providing in their classrooms. In the past few years, the surge in the interest in using mobile devices in the classroom has followed a similar track to that of console games, perhaps because their constructs appear to mirror those found in those console-based games. These similarities go beyond the coincidental fact that many of the most popular mobile apps also happen to follow game-like patterns. For this reason, the authors suggest that the need exists to examine the educational validity of the instructional apps that are being downloaded onto mobile devices using the same rationale that was previously extended in earlier studies. Using this premise, the researchers based their hypothesis that mobile apps can offer a unique and facile means to “gamify” a classroom. Based on a review of the current state of affairs in commercial off-the-shelf (OTS) apps, there may be too many on the market that profess to be “educational” when, in fact, they do little to actually support acquiring content knowledge. The authors suggest that this possible overabundance has contributed to the need to create a means for game designers to properly and accurately evaluate in a formative way what contributions their games would potentially make to education and training. The current study focuses both evaluating the value of using RETAIN for app designers to formatively assess their potential constructs and to inform educators as to which apps best meet the instructional and student learning needs once those apps enter the market."

abstract,"Abstract A Student Resource Center was created at a medium-sized public comprehensive university in the Mid-West as a solution to lack of technology competency in the student body. This Student Resource Center was designed to provide technology skill training in select technology tools in use by faculty, staff, and students. The ADDIE model was used to build a curriculum of technology skill training for the current student body based on data collected from surveys sent to university alumni, faculty, and students in addition to employers who hire a large number of university graduates. Participants were asked to identify the technology skills needed or learned during the time at the university and technology skills needed upon entering the work place. Results  of the study indicated that alumni and students felt they needed additional technology training and that employers found new hires generally lacking in technology competency."

abstract,"Abstract This formative research study used situated learning framework (Herrington & Oliver 2000) as the design theory to guide the transformation of an educational technology course for pre-service teachers. Data were collected from one question on 157 final exams over two semesters. The question prompted students to describe their course experience compared with the initial learning goal they had set for themselves, their perceptions of teaching with technology as a result of the course, and new learning goals they had as a result of the course. Student data indicates situated learning framework was effective in creating an authentic learning experience. Lessons learned from this design experience are shared to further the situated learning framework and for the benefit of other designers of educational technology classes for pre-service teachers."

abstract,"Abstract As we move further into the twenty-first century, businesses continue to seek employees with global experience and intercultural competence, but the reality is that many students are unable to gain this experience through study abroad programs for a variety of reasons. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is value in using web conferencing technology to provide students with access to international learning activities or ways to internationalize the curriculum for students who are unable to travel abroad. This formative case evaluation is the first in a series of iterative studies aimed at developing a viable, sustainable, technology-based solution through design-based research. The Online Learning Consortium’s (OLC) Quality Framework is composed of five pillars that support successful online learning: access, student satisfaction, faculty satisfaction, learning effectiveness, and scale (Online Learning Consortium 2017). Using the OLC Quality Framework, this formative case evaluation focuses on both quality (student satisfaction, faculty satisfaction, learning effectiveness) and value added (access, scale) when web conferencing technology was used to allow participants in the USA to participate live in study abroad activities in a global health management course in Brazil. Researchers found that web conferencing technology appears to be a viable alternative that provides its own set of benefits to students in higher education. Using the OLC Quality Framework to explore the evaluation questions revealed both success factors and areas for improvement in each of the five categories promoted by the international professional organization dedicated to the advancement of quality online learning."

The paper details the first mesocycle of an educational design research project (EDR) in which a robust theoretical framework was created to support the development of a 2-week series of robotics lessons. Analysis of evaluation data from 5 fifth-grade teachers and their students revealed that the integrative curriculum supported student problem solving and teacher practices that supported cognitive demand. Implications for research, design, and instruction are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract The discovery of a second genesis of life besides the one on Earth, this time on Mars, would have profound scientific and philosophical implications. Scientifically, it would provide a second example of biochemistry and of evolutionary history. Many important biological questions may be answerable through the comparison of biochemistry between the life forms on the two planets. Philosophically, the discovery of a second genesis of life in our solar system would suggest that the phenomenon of life is distributed throughout the universe. We could finally be confident that we are not alone. To protect a second genesis as we search for it, the robotic and human exploration of Mars should be done in a way that is biologically reversible, i.e., we must be able to undo our contamination of Mars if we discover a second genesis of life there. It is important to note that human exploration can be done in a way that is biologically reversible. Further, the discovery of a second genesis of life on Mars poses new questions in ethics. One question is: what ethical consideration is due to an alien life form when that life is distinctly different from Earth life, and the members of that life are no more advanced than microorganisms? Will we choose to terraform Mars to enhance the richness and diversity of the indigenous life we find there? In considering our answers to these questions, we should note that for most of Earth’s history our ancestors were microscopic."

abstract,"Abstract To understand the possible forms of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), we need not only astrobiology theories about how life evolves given habitable planets, but also evolutionary psychology theories about how intelligence emerges given life. Wherever intelligent organisms evolve, they are likely to face similar behavioral challenges in their physical and social worlds. The cognitive mechanisms that arise to meet these challenges may then be copied, repurposed, and shaped by further evolutionary selection to deal with more abstract, higher-level cognitive tasks such as conceptual reasoning, symbolic communication, and technological innovation, while retaining traces of the earlier adaptations for solving physical and social problems. These traces of evolutionary pathways may be leveraged to gain insight into the likely cognitive processes of ETIs. We demonstrate such analysis in the domain of search strategies and show its application in the domains of emotional aversions and social/sexual signaling. Knowing the likely evolutionary pathways to intelligence will help us to better search for and process any alien signals from the search for ETIs (SETI) and to assess the likely benefits, costs, and risks of humans actively messaging ETIs (METI)."

In doing so, this article traces the ways in which astrobiology employs scientific methodologies and engages with popular culture in ways that do four kinds of major work commonly found in origin myths: telling the origin story, demarcating the boundaries between self and the other, giving normative guidance, and declaring a shared societal purpose."

But in popular culture, “first contact” tends to be characterized as contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. This article will touch on theory and research relating to the origins and evolution of life and intelligence on Earth and speculation about extraterrestrial life and intelligence."

abstract,"Abstract Whatever we take “life” to mean, it must involve an attempt to describe the objective reality beyond scientists’ biases. Traditionally, this is thought to involve comparing our scientific categories to “natural kinds.” But this approach has been tainted with an implicit metaphysics, inherited from Aristotle, that does not fit biological reality. In particular, we must accept that biological categories will never be specifiable in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions or shared underlying physical structures that produce clean boundaries. Biology blurs all lines and failure to embrace this unique feature has blocked attempts to reach consensus on the meaning of “life.” Thus, while the three classical accounts (thermodynamic, metabolic, and evolutionary) all fall short of offering a complete definition, their advocates fail to realize that they share the same view of life’s ultimate, functional hallmark: its uniquely rich adaptive capacity. I develop an account of life as adaptive capacity that sidesteps debates about the relative importance of specific mechanisms and the precise location of boundaries to bring the three classical accounts together under a shared conceptual framework."

abstract,"Abstract Our understanding of the universe has grown rapidly in recent decades. We’ve discovered evidence of water in nearby planets, discovered planets outside our solar system, mapped the genomes of thousands of organisms, and probed the very origins and limits of life. The scientific perspective of life-as-it-could-be has expanded in part by research in astrobiology, synthetic biology, and artificial life. In the face of such scientific developments, we argue there is an ever-growing need for universal biology, life-as-it-must-be, the multidisciplinary study of non-contingent aspects of life as guided by biological theory and constrained by the universe. We present three distinct but connected ways of universalizing biology—with respect to characterizing aspects of life everywhere, with respect to the explanatory scope of biological theory, and with respect to extending biological insights to the structure of nonbiological entities. For each of these, we sketch the theoretical goals and challenges, as well as give examples of current research that might be labeled universal biology."

While the legal status of celestial bodies at the highest level is clear, uncertainty has arisen as to the extent private property rights over such objects or over their resources are legally acceptable, legally impossible, or potentially legal. This also provides for a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding how the legal framework could or may need to be changed to accommodate private interests. The article analyzes the two main international treaties relevant from this perspective, as well as their backgrounds, in order to outline the current legal status of celestial bodies and the resulting legal rights and obligations pertinent to both private exploitation and exploration. Based on such an analysis, it concludes by highlighting an approach that could actually incentivize the private sector and the science community to work together in a manner conducive to their interests in exploitation and exploration respectively."

Firstly, a theoretical paradigm is introduced, according to which animals show a natural propensity to maintain behavior far beyond the time when the triggering motivation has been removed;, these drifting conducts are defined as Vestigial Drifting Drives or (VDDs). Such a paradigm is then applied to those human attitudes that once conferred an adaptive advantage on our species but have now become dysfunctional within the framework of the current ecological crisis. In this context, human beings are considered the repository of VDDs that may play out as evolutionary threats. This thesis is supported by many examples and references that, hopefully, could stimulate scientific debate and further research in evolutionary anthropology, psychology, and related disciplines."

abstract,"Abstract Paul Griffiths and John Matthewson argue that selected effects play the key role in determining whether a state is pathological. In response, it is argued that a selected effects account faces a number of difficulties in light of modern genomic research. Firstly, a modern history approach to selection is problematic as a basis for assigning function to human traits in light of the small population sizes in the hominin lineage, which imply that selection has played a limited role in shaping these genomes in the evolutionarily recent past. Secondly, determining both the genetic basis of disease and selective histories of the various alleles involved may be experimentally intractable. Thirdly, the existence of “selected disorders” is well supported, and yet on the other hand many other common diseases may not reduce evolutionary fitness. In summary, the biological ends promoted by natural selection, as best modeled in recent research, do not adequately ground a concept of dysfunction that aligns well with the interests of human health."

abstract,"Abstract Contemporary philosophy of health and disease has been quite focused on the problem of determining the nature of the concepts of health and disease from a scientific point of view. Some theorists claim and argue that these concepts are value-free and descriptive in the same sense as the concepts of atoms, metal, and rain are value-free and descriptive. According to this descriptive or naturalist line of thought, the notions of health and disease are furthermore related to the idea of a normal or natural function. A bodily organ is healthy insofar as it functions normally, and it is diseased when it does not fulfill its functions. Other philosophers claim that the concept of health, together with other medical concepts, is essentially value-laden. To establish that a person is healthy does not just entail some objective inspection and measurement. It presupposes also an evaluation of the general state of the person. My purpose in this article is to scrutinize the relation between the notion of a natural function, on the one hand, and the concepts of health and disease on the other. In characterizing the notion of a normal function I will follow the classic analysis put forward by American philosopher Christopher Boorse. I will criticize Boorse’s proposal mainly by using arguments from the analysis of ordinary lay and medical language. I ask questions such as: what do we normally mean when we ascribe health or disease to a person? In the end I will recommend an analysis of these and related medical notions, which is unrelated to the notion of a natural function as normally interpreted."

abstract,"Abstract There is a conceptual crisis in the biomedical sciences that is particularly salient in psychopathology research. Underlying the crisis is a controversy that pertains to the current medical model of disease that largely draws from causal-mechanistic explanations. The bedrock of this model is the analysis of biological part-dysfunctions that aims at unequivocally defining a pathological condition and demarcating it from its neighboring entities. This endeavor has led to a quest for physiological, biochemical, and genetic signatures. Yet, so far there is little evidence for reliable biomarkers for any mental disorder. The contemporary biomedical paradigm largely ignores historical, dynamic, and system-level aspects—a view that has contributed much to the conceptual disjunction of the patient as a person from his/her disease. Notwithstanding the impressive progress in the biomedical sciences, increasingly more critics question whether the constituting framework is sufficient to convey a comprehensive understanding of illnesses, especially mental illnesses. Thus, the medical model urgently requires an update. But rather than revamping it by methodological advancements, it will be necessary to critically review its philosophical roots. The most problematic issues that require reworking are: the preponderance of the biostatistical theory; the undue decoupling of physiological from evolutionary explanations of function; the clinging to the Modern Synthesis (if etiological aspects are ever considered); and the neglect of dynamic and system-level properties. The proposed overhaul requires the heeding of historical explanations that draw from the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis as well as systems biology approaches for tackling multilevel and dynamic phenomena of complex systems."

abstract,"Abstract A biological function is supposed to be performed adequately, and hence may fail to do so: this is dysfunction. This raises two questions. One is how to make explicit the way in which function can be discriminated from dysfunction without confusing dysfunction with non-function. The second question is how what is “right” and “wrong” can be legitimated by natural regulatory norms. A function can be viewed as a quality to which at least one variable with a definite set of values is associated. Accordingly, function and dysfunction are the same quality of the same trait, but differ in the values associated to this variable. Dysfunction occurs when the associated set of values does not match this normal state. Biological systems have the epistemic singularity that their existence is the consequence of two distinct causal regimes, the so-called “proximate” and “ultimate” causes, whose convergence defines a system’s prescriptive normality. Each cause imposes restrictive rules that limit the possible ways these systems can putatively exist. When a system is insensitive to ultimate cause, it is determined by proximate causation alone, and hence escapes its own prescriptive norms. In conclusion: (1) The normality of a biological system is defined by the convergence of proximate and ultimate causes. (2) A function is a variable-associated quality whose values are defined relative to the norms of the system. (3) Dysfunction occurs when the set of values of the same variable does not match the normality of the system, which can occur when the system is insensitive to ultimate causation."

abstract,"Abstract Holobionts, consisting of a host and diverse microbial symbionts, function as distinct biological entities anatomically, metabolically, immunologically, and developmentally. Symbionts can be transmitted from parent to offspring by a variety of vertical and horizontal methods. Holobionts can be considered levels of selection in evolution because they are well-defined interactors, replicators/reproducers, and manifestors of adaptation. An initial mathematical model is presented to help understand how holobionts evolve. The model offered combines the processes of horizontal symbiont transfer, within-host symbiont proliferation, vertical symbiont transmission, and holobiont selection. The model offers equations for the population dynamics and evolution of holobionts whose hologenomes differ in gene copy number, not in allelic or loci identity. The model may readily be extended to include variation among holobionts in the gene identities of both symbionts and host."

abstract,"Abstract Synthetic biology offers a powerful method to design and construct biological devices for human purposes. Two prominent design methodologies are currently used. Rational design adapts the design methodology of traditional engineering sciences, such as mechanical engineering. Directed evolution, in contrast, models its design principles after natural evolution, as it attempts to design and improve systems by guiding them to evolve in a certain direction. Previous work has argued that the primary difference between these two is the way they treat variation: rational design attempts to suppress it, whilst direct evolution utilizes variation. I argue that this contrast is too simplistic, as it fails to distinguish different types of variation and different phases of design in synthetic biology. I outline three types of variation and show how they influence the construction of synthetic biological systems during the design process. Viewing the two design approaches with these more fine-grained distinctions provides a better understanding of the methodological differences and respective benefits of rational design and directed evolution, and clarifies the constraints and choices that the different design approaches must deal with."

The ethnographic study of the music of extant human foragers makes this quite apparent. Moreover, music is ancient. Sophisticated bird-bone and ivory flutes dated from 40 kya reveal an even earlier musical-technological tradition. So is music likely to be an entrenched feature of human social life during the long passage to behavioral modernity—say, by 150 kya—or earlier? In this article I sketch an evolutionary model that focuses on hominin vocal musicality and communication in the Pleistocene, tracking between series of phenotypes and changes in ecological, social, cognitive, and informational contexts. The model links musicality and protomusic to a bigger picture of hominin socio-cognitive evolution, making some connections clearer, motivating further theorizing and the search for new evidence."

In particular, the “Upper Paleolithic Transition”—an apparently abrupt increase in the complexity and disparity of our material culture—was thought to signal the arrival of the fully human mind. While the idea of a direct relationship between material complexity and cognitive sophistication still has some defenders, this view has largely been abandoned. It is now widely appreciated that aspects of ancient hominins’ demographic and social organization have a powerful influence both on the material culture they need and the material culture they can sustain. But if this more nuanced view is right (and I shall defend it), what does the deep material record tell us about the evolution of hominin cognition? I explore that question in this article."

These behaviors extend well beyond grief and must be cultivated deliberately by the survivors of the deceased individual. Those who are left behind have many ways of maintaining connections with their deceased, such as burials in places where the living are likely to return and visit. In this way, culturally defined places often serve as metaphors of social association and shared experience. Humans are the only kind of animal that buries their dead, and this gesture is preserved in Paleolithic sites as early as 120,000 years ago. Though not the only method of honoring the dead in human cultures, the emergence of burial traditions in the Middle Paleolithic (Mousterian) implies that both Neandertals and early anatomically modern humans (AMH) had already begun to conceive of the individual as unique and irreplaceable. Claims of primitive mortuary behavior in earlier periods than the Middle Paleolithic fall short in that they lack any signs of positive social-spatial associations between the deceased and survivors. The archaeological evidence for burial behavior in the Middle Paleolithic provides the first clear translation of mourning into a stereotypical action. These burials therefore may represent the first ritualized bridge between the living and the deceased in human evolutionary history."

abstract,"Abstract The social trackways theory (for full introduction see my previous article on the topic in Biological Theory) is centered on the remarkable 3.66 mya Laetoli Fossilized Trackways, for they incontrovertibly reveal our ancestors were already obligate bipeds with very human-like feet, and were intentionally stepping in other band members’ footprints to maintain safe footing. Trackways are unique among natural sign systems in possessing a depictive narratively generative structure, somewhat like the symbolic sign systems of gestural languages. Therefore, due to daily embodied reiteration of their own and other band member’s old footprints, both for bipedal safety and as recognizable wayfinding markers for socio-ecological navigation, incrementally our Mid-Pliocene ancestors began to acquire a cognitive capacity for episodic personal memories and episodic future simulations. They began mentally representing themselves (and others) as intentional agents continuously travelling from the past into the future. This spatially and temporally self-projecting awareness manifested itself as extra theory of mind and mental space-and-time-travel capacities, which increasingly enabled intentional or conscious, top-down executive adjustment of past behaviors for the sake of achieving better ways of doing things in the future. Future-directed behavioral and cultural adaptations began to increase fitness in all domains, thus creating powerful selective feedback for further entrenchment. Here we focus on overtly or consciously intentional exploratory wayfinding and transmission of elsewhere-and-when information, using pragmatic, discursive modes of communication, which enabled far more cooperative and efficient foraging practices. Selection for better communication thus led to intentional trail marking and the earliest emergence of more conventional/symbolic depictive and gestural “protolanguages.”"

abstract,"Abstract Communication in archaeological artifacts is usually understood in terms of signs or signals, fleshed out under many guises. The notions of signs or signals that archaeologists employ often draw from Saussurean or Peircean semiotic theories from philosophy and linguistics. In this article I consider the consequences of whether we understand archaeological signals in terms of the Saussurean or Peircean framework, and highlight the fact that archaeologists have not always been precise in their use of relevant philosophical machinery. I will argue further that interpretation of archaeological artifacts should be supplemented by a notion of meaning that goes beyond signals and leads us to understand meaning in terms of a specific creator’s communicative intention—which may deviate from how some signal was ordinarily used. This is what I call speaker meaning, drawing from philosophy of language. I then present specific examples from Egypt circa 1300 BC and 3500 BC and from France circa 12,000 BC that I argue are best treated with the proposed notion of speaker meaning. In the course of this discussion I consider questions that arise for current accounts of signals and metaphor in archaeology. Finally, I conclude by considering how my proposal relates to our understanding of decoration and style, humor, the advent of spoken language, and the nature of art."

I look at the application of this framework to enduring artifacts, including pictures, using indigenous rock art in Australia as a case study."

Then, using archaeological evidence pertaining to hominin lithic behavior from the early Pleistocene, I attempt to make plausible the idea that each of these cognitive abilities were in fact in place by this point in hominin evolutionary history and also that the requisite socio-ecological conditions were satisfied."

abstract,"Abstract While its mechanism and biological significance are unknown, the utility of a short mitochondrial DNA sequence as a “barcode” providing accurate species identification has revolutionized the classification of organisms. Since highest accuracy was achieved with recently diverged species, hopes were raised that barcodes would throw light on the speciation process. Indeed, a failure of a maternally donated, rapidly mutating, mitochondrial genome to coadapt its gene products with those of a paternally donated nuclear genome could result in developmental failure, thus creating a post-zygotic barrier leading to reproductive isolation and sympatric branching into independent species. However, the barcode itself encodes a highly conserved, species-invariant, protein, and the discriminatory power resides in the non-amino acid specific bases of synonymous codons. It is here shown how the latter could register changes in the oligonucleotide frequencies of nuclear DNA that, when they fail to match in pairing meiotic chromosomes, could reproductively isolate the parents (whose hybrid is sterile) so launching a primary divergence into two species. It is proposed that, while not itself contributing to speciation, the barcode sequence provides an index of the nuclear DNA oligonucleotide frequencies that drive speciation."

abstract,"Abstract Homology is a fundamental concept in biology. However, the metaphysical status of homology, especially whether a homolog is a part of an individual or a member of a natural kind, is still a matter of intense debate. The proponents of the individuality view of homology criticize the natural kind view of homology by pointing out that homologs are subject to evolutionary transformation, and natural kinds do not change in the evolutionary process. Conversely, some proponents of the natural kind view of homology argue that a homolog can be construed both as a part of an individual and a member of a natural kind. They adopt the Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) theory of natural kinds, and the theory seems to strongly support their construal. Note that this construal implies the acceptance of essentialism. However, looking back on the history of the concept of homology, we should not overlook the fact that the individuality view was proposed to reject the essentialist interpretation of homology. Moreover, the essentialist notions of natural kinds can, in our view, mislead biologists about the phenomena of homology. Consequently, we need a non-essentialist view of homology, which we name the “persistently reproducible module” (PRM) view. This view highlights both the individual-like and kind-like aspects of homologs while stripping down both essentialist and anti-essentialist interpretations of homology. In this article, we articulate the PRM view of homology and explain why it is recommended over the other two views."

abstract,"Abstract Despite the ubiquity of “levels of organization” in the scientific literature, a nascent “levels skepticism” now claims that the concept of levels is an inherently flawed, misleading, or otherwise inadequate notion for understanding how life scientists produce knowledge about the natural world. However, levels skeptics rely on the maligned “layer-cake” account of levels stemming from Oppenheim and Putnam’s defense of the unity of science for their critical commentary. Recourse to layer-cake levels is understandable, as it is arguably the default conception of levels in philosophy. However, relying on this conception of levels undermines the initial plausibility of general dismissals of the concept, because the problems skeptics identify within the “basic idea” of the concept “levels” are merely ones already widely acknowledged in this conception. I illustrate this “guilt by association” by looking at the embedded role of “levels” in articulating intertheoretical reductionism during the latter part of the 20th century. I conclude by suggesting a methodological framework focusing on local usage patterns as a promising means for future analysis of the levels concept."

Making use of the Osgood semantic differential, we presented the subjects with digital 3-D reproductions of the shell specimens to be subjectively evaluated according to 17 pairs of attributes. The results show that, overall, the subjective evaluations given by the subjects are consistent, which suggests that an intersubjective characterization of the shells as wholes according to their qualitative and morphological traits is possible and scientifically explicable. This may apply to other biological items as well. The results also show that the epithets given to the shells by taxonomists do not always reflect the perceptual evaluation of the general population, being a product of the well-known ambiguity in taxonomic categorization and naming."

We consider a model in which a population of agents are assortatively matched to play some asymmetric two-player game, and evolution operates at the level of behavior rules. We find that the relationship between the evolutionarily stable level of altruism and the index of assortativity of matching is determined by two novel features: (1) whether the total payoff function of the game exhibits complementarity or substitutability; (2) whether the two players’ strategies affect each other’s fitness in the same direction or the opposite. These two features combined generalize the stability conditions related to Hamilton’s rule to a class of asymmetric games."

abstract,"Abstract A new theory that naturalizes biological function is explained and compared with earlier etiological and causal role theories. Etiological (or selected effects) theories explain functions from how they are caused over their evolutionary history. Causal role theories analyze how functional mechanisms serve the current capacities of their containing system. The new proposal unifies the key notions of both kinds of theories, but goes beyond them by explaining how functions in an organism can exist as factors with autonomous causal efficacy. The goal-directedness and normativity of functions exist in this strict sense as well. The theory depends on an internal physiological or neural process that mimics an organism’s fitness, and modulates the organism’s variability accordingly. The structure of the internal process can be subdivided into subprocesses that monitor specific functions in an organism. The theory matches well with each intuition on a previously published list of intuited ideas about biological functions, including intuitions that have posed difficulties for other theories."

I argue that to restrict the extension of ecological science and its concepts in order to exclude cultivated plants, captive animals, and domesticated environments ecologists must appeal either (1) to the boundaries of their discipline; (2) to the idea that the effects of human activity are rare and unusual enough to count as ceteris paribus conditions; or (3) to the nature/culture divide. The boundaries of their discipline, however, are practical, not epistemological. The effects of human activity are ubiquitous and profound. And the nature/culture divide, as far as I know, has been infra dignitatem in the natural sciences at least since Charles Darwin and John Stuart Mill. Ecologists may reason, moreover, that organisms and systems that have the kind of history that interests them must as a result possess a kind of organization or some other general biological property that distinguishes them from those that do not. This is to commit a genetic fallacy."

More specifically, the strong version of this view would have it that ostensive communication was a prerequisite not just for the evolution of fully modern language but for any language-like system of communication. I argue that this version is too strong: I show how some distinctive and important features of language may well have been assembled prior to the evolution of ostensive communication. Put another way, I argue that a protolanguage before ostensive communication scenario is a real possibility. I conclude by briefly arguing that such an evolutionary scenario coheres better with archaeological evidence from the early Pleistocene as well as evidence from developmental psychology pertaining to the nature of our mind reading abilities."

abstract,"Abstract Criticism of big data has focused on showing that more is not necessarily better, in the sense that data may lose their value when taken out of context and aggregated together. The next step is to incorporate an awareness of pitfalls for aggregation into the design of data infrastructure and institutions. A common strategy minimizes aggregation errors by increasing the precision of our conventions for identifying and classifying data. As a counterpoint, we argue that there are pragmatic trade-offs between precision and ambiguity that are key to designing effective solutions for generating big data about biodiversity. We focus on the importance of theory-dependence as a source of ambiguity in taxonomic nomenclature and hence a persistent challenge for implementing a single, long-term solution to storing and accessing meaningful sets of biological specimens. We argue that ambiguity does have a positive role to play in scientific progress as a tool for efficiently symbolizing multiple aspects of taxa and mediating between conflicting hypotheses about their nature. Pursuing a deeper understanding of the trade-offs and synthesis of precision and ambiguity as virtues of scientific language and communication systems then offers a productive next step for realizing sound, big biodiversity data services."

Further on, I show how my interpretation relates to previous attempts to make sense of the notion of expected value in deterministic setups. The upshot of my analysis is a physical conception of drift that is compatible with both a deterministic and indeterministic world."

From modeling studies with computer-generated “biomorphs,” zoologist Richard Dawkins also affirmed Goldschmidt, proclaiming the “evolution of evolvability.” However, in the 1990s, while Gould and Dawkins were recanting, bioinformatic, biochemical, and cytological studies were providing a deeper underpinning. In 2001 this came under attack from leaders in the field who favored Dawkins’ genic emphasis. Now, with growing evidence for the uncoupling of speciation from adaptation, we can reinstate again Goldschmidt’s view and clarify its 19th-century roots."

abstract,"Abstract The fossil record shows that the stromatolites built by cyanobacteria 2 and 3 billion years ago are virtually identical to those built by their modern descendants, which is just a part of much evidence revealing that bacteria have barely changed in billions of years. They appeared very early in the history of life and have conserved their complexity (in terms of size, shape, and number of components) ever since. The eukaryotes, however, did the opposite. They repeatedly increased the complexity of their cells and eventually broke the cellular barrier and gave origin to all living creatures that we see around us. This gives us one of the major problems in evolution: why have the prokaryotes maintained the same complexity throughout the history of life while the eukaryotes have become increasingly more complex? Here it is shown that a solution does exist, but it is based on experimental data that so far have largely been ignored. It is based on the discovery that, in addition to the genetic code, many other organic codes exist in living systems. The potential to generate organic codes was already present in the common ancestor but was not transmitted indefinitely to all its descendants. After the genetic code and the signal transduction codes that gave origin to the first cells, the prokaryotes evolved no other organic code, whereas the ancestors of the eukaryotes continued to explore the coding space and gave origin to splicing codes, histone code, cytoskeleton codes, tubulin code, compartment codes, and sequence codes. This experimental fact suggests that the prokaryotes did not increase their complexity because they did not evolve new organic codes, whereas the eukaryotes became increasingly more complex because they maintained the potential to bring new codes into existence."

This article is intended to serve as both an analysis of and correction to those situations. Gould and Elisabeth Vrba’s terms, “exaptation” and “aptation,” as originally introduced, are very useful, unlike the faded adaptationist echo of “exaptation” devised by the methodological adaptationists, which has made the term incoherent. We will discuss how exaptation relates to function, to aptation, and to adaptation, both primary and secondary. These ideas have been rendered practically useless through their mistaken definitions and misapplications by evolutionary psychologists."

The mental image is the basic element of this procedure. The comparison of mental images is used to define recognition, and the identification and naming of macroscopic objects by a group of persons is formulated. This is shown to effect a binary relation of the order type on the set of objects that reduces to an equivalence relation in the case of observer independence."

This latter case is a situation in which the likelihood of a critical number of influential individuals of a coincident truth falls much more rapidly than a coincident untruth as the number of individual adherents to such unanimities rises. We term this phenomenon the collective misunderstanding syndrome (CMS), and it may explain rare collective behaviors such as the so-called ant mills."

abstract,"Abstract There have been several recent attempts to think about psychological kinds as homologies. Nevertheless, there are serious epistemic challenges for individuating homologous psychological kinds, or cognitive homologies. Some of these challenges are revealed when we look at competing claims of cognitive homology. This paper considers two competing homology claims that compare human anger with putative aggression systems of nonhuman animals. The competition between these hypotheses has been difficult to resolve in part because of what I call the boundary problem: boundaries between instances of psychological kinds (e.g., anger and fear) cannot be directly observed. Thus, there are distinctive difficulties for individuating psychological kinds across lineages. I draw four conclusions from this case study: First, recent evidence from the neuroscience of fear suggests that one of the proposed homologies involves a straightforward conflation of anger and fear. Second, this conflation arises because of the boundary problem. Third, there is an implicit constraint on the operational criteria that is easy to overlook in the psychological case. In this case, ignoring the constraint is part of the problem. Fourth, this is a clear case in which knowledge of homology cannot be accumulated piecemeal. Identifying homologs of human anger requires identifying homologs of fear."

We address a range of qualitative phenomena as observables of a psychological system seen as an impredicative system. The starting point of our study is the notion that perceptual phenomena are projections of underlying invariants, objects that remain unchanged when transformations of a certain class under consideration are applied. The study develops with the observables, the entailed total order and metric, whence the algebra and the geometry of such a science, presenting a formal phenomenological model for phenomena that are not rigidly Euclidean. We show how non-Euclidean perception can have many useful (non-rigid) Euclidean formalizations, as well as locally-homeomorphic-to-Euclidean-space models. The mathematical models we provide are tested on the basis of results from experimental psychology, in particular from the field of color, time, and space perception."

abstract,"Abstract The “Baldwin effect” occurs when natural selection supplements adaptive phenotypic changes acquired during an organism’s lifetime. This effect, first described in 1896, is now usually considered to be rare and insignificant, and is not part of the explanatory repertoire of most evolutionary scientists. Arguments against it are examined here and found to be inadequate, either because they misunderstand the effect, or confuse it with Lamarckism, or fail to perceive it even while describing it. The article proposes examples showing that the Baldwin effect is far more prevalent and powerful than even Baldwin’s few supporters realize. Evolved features of the human mind are described that make this effect unusually difficult to perceive. Some of these mental features are themselves Baldwin effects. Natural selection’s supporters, and its skeptics, appear to disregard the Baldwin effect for different reasons. The article proposes that acceptance of the Baldwin effect can significantly improve the study of human nature, as practiced by both sides in the nature-nurture controversy, and can even provide a bridge to end this controversy."

abstract,"Abstract In contrast to the two X chromosomes that participate equally in oogenic meiosis in mammals, during spermatogenesis the solitary X chromosome can be regarded as an inadequate pairing partner for the Y chromosome. Hence it is epigenetically silenced and consigned to the XY body. This silenced state can transfer between generations. The sleeping X will awake when in a female cell with an accompanying maternally donated X chromosome (a homologous DNA duplex). Transgene experiments in nematodes indicate that a similar process can operate at the level of chromosomal segments. A gene that mispairs at meiosis is epigenetically silenced and transferred to the next generation where its awakening is conditional on the presence of a meiotic pairing partner. These intergenerational transfers of epigenetic labelling, and intragenerational reversals thereof, might apply at the level of individual bases when confronted with inadequate pairing partners. During meiotic recombination, homologous DNA sequences of maternal and paternal origin pair to form a mutual duplex, and mismatches can be detected and corrected (gene conversion). But there is only a 50 % chance that the correction will favor a particular allele. There is information that a DNA duplex segment is in need of correction, but not how correction could asymmetrically favor one allele (generally the wild-type). If the segment were epigenetically marked as “suspect,” this information could be used in a future generation to favorably correct should more information, in the form of a homologous unmutated duplex, became available. So fundamental would this mechanism be that it would have provided a selection pressure for the emergence of epigenetic marking early in evolution."

abstract,"Abstract In this article, I present a substantive proposal about the timing and nature of the final stage of the evolution of full human language, the transition from so-called “protolanguage” to language, and on the origins of a simple protolanguage with structure and displaced reference; a proposal that depends on the idea that the initial expansion of communicative powers in our lineage involved a much expanded role for gesture and mime. But though it defends a substantive proposal, the article also (perhaps more importantly) defends and illustrates a methodological proposal too. I argue that language is a special case of a more general phenomenon—cumulative cultural evolution—and while we rarely have direct information about communication, we have more direct information about the cumulative cultural evolution of technical skill, ecological strategies, and social complexity. These same factors also enable us to make a reasonable estimate of the intergenerational social learning capacities of these communities (on which rich communication depends) and of the communicative demands these communities face. For example, we can, at least tentatively, identify forms of cooperation that are stable only if third party information is transmitted widely, cheaply, and accurately. So we can use these more direct markers of information accumulation to locate, in broad terms, the period in our evolutionary history during which we became lingual."

abstract,"Abstract Numerous groups race to discover the gene biomarker whose alteration alone is indicative of a particular disease in all humans. Biomarkers are selected from the most frequently altered genes in large population cohorts. However, thousands of other genes are simultaneously affected, and, in each person, the same disease results from a unique, never-repeatable combination of gene alterations. Therefore, our Genomic Fabric Paradigm (GFP) switches the focus from the alteration of one particular gene to the overall change in selected groups of functionally related genes. Biomarkers are of little therapeutic value, their high alterability indicating low protection by the homeostatic mechanisms as for minor players. Instead of these most alterable genes in all patients, GFP identifies in each patient the genes whose highly protected expression governs major functional pathways by controlling the expression of numerous other genes. Smart manipulation of such (commander) genes would have the maximum therapeutic benefit not for everybody but for the treated person. The genomic fabric is defined as the transcriptome associated with the most interconnected and stably expressed network of genes responsible for a particular functional pathway. The fabric exhibits specificity with respect to race/strain, sex, age, tissue/cell type, and lifestyle and environmental factors. It remodels during development, progression of a disease, and in response to external stimuli. GFP is powered by mathematically advanced analytical tools whose application is illustrated by reprocessing data from previously published gene expression experiments."

abstract,"Abstract According to the species-as-individuals thesis (hereafter S-A-I), species are cohesive entities. Barker and Wilson recently pointed out that the type of cohesion exhibited by species is fundamentally different from that of organisms (paradigmatic individuals), suggesting that species are homeostatic property cluster kinds. In this article, I propose a shift in how to approach cohesion in the context of S-A-I: instead of analyzing the different types of cohesion and questioning whether species have them, I focus on the role played by cohesion in the identity of individuals. This shift allows us to recognize why cohesion matters to S-A-I, as well as to reconceive the analogy between species and organisms (paradigmatic individuals), and also allows us to highlight the context sensitivity of both “cohesion” and “individuals.” From this perspective, I identify two problems in Barker and Wilson’s argumentation. Firstly, the authors fail to recognize that species are individuals even if they do not have the same type of cohesion that organisms have. Secondly, their argument relies on a misinterpretation of S-A-I. I conclude that species cohesion is still best framed as a feature of species individuality rather than a feature of species as homeostatic property cluster kinds. The arguments presented here contribute to the re-articulation and reevaluation of S-A-I in the face of contemporary discussions."

abstract,"Abstract Darwin’s theory predicts that linguistic behavior gradually evolved out of animal forms of communication (signaling). However, this prediction is confronted by the conceptual problem that there is an essential difference between signaling and linguistic behavior: using words is a normative practice. It is argued that we can resolve this problem if we (1) note that language evolution is the outcome of an evolutionary transition, and (2) observe that the use of words evolves during ontogenesis out of babbling. It is discussed that language evolved as the result of an expansion of the vocalizing powers of our ancestors. This involved an increase in the volitional control of our speech apparatus (leading to the ability to produce new combinations of vowels and consonants), but also the evolution of socially guided learning. It resulted in unique human abilities, namely doing things with words and later reasoning and giving reasons."

abstract,"Abstract Radiation science is dominated by a paradigm based on an assumption without empirical foundation. Known as the linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis, it holds that all ionizing radiation is harmful no matter how low the dose or dose rate. Epidemiological studies that claim to confirm LNT either neglect experimental and/or observational discoveries at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels, or mention them only to distort or dismiss them. The appearance of validity in these studies rests on circular reasoning, cherry picking, faulty experimental design, and/or misleading inferences from weak statistical evidence. In contrast, studies based on biological discoveries demonstrate the reality of hormesis: the stimulation of biological responses that defend the organism against damage from environmental agents. Normal metabolic processes are far more damaging than all but the most extreme exposures to radiation. However, evolution has provided all extant plants and animals with defenses that repair such damage or remove the damaged cells, conferring on the organism even greater ability to defend against subsequent damage. Editors of medical journals now admit that perhaps half of the scientific literature may be untrue. Radiation science falls into that category. Belief in LNT informs the practice of radiology, radiation regulatory policies, and popular culture through the media. The result is mass radiophobia and harmful outcomes, including forced relocations of populations near nuclear power plant accidents, reluctance to avail oneself of needed medical imaging studies, and aversion to nuclear energy—all unwarranted and all harmful to millions of people."

abstract,"Abstract In “Some Criticism of the Contextual Approach, and a Few Proposals” in Biological Theory, Brian McLoone discusses some of the points about the contextual approach that I made in a recent paper. Besides offering a reply to McLoone’s comments on my paper, in this article I show why McLoone’s discussion of the two main frameworks for thinking about group selection—the contextual and the Price approach—is partly misguided. In particular, I show that one of McLoone’s main arguments against the contextual approach is missing the target and that one of his (and Elliott Sober’s) arguments in defense of the Price approach is flawed. Criticizing these arguments will help me present an entirely different picture than McLoone’s of the current status of multilevel selection theory. More precisely, I argue that the idea that we are dealing with “multilevel selection” in the type of multigroup cases in which the focal units are the individuals (and their traits) has recently come under threat. Finally, I discuss the ways in which this idea might be salvaged by appealing either to the contextual or to the Price approach."

abstract,"Abstract The phylogenetic trees reconstructed from molecular data have led to the discovery that all living creatures belong to three primary kingdoms, or domains, because there are three types of cells in nature. The primary kingdoms are referred to as Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaya, and their first representatives were the first modern cells that appeared on Earth. All known cells, on the other hand, contain a virtually universal genetic code, and this implies that the code evolved in a population of primitive systems that preceded the first modern cells and is collectively known as the common ancestor of all life. This gives us the problem of understanding how the descendants of the common ancestor gave origin to the first modern cells. In this article it is argued that the appearance of the genetic code allowed the ancestral systems to translate genes into specific proteins, but their behavior was still ambiguous because they were unable to produce specific responses to the signals from the environment. To that purpose they needed to evolve signal processing codes, and here it is proposed that the development of these codes was a crucial step in the evolution of the first modern cells."

In this article, some conceptual analyses and clarification of terms in the conditions for its application (density relative to resources as a variable with spatial, temporal, and niche boundaries fixed), and in the explanantia of the theory (costs and frequencies, stability and instability within and among growing and declining populations, multiple levels of selection, and ultimately homogeneous and patchy environments) are presented. These make intelligible plausible mechanisms (consumption and digestion, production, and reproduction) linking the explanantia and the explananda of the theory that are both theoretically coherent and clarify what predictions it does not and does make including about senescence."

To begin with, we are urged to reject the received Cartesian-Laplacean myths: Descartes’ certainty and Laplace’s computational omniscience. Instead, Wimsatt re-engineers a philosophy for human beings with all their cognitive limitations. His approaches find their starting point in the actual practices of scientists themselves, which he strongly identifies with engineering practices as the source of researchers’ solutions for dealing with a complex world. He aims to construct an understanding of scientific methodology around the central role of reduction. But he dismisses eliminative reductionism in favor of a heuristic-based realist view. Wimsatt’s world is a complex one, and this means that science needs to do away with all the absolute and simple answers, because they do not reflect the world we are living in. A complex world requires the mindset and tinkering of an engineer to uncover its reality. The appropriate response must be heuristics all the way down as we constantly seek out reliable inferences on often shifting ground. To this end, we aim for models and theories that are robust, just as engineers aim to build robust machines. And although errors occur and approaches are fallible, they allow us to continually adapt the heuristics applied and sharpen our perceptions so as to develop more refined tools for investigating and understanding the world."

However, the article proposes something similar to Nagel’s neutral monism by positing a hierarchy of information processes that spans the domains of matter, life, and mind. As depicted in this hierarchy, subjective experience is emergent, but also continuous with informational phenomena at lower levels."

Then, I discuss the advantages of his thesis, and especially the emphasis on the organism as the subject rather than the object of evolution.

abstract,"Abstract The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein chose as his prime exemplar of certainty the fact that the skulls of normal people are filled with neural tissue, not sawdust. In 1980 the British pediatrician John Lorber reported that some normal adults, apparently cured of childhood hydrocephaly, had no more than 5 % of the volume of normal brain tissue. While initially disbelieved, Lorber’s observations have since been independently confirmed by clinicians in France and Brazil. Thus Wittgenstein’s certainty has become uncertain. Furthermore, the paradox that the human brain’s information content (memory) appears to exceed the storage capacity of even normal-sized brains, requires resolution. This article is one of a series on disparities between brain size and its assumed information content, as seen in cases of savant syndrome, microcephaly, and hydrocephaly, and with special reference to the Victorian era views of Conan Doyle, Samuel Butler, and Darwin’s research associate, George Romanes. The articles argue that, albeit unlikely, the scope of explanations must not exclude extracorporeal information storage."

abstract,"Abstract Evidence shows that knowledge concerning medicinal plants is heterogeneous, as the majority of people in a medical system know only a few plants. This heterogeneity may make sense from an adaptive viewpoint, as human beings tend to keep a small set of information that offers adaptive advantages because our brains can store limited amounts of data. From this scenario, we developed the structural core concept for medical systems: a group of medicinal plants with adaptive characteristics that affect the structure and function of medical systems. We created a set of hypotheses based on the structural core concept to guide future studies investigating the structure and dynamics of local medical systems. Concerning the dynamics of medical systems, we suggest that the structural core is the part of the system that changes least over time, i.e., it is the most conservative. Thus, we can expect that species substitution events mainly occur outside of the structural core. From the medical system structure, we indicate that core plants tend to be favored in the transmission of knowledge. These plants also serve as a model for the selection of novel medicinal plants and are therefore an important factor for the medical system structure. Analysis of the structural core can help the understanding of the structure and dynamics of medical systems and can aid future bioprospecting studies, which can search for plants with pharmacological potential using the structural core."

abstract,"Abstract The cumulative open-endedness of human cultures represents a major break with the social traditions of nonhuman species. As traditions are altered and the modifications retained along the cultural lineage, human populations are capable of producing complex traits that no individual could have figured out on its own. For cultures to produce increasingly complex traditions, improvements and modifications must be kept for the next generations to build upon. High-fidelity transmission would thus act as a ratchet, retaining modifications and allowing the historical buildup of complex traditions. Mechanisms acting against slippage are important, of course, but cultures also need to move forward for the ratchet to retain anything important. In this article, I argue that studies of modification-generating processes and the many ways they shape cumulative culture have been overlooked. Key to a better understanding of cultural modification processes is taking seriously that cultural traditions consist of complex, hierarchically structured recipes. Taking such structures seriously and assessing the different ways they can vary in cultural design space, a novel picture for the onset of cumulative cultural evolution emerges. I argue that a possible impediment for cumulative culture in nonhuman animals may in fact reside not so much in the fidelity of their social transmission but rather in the constraints, internal and external, on their capacity to modify complex, hierarchically structured cultural recipes."

The debate surrounding the evolution of altruism has generally focused on the conditions under which altruism can evolve and whether it is better explained by kin selection or multilevel selection. This debate has occupied the forefront of the stage and left behind a number of equally important questions. One of them, which is the subject of this article, is whether the word “selection” in “kin selection” and “multilevel selection” necessarily refers to “evolution by natural selection.” I show, using a simple individual-centered model, that once clear conditions for natural selection and altruism are specified, one can distinguish two kinds of evolution of altruism, only one of which corresponds to the evolution of altruism by natural selection, the other resulting from other evolutionary processes."

abstract,"Abstract There are currently three major theories on the origin and evolution of the genetic code: the stereochemical theory, the coevolution theory, and the error-minimization theory. The first two assume that the genetic code originated respectively from chemical affinities and from metabolic relationships between codons and amino acids. The error-minimization theory maintains that in primitive systems the apparatus of protein synthesis was extremely prone to errors, and postulates that the genetic code evolved in order to minimize the deleterious effects of the translation errors. This article describes a fourth theory which starts from the hypothesis that the ancestral genetic code was ambiguous and proposes that its evolution took place with a mechanism that systematically reduced its ambiguity and eventually removed it altogether. This proposal is distinct from the stereochemical and the coevolution theories because they do not contemplate any ambiguity in the genetic code, and it is distinct from the error-minimization theory because ambiguity-reduction is fundamentally different from error-minimization. The concept of ambiguity-reduction has been repeatedly mentioned in the scientific literature, but so far it has remained only an abstract possibility because no model has been proposed for its mechanism. Such a model is described in the present article and may be the first step in a new approach to the study of the evolution of the genetic code."

abstract,"Abstract The species problem is often described as the abundance of conflicting definitions of species, such as the biological species concept and phylogenetic species concepts. But biologists understand the notion of species in a non-definitional as well as a definitional way. In this article I argue that when they understand species without a definition in their mind, their understanding is often mediated by the notion of good species, or prototypical species, as the idea of “prototype” is explicated in cognitive psychology. This distinction helps us make sense of several puzzling phenomena regarding biologists’ dealing with species, such as the fact that in everyday research biologists often behave as if the species problem is solved, while they should be fully aware that it is not. I also briefly discuss implications of this finding, including that some extant attempts to answer what the nature of species is have an inadequate assumption about how the notion of species is represented in biologists’ minds."

Lewontin, to present problems such as the disappearance of evidence, the mishandling of the null hypothesis, and failures in scientific reasoning, exemplified by a case from human behavioral ecology. In conclusion the paper shows that “methodological adaptationism” does not deserve its benign reputation."

But not all fields of science are lucky enough to be able to achieve these features. And when they are not, nonetheless to force the phenomena studied to be characterized largely with numbers and the causal mechanisms to be described mathematically can court seriously limiting and distorting the field of study. Research by economists on long-run economic development is an example of a field of research where this has happened. But unfortunately the phenomena are widespread throughout science."

abstract,"Abstract Complexity in our universe, Herbert Simon once noted, generally takes a hierarchical, nearly decomposable form. If our purpose as biologists is to ""carve Nature at the joints,"" then the quantitative biologist's pattern questions must embody some tentative claim of where the explanatory joints are—only after meaningful qualifications can notions of variance and covariance make sense. In morphometrics, specimens and variables alike can be ""carved at the joints,"" with a correspondingly great gain in explanatory power in both versions. Simon's advice is that the competent biologist's measurements should lie entirely within a single organismal component or else deal entirely with one of the joints. In either context, our best contemporary rhetorics of explanation in biology may resemble morphometrics in their frank combination of carefully (i.e., qualitatively) supervised parallel quantifications that, taken together, result in new qualifications, leading in turn to new quantifications, and so on. In short, the relation between qualitative and quantitative in the organismal biological sciences is not an opposition but a complementarity, and the modern biometrical statistics of organismal form may be a particularly apposite praxis for exploring it."

abstract,"Abstract Biological sciences have strived to adopt the conceptual framework of physics and have become increasingly quantitatively oriented, aiming to refute the assertion that biology appears unquantifiable, unpredictable, and messy. But despite all effort, biology is characterized by a paucity of quantitative statements with universal applications. Nonetheless, many biological disciplines—most notably molecular biology—have experienced an ascendancy over the last 50 years. The underlying core concepts and ideas permeate and inform many neighboring disciplines. This surprising success is probably not so much attributable to mathematical and statistical approaches in molecular biology, but rather to the preponderance of qualitative approaches, especially visualization. Visualizations can be afforded by quantitative research, but usually they rely on both, quantitative and qualitative research. I claim the following three features to be responsible for the unceasing zeal for using visualizations: (1) visual representations facilitate reasoning, (2) images can be cognitively processed in a “fast” manner, and (3) abstractions of visual representations prompt conceptual advances. In summary, visualizations have largely contributed to the success of molecular biology by conveying its concepts to other disciplines, and at the same time, eclipsing mere quantitative approaches. However, visualizations also bear the risk of misinterpretation when traversing neighboring disciplines and even more so when pervading nonscientific domains."

abstract,"Abstract Suspicion of “physics envy” surrounds the standard statistical toolbox used in the empirical sciences, from biology to psychology. Mainstream methods in these fields, various lines of criticism point out, often fall short of the basic requirements of measurement. Quantitative scales are applied to variables that can hardly be treated as measurable magnitudes, like preferences or happiness; hypotheses are tested by comparing data with conventional significance thresholds that hardly mention effect sizes. This article discusses what I call (with tongue in cheek) “shmeasurement.” To “shmeasure” is to fail to apply quantitative tools to quantitative questions. We “shmeasure” when we try to measure what cannot be measured, or, conversely, when we ask binary questions of continuous measurements. Following the critics of standard statistical tools, it is argued that our statistical toolbox is indeed less concerned with the measurement of magnitudes than we take it to be. This article adds, however, that measurement is not all there is to scientific activity. Most techniques of proof do not resemble measurement as much as voting—a practice that makes frequent use of numbers, figures, or measurements, yet is not chiefly concerned with assessing quantities. Measurement is only one among three functions of the scientific toolbox, the other two being collating observations and deciding which hypotheses to relinquish. I thus make a plea for “shmeasurement”: the mismeasure of things starts to make more sense once we take into account the nonquantitative side of scientific practice."

abstract,"Abstract The apparent dichotomy between qualitative versus quantitative dimensions in science intersects with the domain of several disciplines, as well as different research fields within one and the same discipline. The perception of qualitative as “poor quantitative,” however, is methodologically unsustainable, because there are perfectly rigorous ways to conduct qualitative research. A somehow different question is whether a science of qualities per se is possible: that is, whether a science of appearances can be devised, what its observables are, and its methodological implications. The article deals with this last issue, and especially from the point of view of experimental phenomenology. The weakness of the current approach to perception is discussed, and an alternative view that goes beyond veridicalism is presented. The analysis tackles crucial issues such as color and spatial appearances, the qualitative dimension of perceived depth, and the role of visual meaningful gestalten as information tools for the survival of living beings in the environment. If developed, a science of the qualitative dimensions of appearances may contribute to revising the ecological theory of perception by making its natural semantics more explicit."

The right combination depends on the complexity of the slice of reality that we wish to understand in each case.

On one side, quantitative measurement produced the widely used IQ test but shed little light on the construct of intelligence and its role in human cognition. On the other side, reductive quantification and experimental constraints limited the investigation and understanding of human memory systems and complex learning throughout the first century of the field’s history. Recent research under fewer constraints has made greater progress in these areas."

Human judgment, it seems, is flawed by the tendency to overestimate the magnitude of rare but evocative risks, while underestimating risks associated with commonplace dangers. Such findings are particularly relevant to the problem of crafting responsible public policy in the face of the kinds of threat posed by climate change. If the risk perception of ordinary citizens cannot be trusted, then it would seem logical to base policy decisions on expert judgment. But how rational, how trustworthy, are expert assessments of catastrophic risk? I briefly review the limitations of conventional models of expert risk analysis, especially in dealing with the large uncertainties endemic to the risk of low-probability, high-impact events in the distant future. The challenges such events pose to the underlying assumptions of these analyses are severe enough to question their basic rationality. I argue that a conception of rationality premised on the bounded knowledge of experts and lay citizens alike, based on context-appropriate heuristics, may help us in the search for a more trustworthy basis for
 decision making."

abstract,"Abstract Throughout the years a lively debate has flourished around niche construction theory. A source of contention has been the distinction between narrow and broad construction activities proposed by critics. Narrow construction is limited to the production of evolutionarily advantageous artifacts while broad construction refers to construction activities that have an impact on the ecosystem but offer little or negative adaptive feedback to the organisms. The first has been acknowledged as relevant to evolutionary studies in that it increases species’ fitness and it is genetically inherited, while the second has been dismissed as accessory and irrelevant. I argue this distinction is unsatisfactory and leads to misinterpreting the achievements of niche construction theory. Instead I propose a three-tier categorization of constructionism (literal, analogical, and figurative) based on the analysis of the metaphor of construction itself. I show metaphors are not a mere rhetorical device but represent an instrument through which theories evolve and introduce new elements. In fact through this categorization I will be able to highlight two innovative features of constructionism: the introduction of reciprocal causation as a main causal framework and the expansion of studies about evolution to large frameworks involving multiple levels of biological organization. I will show their role in each of the three kinds of construction in order to offer a better understanding of the distinctive features of the niche construction approach. The innovations introduced encourage the revision of the concepts of adaptation and enlarge the range of phenomena to be considered relevant in biological studies."

abstract,"Abstract Although there are many historical and philosophical analyses of evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo), its development in the 1980s, when many individual or collective attempts to synthesize evolution and development were made, has not been examined in detail. This article focuses on some interdisciplinary studies during the 1980s and argues that they had important characteristics that previous historical and philosophical work has not recognized. First, we clarify how each set of studies from the 1980s integrated the results or approaches from different biological fields, such as paleontology, developmental genetics, comparative morphology, experimental embryology, theoretical developmental biology, and population genetics. Second, after close examination we show that the interdisciplinary studies during the 1980s adopted different and conflicting views of genes, such as developmental-genetic, epigenetic, or population-genetic ones. We conclude that EvoDevo in the 1980s was a motley aggregation of various kinds of local integration. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis by comparing these early EvoDevo studies with those of the Modern Synthesis and with the present state of EvoDevo."

abstract,"Abstract Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis have argued that individual-selection accounts of human cooperation flounder in the face of the free-rider identification problem. Kim Sterelny has responded to this line of argument for group selection, arguing that the free-rider identification problem in fact poses no theoretical difficulty for individual-selection accounts. In this article, I set out to clarify Bowles and Gintis’ argument. As I see matters, the real crux of their argument is this: solving the free-rider identification problem, even in modestly sized social groups, requires that group members are disposed to share social information with one another. The difficulty for individual-selection accounts, according to Bowles and Gintis, is that these accounts have no explanation for why individuals should be disposed to behave in this way. Having clarified their argument, I then turn to Sterelny’s criticism, and argue that Sterelny underestimates the challenge being raised by Bowles and Gintis. More specifically, I argue that it is unclear whether the expected benefits of having a disposition to share social information would have outweighed the expected costs for an individual belonging to a Pleistocene social group. Importantly, this is not to say that I am persuaded by Bowles and Gintis’ argument; on the contrary, what I claim is that more theoretical (and in particular) empirical work is necessary before the issues under discussion can be settled. I formulate some specific questions which I think future research in this area should aim to address."

Functional explanations describe mechanisms, whereas evolutionary explanations provide answers to the question “why?” mostly by appealing to the past and present action of natural selection. But the relations between these two types of explanations, as well as the relative insights they offer, vary from one domain of research to another. We will illustrate this complex landscape of biological explanations with three examples involving aging, the sex ratio, and the phenomenon of genomic imprinting. We will show that the two types of explanations have recently often progressed towards each other. In consequence, they cease to be “pure” functional or evolutionary explanations and become explanations that may be alternatively considered as functional or evolutionary."

Then, I discuss problematic entailments the contextual approach has for what processes count as group selection—entailments more troublesome than typically noted. However, Sober and Wilson’s version of the Price approach, which is the main alternative to the contextual approach, is problematic too: it leads to an underappreciated paradox called the vanishing selection problem and thereby generates the wrong qualitative account of whether group selection is occurring in a certain family of cases. In response, I develop an account of group selection that can deal with the counterexamples to both the contextual approach and the Price approach. I then discuss the role that contextual analysis can continue to play in the discussion of individual fitness and metapopulation evolution."

abstract,"Abstract F. A. Hayek’s The Sensory Order (1952) is often considered to be a theory of cognitive psychology. While it contains a theory on the psychology of perception, it has the function of illustrating Hayek’s solution to the mind–body problem. The solution, which has been strongly influenced by Moritz Schlick’s epistemology, takes the form of a physicalist identity theory. An attempt is made to trace Schlick’s influence on Hayek to the latter’s stay in Zürich, which resulted in a manuscript (1920) that contains the main features of the 1952 book. One of the consequences of Hayek’s theory is that we cannot describe the functioning of our mind completely without using expressions that refer to subjective experiences. For Hayek this is not a fundamental problem but a practical one that does not jeopardize his physicalist identity theory. Unlike the manuscript, The Sensory Order contains a rudimentary sketch of an evolutionary research program. When Hayek elaborated that program later, though, he focused on cultural evolution rather than on the evolution of the mind."

Central to this debate has been whether selective pressures affecting group success can trump the selective pressures that confer advantage at the individual level. In short, there has been a debate about the utility of group selection, with noted theorist Steven Pinker calling the concept useless for the social sciences. We surveyed 175 evolutionary anthropologists to ascertain where they stood in the debate. We found that most were receptive to group selection, especially in the case of cultural group selection. The survey also revealed that liberals and conservatives, and males and females, all displayed significant differences of opinion concerning which selective forces were important in humanity’s prehistory. We conclude by interpreting these findings in the context of recent research in political psychology."

These tensions appear because of different modeling approaches, diverse explanatory aims and strategies, and divergent views about the scope of the evolutionary synthesis. We locate these discussions in the context of long-running philosophical deliberations on explanation, modeling, and theoretical synthesis. We show how many of the issues central to ESB’s progress can be understood as general philosophical problems. The benefits of addressing these philosophical issues feed back into philosophy too, because ESB provides excellent examples of scientific practice for the development of philosophy of science and philosophy of biology."

This can potentially shed light on some of the changes that paved the way for the evolution of distinctively human behavioral capacities such as language, advanced social cognition, and elaborate forms of tool craft. In this light, I revisit several widely known—but also widely misunderstood—cases of exceptional animals and argue that each of these cases provides clues about key innovations in our own evolutionary history."

abstract,"Abstract In a recent opinion piece, Denis Duboule has claimed that the increasing shift towards systems biology is driving evolutionary and developmental biology apart, and that a true reunification of these two disciplines within the framework of evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo) may easily take another 100 years. He identifies methodological, epistemological, and social differences as causes for this supposed separation. Our article provides a contrasting view. We argue that Duboule’s prediction is based on a one-sided understanding of systems biology as a science that is only interested in functional, not evolutionary, aspects of biological processes. Instead, we propose a research program for an evolutionary systems biology, which is based on local exploration of the configuration space in evolving developmental systems. We call this approach—which is based on reverse engineering, simulation, and mathematical analysis—the natural history of configuration space. We discuss a number of illustrative examples that demonstrate the past success of local exploration, as opposed to global mapping, in different biological contexts. We argue that this pragmatic mode of inquiry can be extended and applied to the mathematical analysis of the developmental repertoire and evolutionary potential of evolving developmental mechanisms and that evolutionary systems biology so conceived provides a pragmatic epistemological framework for the EvoDevo synthesis."

abstract,"Abstract Evolutionary systems biology (ESB) aims to integrate methods from systems biology and evolutionary biology to go beyond the current limitations in both fields. This article clarifies some conceptual difficulties of this integration project, and shows how they can be overcome. The main challenge we consider involves the integration of evolutionary biology with developmental dynamics, illustrated with two examples. First, we examine historical tensions between efforts to define general evolutionary principles and articulation of detailed mechanistic explanations of specific traits. Next, these tensions are further clarified by considering a recent case from another field focused on developmental dynamics: stem cell biology. In the stem cell case, incompatible explanatory aims block integration. Experimental approaches aim at mechanistic explanation while dynamical system models offer explanation in terms of general principles. We then discuss an ESB case in which integration succeeds: search for general attractors using a dynamical systems framework synergizes with the experimental search for detailed mechanisms. Contrasts between the positive and negative cases suggest general lessons for achieving an integrated understanding of developmental and evolutionary dynamics. The key integrative move is to acknowledge two complementary aims, both relevant to explanation: identifying the space of possible dynamic states and trajectories, and mechanistic understanding of causal interactions underlying a specific phenomenon of interest. These two aims can support one another in a joint project characterizing dynamic aspects of evolving lineages. This more inclusive project can lead to insights that cannot be reached by either approach in isolation."

abstract,"Abstract The role of the arts has become crucial to understanding the origins of “modern human behavior,” but continues to be highly controversial as it is not always clear why the arts evolved and persisted. This issue is often addressed by appealing to adaptive biological explanations. However, we will argue that the arts have evolved culturally rather than biologically, exploiting biological adaptations rather than extending them. In order to support this line of inquiry, evidence from a number of disciplines will be presented showing how the relationship between the arts, evolution, and adaptation can be better understood by regarding cultural transmission as an important second inheritance system. This will allow an alternative proposal to be formulated as to the proper place of the arts in human evolution. However, in order for the role of the arts to be fully addressed, the relationship of culture to genes and adaptation will be explored. Based on an assessment of the cognitive, biological, and cultural aspects of the arts, and their close relationship with ritual and associated activities, we will conclude with the null hypothesis that the arts evolved as a necessary but nonfunctional concomitant of other traits that cannot currently be refuted."

abstract,"Abstract Biologists frequently draw on ideas and terminology from engineering. Evolutionary systems biology—with its circuits, switches, and signal processing—is no exception. In parallel with the frequent links drawn between biology and engineering, there is ongoing criticism against this cross-fertilization, using the argument that over-simplistic metaphors from engineering are likely to mislead us as engineering is fundamentally different from biology. In this article, we clarify and reconfigure the link between biology and engineering, presenting it in a more favorable light. We do so by, first, arguing that critics operate with a narrow and incorrect notion of how engineering actually works, and of what the reliance on ideas from engineering entails. Second, we diagnose and diffuse one significant source of concern about appeals to engineering, namely that they are inherently and problematically metaphorical. We suggest that there is plenty of fertile ground left for a continued, healthy relationship between engineering and biology."

abstract,"Abstract Recently, there has been a growing interest, both within theoretical biology and the philosophy of biology, in the possibility and desirability of a theory of development. Among the many issues raised within this debate, the questions of the spatial and temporal boundaries of development have received particular attention. In this article, noting that so far the discussion has mostly centered on the processes of morphogenesis and organogenesis, we argue that an important missing element in the equation, namely the development of language and cognition in general, may play an important role in settling the issue of temporal boundaries. After examining the idea that the development of language, cognition, and action are bona fide biological processes, we explore the consequences for a general theory of development of taking them into consideration."

abstract,"Abstract Many marine invertebrates have the ability to combine tissues with conspecifics and form chimeras. This ability is usually accompanied by the presence of a polymorphic self/non-self recognition system (allorecognition) that allows integration of closely related individuals, but blocks interactions between those more distantly related. The presence of a discriminatory allorecognition system suggests that there are costs and benefits to chimerism that are correlated to relatedness, but the nature of these costs and benefits is still poorly understood. Interestingly, allorecognition is found throughout the animal kingdom, with examples in nearly all the multicellular phyla; however, the role of allorecognition in these different species is not always clear. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying allorecognition in different species are not related, suggesting a unique origin for each species. This brings up the question as to whether there is a universal need for self/non-self recognition processes among the metazoa, or if these systems evolve in response to different selective pressures. We are studying allorecognition and chimerism in the colonial ascidian, Botryllus schlosseri. Allorecognition takes place at the tips of the extracorporeal vasculature, and can result in a parabiosis (fusion), or a rejection reaction that blocks vascular fusion. Fusion has both hypothesized benefits as well as well-documented costs. This article will focus on characterizing the costs and benefits of fusion and chimerism in Botryllus, and put them into the broader context of the role of allorecognition in the metazoa."

Then, the specificities of the individuality in the sense of this weak concept are examined in ecology; I conclude by addressing the differences between ecosystems and organisms as they appear in the viewpoint of such concept."

abstract,"Abstract Information plays an important role not only in evolution—genetics can be seen as a mechanism to transfer information from one generation to the next—but also in ecology: virtually all organisms use information about their environment to adjust their behavior and life histories. Indeed, being adapted to something can be defined as having the right information to solve the life-history problems that this creates. It then becomes irrelevant precisely where this information came from (genetics, experience, culture, etc.) but rather becomes an issue of how to assess the fitness value of this information. Here I will explore in some detail the conceptual consequences of the information-based view of evolution. In particular, I will focus on how individuals are actually associations of smaller units that depend on each other’s genetic information and on information from multiple external sources. An important and fundamental problem arises when these different sources of information do not suggest the same adaptations. Conflicting information may thus give new insight into the causes of stress."

abstract,"Abstract In this article, I will discuss possible differences between ecosystems and organisms on the basis of their intrinsic complexity. As the concept of complexity still remains highly debated, I propose here a practical and original way to measure the complexity of an ecosystem or an organism. For this purpose, I suggest using the concept of logical depth (LD) in a specific manner, in order to take into account the difficulty as well as the time needed to generate the studied object. I illustrate this method with fully controlled Daisyworld simulations (i.e., simulations based on the Gaia hypothesis) that have often been proposed to mimic living systems. The method consists of the following sequential stages: (1) identification of the shortest program able to numerically model the studied system (also called the Kolmogorov–Solomonoff complexity); (2) running the program, once if there are no stochastic components in the system, several times if stochastic components are there; and (3) computing the time needed to generate the system with LD complexity. This measure is supposed to estimate the system complexity. It appears in this study that LD estimations fit well with the intuition we have of complex systems, with higher complexities being found for more realistic Daisyworlds. With such a method of capturing the time needed to build a system, we expect to detect in future studies any quantified differences between complex ecosystems and organisms."

They might be thought of as analogous to Aristotelian physics. Second-order models describe the population dynamics as being indirectly affected, the ecological factors now affecting the derivative of the growth rate (that is, the population acceleration), possibly through an impact on nongenetically inherited factors. Second-order models might be thought of as analogous to Galilean physics. In a companion article, we apply these ideas to a situation of gene therapy."

abstract,"Abstract Research on the human microbiome has generated a staggering amount of sequence data, revealing variation in microbial diversity at the community, species (or phylotype), and genomic levels. In order to make this complexity more manageable and easier to interpret, new units—the metagenome, core microbiome, and enterotype—have been introduced in the scientific literature. Here, I argue that analytical tools and exploratory statistical methods, coupled with a translational imperative, are the primary drivers of this new ontology. By reducing the dimensionality of variation in the human microbiome, these new units render it more tractable and easier to interpret, and hence serve an important heuristic role. Nonetheless, there are several reasons to be cautious about these new categories prematurely “hardening” into natural units: a lack of constraints on what can be sequenced metagenomically, freedom of choice in taxonomic level in defining a “core microbiome,” typological framing of some of the concepts, and possible reification of statistical constructs. Finally, lessons from the Human Genome Project have led to a translational imperative: a drive to derive results from the exploration of microbiome variation that can help to articulate the emerging paradigm of personalized genomic medicine (PGM). There is a tension between the typologizing inherent in much of this research and the personal in PGM."

This article looks for a concept of individuality that would hold at the same time for organisms and for communities or ecosystems, the latter being unaffected by natural selection (as it is usually contended). In the wake of Simon’s notion of “quasi-independence,” I elaborate a concept of “weak individuality” defined by probabilistic connections between sub-entities, read off our knowledge of their interactions. This formal scheme of connections allows one to infer what are the individuals in the domain addressed by the theory of the interactions. The article argues that if ecosystems do not have strong individuality (in the sense of natural-selection-based individuality), they still possess a weak individuality, ecological theories providing the values of the variables in the formula for individuality."

We show that depending on the order chosen for the model (a choice that cannot be made on a priori assumptions), different kinds of dynamics are expected, possibly leading to different therapeutic strategies. This drives us to discuss several features of the extension of ecology to intraorganismal ecology."

abstract,"Abstract Adaptations can occur at different hierarchical levels (e.g., cells and multicellular organisms), but it can be difficult to identify the level(s) of adaptation in specific cases. A major problem is that selection at a lower level can filter up, creating the illusion of selection at a higher level. We use optimality modeling of the volvocine algae to explore the emergence of genuine group (i.e., colony-level) adaptations. We find that it is helpful to develop an explicit model for what group fitness would be in the absence of group-level relationships between traits and group fitness. We call this “counterfactual fitness,” because in many actual cases of interest there are group-level relationships. Once counterfactual fitness is modeled, the difference between effects that filter up and genuine group selection is explicit and so, therefore, is the distinction between apparent and genuine group adaptations. We call the latter group-specific adaptations. Recognizing group-specific adaptations is important because only group-specific adaptations would cause the lower-level units (cells in this case) to be maladapted if they were to leave the group and enter a global cell-level population. Thus, as group-specific adaptations evolve, they create selective pressure for increased cohesiveness and individuality of groups. This article suggests that group-specific adaptations could be present in the simplest, earliest branching colonial volvocine species, which do not have distinct specialized cells. The article also makes predictions about the kind of empirical evidence needed to support or refute the hypothesis that a particular trait is a group-level adaptation."

abstract,"Abstract Building upon a non-standard understanding of evolutionary process focusing on variation and persistence, I will argue that communities and ecosystems can evolve by natural selection as emergent individuals. Evolutionary biology has relied ever increasingly on the modeling of population dynamics. Most have taken for granted that we all agree on what is a population. Recent work has reexamined this perceived consensus. I will argue that there are good reasons to restrict the term “population” to collections of monophyletically related replicators and interactors, which explains why many existing models in population biology exclude by definition many genuine evolving biological individuals such as communities and ecosystems. By studying a case of community evolution (a symbiotic termite–fungus community), we will see that it is variation that is important to evolutionary processes, not populations. Variation within a population is only one of many types of variation that can lead to evolution by natural selection. The upshot of focusing on variation is that cases of community and ecosystem adaptive change become tractable in evolutionary terms. I will show that complex emergent individuals such as communities and ecosystems cannot be fully accommodated by conventional population/reproduction models but can be accommodated by variation/persistence models."

I express this trade-off in a modified form of Hamilton’s rule, where I distinguish between the real and perceived cost of an altruistic act, and between the real and perceived genetic relatedness between colony members. Furthermore, I elaborate how the vertebrate neuromodulator oxytocin could serve as an internal representation of the perceived cost of an altruistic act and of perceived relatedness. Behavioral and receptor localization data support this hypothesis. The encoding of cost and relatedness by oxytocin is likely integrated with a number of other functions related to social bonding. I conclude with a discussion of honesty in signaling, an outline of testable consequences of this hypothesis, and a comparison between vertebrate and insect eusociality."

We see ourselves forced to qualify three central assumptions of the the ‘disorders-as-windows’ hypothesis. After discussing the main outcome of decades of research on the linguistic ontogeny of pathological populations, we argue that language disorders should be construed as conditions for which canalization has failed to cope fully with developmental perturbations. We conclude that a robust link exists between developmental disturbances and evolutionary history that allows language disorders to be used as real windows onto the evolution of the neuronal substrate of language, and emphasize that our conclusion is more compatible with views of language evolution as the result of reorganizational changes as opposed to radically novel emergences."

abstract,"Abstract This article is divided into two main sections. The first discusses “Female Inheritance and the Male Retention Hypothesis.” Permanent groups (groups with no inherent limit on group longevity) exist in several species because over generations members share important interests. Considering the association between cooperation and degree of relatedness, it seems to follow that a collective interest is more likely to be achieved when members show a higher degree of relatedness. I argue that if membership is inherited by only one sex, and this is the female sex, this results in a higher degree of relatedness between group members than when membership is inherited by both sexes, or by males only. Indeed, this is found in the overwhelming majority of species of insects, fish, birds, and mammals living in permanent groups. The (few) exceptions to the rule are briefly discussed. Humans are of special interest because human preindustrial societies tend to show either male or female inheritance. The second section asks, “Do Moralizing Gods Raise Paternity Confidence?” Since males inherit valuable membership in patrilocal/lineal societies, they are expected to be more concerned about the probability of paternity than males in matrilocal/lineal societies. Moral rules, and specifically belief in moralizing gods, are expected to reflect this difference. An analysis of cross-cultural data of preindustrial societies does not refute the hypothesis that moralizing gods are more often found in patrilocal/lineal societies, nor is this hypothesis unambiguously supported."

Fisher, in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, outlined in detail how eusociality could evolve, and developed a verbal model by connecting selection on fecundity with the sterility of workers. Fisher saw social insect colonies as harmonious units, in contrast to human societies that exhibit intra-communal conflict. Fisher’s development of the model was strongly influenced by his correspondence with Leonard Darwin, and so I call it the Fisher-Darwin model. However, Fisher was not influenced by Lamarckian views on the evolution of social insects that were common at that time. The Fisher-Darwin model presages almost exactly the mathematical model recently proposed by Nowak and colleagues."

A close study of Darwin’s treatment of ethics that situates it among the ethical concepts and principles of the above normative theories is interesting, and helpful and necessary as today we seek to understand ethics against the backdrop of an evolutionary perspective on human beings. Ethics and human nature are distinct, yet theories of ethics always come with an attendant view of human nature. The moral philosophers Aristotle, Aquinas, Hobbes, Kant, and Mill—who provide important forerunners of normative theories on offer today—view human beings differently: their ethical theories have distinctive contours because of the particular aspects of human beings they regard as most significant. The same is true of Darwin; yet Darwin’s evolutionary view of human beings, though admittedly quite unique among traditional moral theorists, does not lead him to an unfamiliar and eccentric view about the nature and content of ethics."

The cells metabolic activity was assessed at varying CBZ concentrations (~ 10–25 ppm, pure CBZ) and cumulatively for ozone transformation products. For pure CBZ, % cell viability decreases as CBZ concentration increases, while, in case of post-ozonated CBZ transformation products, the viability decreases initially and then increases upon exposure of ozone with a maximum cell viability of 97 ± 2.8% evaluated for 2 h post-ozonated samples."

Using a checkerboard assay, the combinations of doxycycline and imipenem, doxycycline and ceftazidime, and doxycycline and amoxicillin–clavulanate tested against four strains showed indifferent effects with summation fractional inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.62 to 2.12. Time-kill experiments also indicated that the combinations of doxycycline/β-lactam antibiotics against four tested strains did not fulfil synergy criteria, in which all combinations showed indifferent effects with − 1.36 to 1.26-log CFU/mL compared to the most active monotherapy regimen in each combination. No re-growth of bacteria was detected after the early killing in doxycycline/β-lactam combination regimens compared to β-lactam monotherapy regimens, in which 9 out of 10 were associated with re-growth of bacteria. As no synergistic activity was observed, this in vitro study showed that doxycycline offers no additional benefit to be used in combination with β-lactams in the intensive phase of therapy."

Mycobacterium sp. BRS2A-AR2 was isolated from the aerial roots of the mangrove plant Rhizophora racemosa. The Mycobacterium was demonstrated for the first time ever to produce AuNPs with sizes that range between 5 and 55 nm. The highest level absorbance of the biosynthesized AuNPs was typical for actinobacterial strains (2.881 at 545 nm).

Significant vibration stretches were seen at 3314, 2358, 1635 and 667 cm−1 in FT-IR spectra. This demonstrated the possible use of small aliphatic compounds containing –COOH, –OH, –Cl and –NH2 functional groups in the stabilization of the AuNPs. The effect of the biosynthesized AuNPs on HUVEC and HeLA cell lines was measured at 48 h.

abstract,"Abstract 
Bacterial persisters (defined as dormant, non-dividing cells with globally reduced metabolism) are the major cause of recurrent infections. As they neither grow nor die in presence of antibiotics, it is difficult to eradicate these cells using antibiotics, even at higher concentrations. Reports of metabolites (which help in waking up of these inactive cells) enabled eradication of bacterial persistence by aminoglycosides, suggest the new potential strategy to improve antibiotic therapy. Here we propose, mannitol enabled elimination of Salmonella persister cells by the nisin–antibiotic combination. For this, persister cells were developed and characterized for their typical properties such as non-replicative state and metabolic dormancy. Different carbon sources viz. glucose, glycerol, and mannitol were used, each as an adjunct to ampicillin for the eradication of persister cells. The maximum (but not complete) killing was observed with mannitol–ampicillin, out of all the combinations used. However, significant elimination (about 78%) could be observed, when nisin (an antimicrobial peptide) was used with ampicillin in presence of mannitol, which might have mediated the transfer of antibiotic–nisin combination at the same time when the cells tried to grab the carbon molecule. Further, the effectiveness of the trio was confirmed by flow cytometry. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of this trio-combination for developing it as an option for tackling Salmonella persister cells."

The pathogenicity of the isolates was individually assessed in the greenhouse by inoculating wheat plants with spore suspensions. Ten of the 21 isolates caused significantly higher incidences of black point than that the controls. These isolates belonged to eight fungal species (A. alternata, B. sorokiniana, B. crotonis, B. cynodontis, C. spicifera, F. equiseti, E. rostratum, and E. sorghinum) based on morphological traits and phylogenetic analysis. The average incidences of black point in the eight fungal species were 32.4, 54.3, 43.0, 41.9, 37.2, 38.8, 50.1, and 34.1%, respectively. B. sorokiniana and A. alternata were determined to be the most important pathogens in the North China Plain based on fungal prevalence and symptom severity. This study is the first to identify E. rostratum as a major pathogen causing black point in wheat."

abstract,"Abstract The health beneficial attributes of bifidobacteria and its safe association with the host gut has increased its significance as a probiotic. However delivering probiotic bifidobacteria with Minimum Biological Value (MBV) through product has always been a challenge. In the present study, an attempt was made to maintain the viability of native isolate of Bifidobacterium longum CFR 815j and deliver through ice-cream. B. longum CFR815j was microencapsulated in alginate starch capsules by emulsification followed by evaluation of bead stability in simulated gastrointestinal conditions. After incorporation in ice-cream, the effect on chemical properties, sensory parameters and meltdown characteristics of the product were also evaluated. Survival studies of B. longum revealed higher counts than 107 in the product which is essential for probiotic bacteria to exhibit beneficial effect. Further, all the properties of this ice-cream were comparable to the regular ice-cream. Our studies conclude that encapsulation was able to maintain the requisite MBV of bifidobacteria in ice-cream without affecting the sensory characteristics."

abstract,"Abstract Antibiotic resistant features of Acinetobacter baumannii is partly due to the decreased outer membrane proteins (OMPs) permeability. The OmpA is one of the most conserved proteins among A. baumannii with a considerable antigenic potential to stimulate the multidimensional immune system responses. The present study was aimed to clone the ompA gene into the eukaryotic expression vector with potential as DNA vaccine. The ompA gene of A. baumannii was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The target DNA was cloned and sub-cloned into the pTZ57R/T and pBudCE4.1 vectors, respectively. The recombinant vectors containing ompA were then validated using colony PCR, vector sequencing and double-digestion strategies. The pBudCE4.1–ompA recombinant plasmid was transfected into the human dermal fibroblast cells (HDF) and presence of ompA transcript and protein was evaluated using reverse transcribed-PCR (RT-PCR) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Our finding from colony PCR, sequencing and enzyme double digestion result confirmed that target gene has been successfully inserted into the pTZ57RT and pBudCE4.1. The presence of an expected band (1112 bp) in RT-PCR as wells as a ~ 38 kDa band during SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant pBudCE4.1–ompA construct was efficiently transfected into the HDF cells and expressed. Altogether, our observation demonstrated that the recombinant pBudCE4.1–ompA construct was successfully produced although further experiments are needed."

abstract,"Abstract Bacillus sp. strain MA04 a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) showed hemolytic activity on blood agar plates, and the supernatant from liquid culture in nutrient broth at 24 h exhibited emulsification activity, suggesting the production of biosurfactants. In antagonist assays, the supernatant showed antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi such as Penicillium expansum, Fusarium stilboides, Sclerotium rolfsii y Rhizoctonia solani, finding a reduction of mycelial growth of all fungi tested, ranging from 35 to 69%, this activity was increased with time of culture, accomplishing percentages of inhibition up to 85% with supernatants obtained at 72 h. Then, the crude biorsurfactant (CB) was isolated from the supernatant in order to assay its antagonistic effect on the phytopathogens previously tested, finding an increase in the inhibition up to 97% at 500 mg/L of CB. The composition of CB was determined by infrared spectroscopy, identifying various functional groups related to lipopeptides, which were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF–MS, revealing a mixture of fengycins A and B whose high antifungal activity is been widely recognized. These results show that PGPR Bacillus sp. MA04 could also contribute to plant health status through the production of metabolites with antimicrobial activity."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of farnesol on the production of acids and hydrolytic enzymes by biofilms of Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. The present study also evaluated the time-kill curve and the effect of farnesol on matrix composition and structure of single-species and dual-species biofilms. Farnesol, at subinhibitory concentrations, showed a significant reduction in S. mutans biofilm acid production, but did not alter C. albicans hydrolytic enzyme production. The number of cultivable cells of both microorganisms was significantly reduced after 8 h of contact with farnesol. Extracellular matrix protein content was reduced for biofilms formed in the presence of farnesol. In addition, confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy displayed structural alterations in all biofilms treated with farnesol, which included reduction in viable cells and extracellular matrix. In conclusion, farnesol showed favorable properties controlling some virulence factors of S. mutans and C. albicans biofilms. These findings should stimulate further studies using this quorum-sensing molecule, combined with other drugs, to prevent or treat biofilm-associated oral diseases."

abstract,"Abstract Metarhizium rileyi (Farlow) Samson is an important entomopathogenic fungus of more than 30 species of Lepidoptera larvae. The aim of this research was to characterize isolate of M. rileyi from Quivicán, Cuba on the basis of morphological and molecular approaches. The fungus was isolated from samples of S. frugiperda larvae collected from maize fields of Quivicán municipality, Mayabeque province, Cuba, and it was cultured on PDA + Ampicillin solid media for morphological characterization. The DNA was isolated using CTAB method and internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, ITS4) were used as the primers for the amplification. The amplified products of 1335 bp were purified and sequenced at CINVESTAV-IPN in both the directions using the above primers. A consensus sequence was obtained by alignment of the forward and reverse sequences for this region and deposited in GenBank (MG637450). The fungus produced slightly cottony colony of pale green color and dispersed conidia and septal mycelium were observed under the optical microscope. A BLAST search of the sequence in GenBank revealed a 99% of identity with several strains of N. rileyi (e.g., AF368501.1, AB268359.1 and EU553337.1) and M. rileyi (e.g., KY436756.1). This is the first report of M. rileyi isolate from maize fields of Quivicán in Cuba and this is important for biodiversity studies and is another possibility for Integrated Pest Management."

abstract,"Abstract Incubation with microbial culture supernatants improved essential oil yield from Aquilaria subintegra woodchips. The harvested woodchips were incubated with de man, rogosa and sharpe (MRS) agar, yeast mold (YM) agar medium and six different microbial culture supernatants obtained from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and S. cerevisiae prior to hydrodistillation. Incubation with lactic acid bacteria supernatants provided higher yield of agarwood oil (0.45% w/w) than that obtained from yeast (0.25% w/w), agar media (0.23% w/w) and water (0.22% w/w). The composition of agarwood oil from all media and microbial supernatant incubations was investigated by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Overall, three major volatile profiles were obtained, which corresponded to water soaking (control), as well as, both YM and MRS media, lactic acid bacteria, and yeast supernatant incubations. Sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives were key components of agarwood oil. Fifty-two volatile components were tentatively identified in all samples. Beta-agarofuran, α-eudesmol, karanone, α-agarofuran and agarospirol were major components present in most of the incubated samples, while S. cerevisiae-incubated A. subintegra provided higher amount of phenyl acetaldehyde. Microbial culture supernatant incubation numerically provided the highest yield of agarwood oil compared to water soaking traditional method, possibly resulting from activity of extracellular enzymes produced by the microbes. Incubation of agarwood with lactic acid bacteria supernatant significantly enhanced oil yields without changing volatile profile/composition of agarwood essential oil, thus this is a promising method for future use."

abstract,"Abstract The adaptive process in bacteria is driven by specific genetic elements which regulate phenotypic characteristics such as tolerance to high metal ion concentrations and the secretion of protective biofilms. Extreme environments such as those associated with heavy metal pollution and extremes of acidity offer opportunities to study the adaptive mechanisms of microorganisms. This study focused on the genome analysis of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt MCMY1), a gram positive rod shaped bacterium isolated from an acid mine drainage site in Sabah, Malaysia by using a combination of Single Molecule Real Time DNA Sequencing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The genome size of Bt MCMY1 was determined to be 5,458,152 bases which was encoded on a single chromosome. Analysis of the genome revealed genes associated with resistance to Copper, Mercury, Arsenic, Cobalt, Zinc, Cadmium and Aluminum. Evidence from SEM and FTIR indicated that the bacterial colonies form distinct films which bear the signature of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and this finding was supported by the genome data indicating the presence of a genetic pathway associated with the biosynthesis of PHAs. This is the first report of a Bacillus sp. isolated from an acid mine drainage site in Sabah, Malaysia and the genome sequence will provide insights into the manner in which B. thuringiensis adapts to acid mine drainage."

Sphingobacterium kitahiroshimense was first reported from Japan and was isolated from the city of Kitahiroshima, Hokkaido, Japan. In this report we have discussed about the origin of our strain and predicted that air masses and dust associated microbial cells transportation phenomena may be applicable for the origin of this species in this region. Enzymes and secondary metabolites secreted by the genus Sphingobacterium have enormous potentiality regarding their biotechnological application. Preliminary study of our strain based on metabolic profiling through HPLC showed many new metabolites were secreted by the bacterium when grown in presence of different sugar medium at 28 °C. As far as our knowledge this is the first report about Sphingobacterium species isolated from this region. This preliminary finding will help to draw an idea about the bacterial population in this Himalayan Glaciers (in HP) as well as biotechnological application of this strain can be explored further."

abstract,"Abstract Chromium (Cr) released from industrial units such as tanneries, textile and electroplating industries is detrimental to the surrounding ecosystems and human health. The focus of the present study was to check the Cr(VI) removal efficiency by marine-derived fungi from liquid broth.

Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed aggregation of mycelial biomass with exopolysaccharide, while Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy showed the presence of Cr2O3 inside the biomass indicating presence of active Cr(VI) removal mechanisms. This was further supported when the Cr(VI) removal was monitored using DPC (1,5-diphenylcarbazide) method. The results of this study point to the potential of marine-derived fungal isolates for Cr(VI) removal."

It also shows how the sequence can be used to mine the enzymes and construction of its 3-dimensional structure so that its functional behavior can be predicted and compared. The discriminating algorithm allows analysis of the promoter region and provides the insight in the regulation of genes in spite of the similarity in its sequences. The ecological niche specific bacterial behavior and adapted altered physiology can be understood through the presence of secondary metabolite, antibiotic resistance genes, and viral genes; and it helps in the valorization of genetic information for developing new biological application/processes.

abstract,"Abstract Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease and is driven by strong type 2 immune responses. Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 (NS8), a probiotic strain isolated from Mongolian koumiss, has anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of NS8 on AD-like skin lesions by using SKH-1 hairless mice that underwent three cycles of epicutaneous sensitization (EC) with ovalbumin (OVA). NS8 (5 × 108 CFU/day) was orally administered to mice from 2 weeks before the first sensitization until the end of the study. NS8 attenuated the symptoms and pathological changes in the skin of AD mice. For example, NS8 reduced epidermal and dermal thickening and significantly restrained the infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils, and CD4+ T cells into the dermis. By analysing the Th1/Th2 cytokines produced in skin lesions, we found that NS8 significantly suppressed the expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (P < 0.05), while it had no discernible effect on the expression of IFN-γ. Systemically, NS-8 reduced the total IgE and OVA-specific IgE levels in serum (P < 0.05). Our study demonstrates that oral administration of L. helveticus NS8 effectively alleviates AD severity in mice by suppressing the Th2 immune response. NS8 may be a promising candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of allergic diseases, such as AD.

abstract,"Abstract Green silver nanoparticle (AgNP) biosynthesis is facilitated by the enzyme mediated reduction of Ag ions by plants, fungi and bacteria. The antimicrobial activity of green AgNPs is useful to overcome the challenge of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial properties of biosynthesized AgNPs depend on multiple factors including culture conditions and the microbial source. The antimicrobial activity of AgNPs biosynthesized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Acinetobacter baumannii (confirmed clinical isolate) were investigated in this study. Biosynthesis conditions (AgNO3 concentration, pH, incubation temperature and incubation time) were optimized to obtain the maximum AgNP yield. Presence of AgNPs was confirmed by observing a characteristic UV–Visible absorbance peak in 420–435 nm range. AgNP biosynthesis was optimal at 0.4 g/L AgNO3 concentration under alkaline conditions at 60–70 °C. The biosynthesized AgNPs showed higher stability compared to chemogenized AgNPs in the presence of electrolytes. AgNPs synthesized by P. aeruginosa were the most stable while NPs of S. aureus were the least stable. AgNPs synthesized by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus showed good antimicrobial potential against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, MRSA and Candida albicans. AgNPs synthesized by S. aureus had greater antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of NPs may vary depending on the size and the morphology of NPs."

In this study, we aimed to determine the gamma radiation dose required for the decontamination of paper, fabric and liquid materials without causing any damage to the structure of these materials. Each study group included 11 pieces of paper, fabric and sterile saline contaminated with 0.8 × 105 virulent Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) spores. These specimens were exposed to doses of 5.49, 11.58, 17.21, 21.75, 27 and 33.1 kilogray (kGy) of gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source. After irradiation of all the samples, a viability assessment of the B. anthracis spores was performed. It was found that full decontamination was achieved with 11.58 kGy on the paper samples and 17.21 kGy on the fabric and liquid samples. It was concluded that a dose of 20 kGy of gamma radiation may be recommended for the inactivation of B. anthracis for some surfaces when especially sensitive and valuable materials cannot be wet decontaminated were exposed. In addition, serologic and molecular assays of the suspected packets can be performed for forensic purposes without damaging existing evidence in a bioterror incident."

abstract,"Abstract Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus that poses a threat to human worldwide. Driven by the lack of approved medication and vaccination, research on anti-Chikungunya agents has received great attention. In an effort to determine potential inhibitor of CHIKV, this study aimed at investigating the potential anti-viral activity of Oroxylum indicum extracts towards CHIKV-infected Vero cells. The virucidal, pre- and post-treatment effects of O. indicum were evaluated, using the maximum non-toxic dose of O. indicum methanol and aqueous extracts as determined by cytotoxicity assay. The viral inhibitory effect was assessed by the morphological changes of Vero cells and further confirmed by plaque assay. Both methanol and aqueous extracts of O. indicum had similar cytotoxicity in Vero cells. Interestingly, the virucidal effect of O. indicum aqueous extract revealed a significant reduction on the viral titre (p < 0.05). The prophylactic effect of aqueous extract was demonstrated when the pre-treated cells exhibited a significant anti-CHIKV activity (p < 0.05). However, methanol extract of this plant exerted an anti-viral activity against CHIKV only to a certain extent. Therefore, the aqueous extract of this plant has a potential to inhibit the virus and acts as prophylactic agent against CHIKV. Further studies however are needed to substantiate the finding and to determine the important compound of this plant as well as the mechanism of action in treating CHIKV infection."

abstract,"Abstract 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), alongside polyvinylpyrrolidone is commonly used in plant DNA extractions to deal with polyphenols, which could interfere with extraction and downstream applications. 2-ME is also commonly used to denature proteins and nucleases, especially RNAses. On the contrary, we found that the presence of 2-ME in lysis buffer interfered with DNA extraction from 12 strains of freshwater microalgae, resulting in DNA with poor integrity. We also found that the TNES-urea buffer, commonly used for preservation and DNA extraction from fish, appears as effective as the SDS and CTAB buffer for some microalgae strains. Results  from our study suggests that the inclusion of 2-ME in DNA extraction protocols may be detrimental for isolation of good quality DNA from freshwater microalgae, and therefore recommend eliminating it or testing varying concentrations of 2-ME when developing species-specific extraction protocols for microalgae."

abstract,"Abstract In the present study, a method for easy and rapid synthesis of lipase nanohybrids was evaluated using cobalt chloride as an encapsulating agent. The synthesized nanohybrids exhibited higher activity (181%) compared to free lipase and improved catalytic properties at higher temperature and in harsh conditions. The nanohybrids retained 84% of their residual activity at 25 °C after 10 days. In addition, these nanohybrids also exhibited high storage stability and reusability. Collectively, the synthesis of carrier-free immobilized biocatalysts was performed rapidly within 24 h at 4 °C. Their high reusability and catalytic activities highlight the broad applicability of this method for catalysis in organic and aqueous media."

abstract,"Abstract This study reports extraction and characterization of carotenoid pigments from Microbacterium paraoxydans, a non-photosynthetic bacterium, cultivated in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium. The isolate was identified to be moderately halo- and osmo-tolerant capable of withstanding high (~ 6%) salt and sugar (30% w/v sucrose, 20% w/v glucose) concentrations after a brief period of adaptation. The pigments were characterized using a combination of UV–Vis spectral analysis with the λmax at 407, 436 and 466 nm and ESI–MS with an m/z value at 536.44. The absorption profile of the pigments and their nature was influenced by carbon, nitrogen source and presence of salt in the growth medium. Highest level of pigment (~ 16 g kg dry wt cells−1) was produced in NH4Cl supplemented LB medium. The pigment displayed free radical scavenging, anticancer activity, characteristic of the plant carotenoids. Based on the accumulation of pigments under different conditions, a biochemical pathway for synthesis of neurosporene was proposed."

abstract,"Abstract  Mycobacterium mageritense, a rapidly growing mycobacterium, is a rare clinical pathogen. Furthermore, parotitis due to non-tuberculosis mycobacterium is very rare in adults. Herein, we report the first case of M. mageritense parotitis in an immunocompetent adult. A 40-year-old man presented with swelling in a left parotid lesion. He was diagnosed with parotitis. The culture from the parotid abscess grew M. mageritense. He was unsuccessfully treated with levofloxacin monotherapy. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was added, leading to some clinical response; however, the erythema persisted despite 14 months of antibiotic therapy. Subsequently, the skin lesion was surgically removed. The antibiotic treatment was ceased a week after surgery as the postoperative course was uneventful and the lesion had improved. No recurrence was noted at 7 months after surgery. Although extremely rare, M. mageritense can cause parotitis in immunocompetent adults, and may not be sufficiently treated with antibiotics alone."

abstract,"Abstract Yeast–mold mycobiota inhabit several natural ecosystems, in which symbiotic relationships drive strategic pathoadaptation. Mycotoxins are metabolites produced by diverse mycotoxigenic fungi as a defense against yeasts, though at times yeasts secrete enzymes that degrade, detoxify, or bio-transform mycotoxins. The present study is focused on the in vitro inhibitory effects of zearalenone (ZEN), a F2 mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium and Gibberella species, on different microbial strains. ZEN exhibited no effect on the planktonic growth or biofilms of several Gram positive and negative bacteria at the tested concentrations. Remarkably, Candida albicans biofilm formation and hyphal morphogenesis were significantly inhibited when treated with 100 µg/mL of ZEN. Likewise, ZEN proficiently disrupted pre-formed C. albicans biofilms without disturbing planktonic cells. Furthermore, these inhibitions were confirmed by crystal violet staining and XTT reduction assays and by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In an in vivo model, ZEN significantly suppressed C. albicans infection in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The study reports the in vitro antibiofilm efficacy of ZEN against C. albicans strains, and suggests mycotoxigenic fungi participate in asymmetric competitive interactions, such as, amensalism or antibiosis, rather than commensal interactions with C. albicans, whereby mycotoxins secreted by fungi destroy C. albicans biofilms."

abstract,"Abstract In the present investigation, a novel fungus was isolated from leather watch strap and identified as Aspergillus versicolor TANCK-1 by 18 s rRNA sequencing. The isolated fungus was evaluated against three structurally different fungicides such as 2-(thiocyanomethylthio)benzothiazole (TCMTB), potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate (KDDC) and 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNP) to control the fungal growth. Among these, TCMTB was found to effectively inhibit the growth at a minimum concentration of 31.2 µg/mL as compared to 1250 and 625 µg/mL for KDDC and DBNP respectively. Increased membrane permeability in the fungicide treated samples was evident from cellular release and decrease in cellular ergosterol content. Nevertheless, SEM analysis revealed a considerable change in fungicide treated mycelium with the collapse of hyphae structure and shrunken spores, which was observed to be very pronounced in KDDC and DBNP. Results  indicated that all three biocides bring about inhibition through membrane damage with almost negligible effect on the cell wall.

abstract,"Abstract In an earlier study from this laboratory, Vibrio fluvialis BD146, a clinical isolate from Kolkata, India, 2002, was found to be resistant to all the fourteen antibiotics tested. It harboured a high copy number plasmid pBD146 and a low copy number plasmid. In the present study, a more detailed analysis was carried out to unravel different resistance mechanisms in this isolate. Sequencing showed that variable region of class 1 integron located on low copy number plasmid harbored arr3-cmlA-bla OXA10-aadA1 gene cassettes. Analysis for extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) revealed that BD146 was ESBL positive. Efflux pumps were involved in the drug resistance phenotype for chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin and tetracycline. Sequence analysis of pBD146 revealed the presence of genes encoding BDint an integrase with a unique sequence having little similarity to other known integrases, toxin–antitoxin (parE/parD), a replicase, trimethoprim resistance (dfrVI) and quinolone resistance (qnrVC5). Presence of cmlA, putative novel integrase and toxin–antitoxin system in V. fluvialis has been documented for the first time in this report. pBD146 showed 99% sequence similarity with pVN84 from V. cholerae O1 of Vietnam, 2004 and a plasmid from V. parahaemolyticus v110 of Hong Kong, 2010. Conjugation experiments proved the ability of pBD146 and the low copy number plasmid, to get transferred to another host imparting their antibiotic resistance traits to the transconjugants. Therefore, present study has indicated that plasmids played an important role for dissemination of drug resistance."

abstract,"Abstract  Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is an important food borne pathogen responsible for listeriosis. Further, LM is an etiological agent associated with life threatening conditions like meningitis and encephalitis. Biofilm forming and drug resistant LM may potentially become difficult to treat infections and hence effective controlling measures are required to prevent LM infections. In view of this, the present study evaluated an anti-listerial potential of edible brown seaweed, Eisenia bicyclis, by disc diffusion and micro-dilution methods. The results of the present study suggested that the anti-listerial activity of various phlorotannins isolated form E. bicyclis were in the range of 16–256 µg/ml. Among the phlorotannins isolated, fucofuroeckol-A (FAA) exhibited the highest anti-listerial potential (MIC range 16–32 µg/ml) against LM strains tested. Further, in checker board synergy assays, FFA-streptomycin combination exhibited significant synergy (fractional inhibitory concentration index, ∑FIC < 0.5) against aminoglycoside resistant clinical strains of LM. The results of the present study suggested the potential use of edible seaweed E. bicyclis as a source of natural phlorotannins to control food borne pathogenic infections."

abstract,"Abstract Tuberculosis is a significant problem globally for domestic animals as well as captive and free ranging wild life. Rapid point of care (POC) serology kits are well suited for the diagnosis of TB in wild animals. However, wild animals are invariably exposed to environmental non-pathogenic mycobacterium species with the development of cross reacting antibodies. In the present study, POC TB diagnosis kit was developed using a combination of pathogenic Mycobacteria specific recombinant antigens and purified protein derivatives of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Mycobacteria. To benchmark the TB antibody detection kit, particularly in respect to specificity which could not be determined in wildlife due to the lack of samples from confirmed uninfected animals, we first tested well-characterized sera from 100 M. bovis infected and 100 uninfected cattle. Then we investigated the kit’s performance using sera samples from wildlife, namely Sloth Bears (n = 74), Elephants (n = 9), Cervidae (n = 14), Felidae (n = 21), Cape buffalo (n = 2), Wild bear (n = 1) and Wild dog (n = 1).In cattle, a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 90% were obtained. The diagnostic sensitivity of the kit was 94% when the kit was tested using known TB positive sloth bear sera samples. 47.4% of the in-contact sloth bears turned seropositive using the rapid POC TB diagnostic kit. Seropositivity in other wild animals was 25% when the sera samples were tested using the kit. A point of care TB sero-diagnostic kit with the combination of proteins was developed and the kit was validated using the sera samples of wild animals."

abstract,"Abstract Exopolysaccharide produced by a unique avirulent Bacillus anthracis strain PFAB2 of hot spring origin has been characterized and its functional properties are investigated which is a first report. Maximum yield of EPS is 7.66 g/l with 2% glucose and 1% peptone as optimum carbon and nitrogen source respectively. The EPS is found to be a homopolymer consisting of only glucose as principle monosaccharide component. Through 1H NMR study, different dextran-like proton peaks are observed. Molecular weight of the EPS resembles low molecular weight bacterial origin polysaccharides. Melting transition of the EPS has started after 276 °C which indicates good thermal stability. The EPS also shows potent antioxidant activity in terms of DPPH and ABTS mediated free radical scavenging property compared to standard ascorbic acid. Emulsifying property of the EPS is also observed and has shown good emulsification of vegetable oils. The polysaccharide forms a thermo resistant gel during the heating phase, with G′ higher than G″ indicating excellent shear-thinning behaviour and viscoelastic nature of the EPS."

abstract,"Abstract  Deinococcus radiodurans was considered as one of the most radiation-resistant organisms on Earth because of its strong resistance to the damaging factors of both DNA and protein, including ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation, oxidants, and desiccation. PprM, as a bacterial cold shock protein homolog, was involved in the radiation resistance and oxidative stress response of D. radiodurans, but its potential mechanisms are poorly expounded. In this study, we found that PprM was highly conserved with the RNA-binding domain in Deinococcus genus through performing phylogenic analysis. Moreover, the paper presents the analysis on the tolerance of environmental stresses both in the wild-type and the pprM/pprM RBD mutant strains, demonstrating that pprM and RNA-binding domain disruptant strain were with higher sensitivity than the wild-type strain to cold stress, mitomycin C, UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide. In the following step, the recombinant PprM was purified, with the finding that PprM was bound to the 5’-untranslated region of its own mRNA by gel mobility shift assay in vitro. With all these findings taken into consideration, it was suggested that PprM act as a cold shock protein and its RNA-binding domain may be involved in reaction to the extreme environmental stress in D. radiodurans."

abstract,"Abstract A natural red dye which is produced by the tiny insects Kerria lacca while feeding on host trees is popularly known as lac dye. Lac dye is a mixture of at least five closely related pure compounds all being anthraquinone derivatives designated as laccaic acid A, B, C, D and E. Anthraquinones isolated from different natural sources and reported to have potent antimicrobial activity. The lac dye, which is also a mixture of anthraquinone derivatives, is expected to exhibit antifungal and antibacterial activity. Lac dye cannot be used as antibacterial and antifungal agent due to its low water solubility and high polarity. Therefore, it is modified into its methyl derivative to enhance its bio-efficacy. Methylated lac dye is characterized with the help of TLC, UV–Vis spectroscopy and FT-IR, NMR analysis. An in vitro spore germination assay was carried out to evaluate the antifungal efficacy of methylated lac dye against some phytopathogenic fungi which commonly caused a various foliar diseases in crop plants viz., Alternaria solani, Curvularia lunata, Erysiphe pisi, Helminthosporium oryzae and Verticillium sp. Among the tested fungi, Verticillum sp. showed highest sensitivity, which showed 100% inhibition at 750 and 1000 µg/ml as compared to control. However, E. pisi an obligate parasite also showed varied sensitivity but at 1000 µg/ml showed 100% spore germination as compared to control. Methylated lac dye also showed strong antibacterial properties against Ralstonia solanacearum at very low concentration (40 and 50 µg/ml). Hence, lac dye may serve as potent antifungal and antibacterial agent in plant disease management."

abstract,"Abstract The present study was aimed to investigate the health of vegetative and reproductive parts of sesame plants during Bacillus methylotrophicus KE2 interaction by their pigments, sugars, organic acid, amino acids, hormones and antioxidant production analysis. In a green-house study, B. methylotrophicus KE2 was sprayed to sesame plants at late flowering stage. The bacterial treatment enhanced photosynthetic pigments of plants including pods than their controls. The shoots of plants had higher amount of sucrose, glucose, galactose, xylitol and malic acid, and while the pods of plants showed the more accumulation of sucrose, glucose, inulin and xylitol in bacterium treated plants. However, alanine, cysteine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, arginine and proline content in shoots and cysteine in pods were increased by the effect of KE2 inoculation. Salicylic acid production was declined in shoots and increased in pods during bacterial exposure. In addition, abscisic acid concentration was lower in pods due to the effect of B. methylotrophicus KE2 in pods over controls. The total polyphenol synthesis was increased in shoots and pods of sesame plants by bacterial interaction. The results of this study revealed that foliar spray of B. methylotrophicus KE2 on sesame plants triggered the plant growth promoting and defense metabolites in vegetative and reproductive organs to improve the health status of sesame."

The Baikal strain is highly similar (98–99%) to the N. punctiforme CCAP 1453/9 strain and the typical N. punctiforme PCC 73103 strain isolated from soil ecotopes. Based on the analysis of functional genes and mass spectrometry data, we determined that the strain can produce bioactive peptides and polyketides, but does not produce known cyanobacterial toxins, saxitoxin or its analogs, or microcystins. The peptides aeruginosinamide, aeruginosin 606, aeruginosin 98-A, kasumigamide C, and microginin 91-D were recorded in the metabolic profile of the strain. The major ion found in the MALDI mass spectrum is most likely to be an ion of a polyketide substance with unknown function."

abstract,"Abstract The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections with multi-drug resistance needs effective and alternative control strategies. In this study we investigated the adjuvant effect of a novel furan fatty acid, 7,10-epoxyoctadeca-7,9-dienoic acid (7,10-EODA) against multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) strain 01ST001 by disc diffusion, checker board and time kill assays. Further the membrane targeting action of 7,10-EODA was investigated by spectroscopic and confocal microscopic studies. 7,10-EODA exerted synergistic activity along with β-lactam antibiotics against all clinical MRSA strains, with a mean fractional inhibitory concentration index below 0.5. In time-kill kinetic study, combination of 7,10-EODA with oxacillin, ampicillin, and penicillin resulted in 3.8–4.2 log10 reduction in the viable counts of MDRSA 01ST001. Further, 7,10-EODA dose dependently altered the membrane integrity (p < 0.001) and increased the binding of fluorescent analog of penicillin, Bocillin-FL to the MDRSA cells. The membrane action of 7,10-EODA further facilitated the uptake of several other antibiotics in MDRSA. The results of the present study suggested that 7,10-EODA could be a novel antibiotic adjuvant, especially useful in repurposing β-lactam antibiotics against multidrug-resistant MRSA."

abstract,"Abstract A mutant strain of Vibiro alginolyticus with an in-frame deletion of the toxR gene was constructed to reveal the role of ToxR in the physiology and virulence of V. alginolyticus. The statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the growth ability, swarming motility, activity of extracellular protease and the virulence by injection (the value of LD50) between the wild-type and the toxR mutant. However, the deletion of toxR could decrease the level of biofilm formation. The comparative proteomic analysis demonstrated the deletion mutation of toxR could up-regulate the expression of glutamine synthetase and levansucrase, and down-regulate the expression of 10 proteins such as OmpU, DnaK, etc. These results suggest that ToxR may be involved in the early stages of infection by influencing colonization of the bacteria on the surface of the intestine through enhancing the biofilm information of V. alginolyticus via modulating the expression of glutamine synthetize, levansucrase and OmpU."

abstract,"Abstract The physiological effects of Fusarium oxysporum on in-root parasitic weed, Orobanche spp. (broomrape) with references to change in plant hormones and secondary plant constituents were investigated. The levels of IAA, GA, ABA and JA in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the level of SA was higher in the experimental group. In secondary metabolic studies, the quantities of various phenols were measured in the two groups and catechin, syringic acid and p-coumaric acid amounts were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group, unlike gallic acid which have a lower amount. Consequently, in the light of all data, it was concluded that Fusarium oxysporum (1) causes heavy hormonal disorder, (2) triggered only SA-mediated defense and (3) induced intensively accumulation of phenolic substances in orobanche. Fusarium oxysporum causes lethal physiological damage on Orobanche spp."

abstract,"Abstract The present study was aimed to develop and evaluate dot–blot assays for rapid detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin-A (SEA) in food. Dot blots were developed in two formats, indirect and sandwich utilizing mouse monoclonal anti-SEA and rabbit polyclonal anti-SEA antibodies. In indirect dot–blot format, recombinant SEA was directly coated on NCM dot–blot strip and detection was carried out by anti-SEA antibodies. In sandwich dot–blot format, SEA was trapped between anti-SEA capture and detection antibodies. Both the dot–blot assays exhibited a sensitivity of ~48 ng ml−1 when tested in different food matrices. The developed assays were highly specific as no cross-reactivity was detected with other classical staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxigenic bacteria and foodborne pathogens. Sensitivity and specificity of developed indirect and sandwich dot–blot assays with respect to PCR was found to be 100 and 99%, respectively. The results shows that the developed dot–blot assays can be used as rapid preliminary screening tests for detection of SEA in food or determining the toxigenic potential of staphylococci, especially in resource-limited settings."

abstract,"Abstract Bacteria under stress conditions of excess of carbon (C) and limitations of nutrients divert its metabolism towards C storage as energy reservoir—polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Different Bacillus species—B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, were monitored to produce PHA from different C sources—glucose, crude glycerol and their combination at 37 °C for period up to 192 h. PHA production and its composition was found to vary with feed and bacterial strains. PHA production on crude glycerol continued to increase up to 120 h, reaching a maximum of 2725 mg/L with an effective yield of 71% of the dry cell mass. Depolymerization of PHA was observe to initiate after 96 h of incubation up to 192 h. PHA degradation products have been envisaged to be applied in medical field: tissue engineering, drug carriers, memory enhancers, antiosteoporosis, biodegradable implants. The PHA production and degradation cycle for 192 h has not been reported previously in literature."

abstract,Abstract Antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be done using solid or liquid-based medium. Solid-based assays are easy and inexpensive; they are limited by not being as quantitative as liquid-based assays. Agar depth can influence the accuracy of plate-based assays and it is assumed the basis of this effect is antimicrobial agent diffusion. We tested this assumption by using ETEST® to quantitate the relationship between agar depth and minimum inhibitory concentration and zone of inhibition.

abstract,"Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly bacterial infectious disease caused by intra-cellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). There were an estimated 1.4 million TB deaths in 2015 and an additional 0.4 million deaths resulting from TB among individuals with HIV. Drug-discovery for its cure is very slow in comparison with the causative organism’s fast pace of mutations conferring drug resistance. Moreover, the field of drug-discovery of anti-TB drugs is constantly being challenged by the drug resistant strains of Mtb. Several molecules/inhibitors are being tested across the pharmaceutical industry and research centres for their suitability as drug candidate. It takes immense effort, high costs and a whole lot of screening to bring a single molecule to the clinics for patient cure. In last 60 years, hundreds of molecules have been patented for their probable use to develop drug for treatment of TB. However, only one drug has been successfully approved that is bedaquiline (1-(6-bromo-2 -methoxy-quinolin-3-yl)-4-dimethylamino-2-naphtalen-1-yl-1-phenyl-butan-2-ol). This is a brief review about bedaquiline (BDQ), the only drug in last 45 years approved for curing drug-resistant pulmonary TB, its development, action mechanism and development of resistance against it."

abstract,"Abstract  Durian is one important tropical fruit with high nutritional value, but its shell is usually useless and considered as waste. To explore the efficient and high-value utilization of this agricultural and food waste, in this study, durian shell was simply hydrolyzed by dilute sulfuric acid, and the durian shell hydrolysate after detoxification was used for bacterial cellulose (BC) production by Gluconacetobacter xylinus for the first time. BC was synthesized in static culture for 10 days and the highest BC yield (2.67 g/L) was obtained at the 8th day. The typical carbon sources in the substrate including glucose, xylose, formic acid, acetic acid, etc. can be utilized by G. xylinus. The highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (16.40%) was obtained at the 8th day. The highest BC yield on COD consumption and the highest BC yield on sugar consumption were 93.51% and 22.98% (w/w), respectively, suggesting this is one efficient bioconversion for BC production. Durian shell hydrolysate showed small influence on the BC structure by comparison with the structure of BC generated in traditional Hestrin–Schramm medium detected by FE-SEM, FTIR, and XRD. Overall, this technology can both solve the issue of waste durian shell and produce valuable bio-polymer (BC)."

abstract,"Abstract Resurgence of sensitivity of the antibiotics, to which the pathogen had developed resistance in the past, requires special attention for strengthening the reservoir of antimicrobial compounds. Reports in the recent past have suggested that co-trimoxazole (COT) has regained its activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The present study exploited the use of COT in the presence of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), cryptdin-2 (a murine Paneth cell alpha defensin), in order to reduce the selective pressure of the antibiotic on the pathogen. In vitro antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy of the combination was ascertained against MRSA induced systemic infection using a murine model. Observations of the present study might help in restoring the regained activity of conventional antibiotics, such as COT, when used in combination with novel antimicrobial molecules like AMPs. This might prove as a viable strategy to eliminate the chances of re-occurrence of resistance due to their multi-prong targeting and synergistically combating infections caused by these resistant pathogens."

abstract,"Abstract Marine bacteria possess a wide variety of bioremediation potential which is beneficial environmentally and economically. In this study, bacterial isolates from marine waters were screened for tolerance and growth in high concentrations of chromate (Cr6+). Two isolates, capable of tolerating Cr6+ concentrations 300 µg mL−1 or higher, and found to completely reduce 20 µg mL−1 Cr6+ were grown in Cr6+ (50 and 100 mg kg−1) spiked garden soil. Notably, both facilitated normal germination and growth of mung (Vigna radiata) seeds, which could hardly germinate in Cr6+ spiked garden soil without either of these bacteria. In fact, large percent of mung seeds failed to sprout in the Cr6+ spiked garden soil and could not grow any further. Apparently, chromate detoxification by marine bacterial isolates and the ability of mung plants to deal with the reduced form appear to work complementarily. This study provides an insight into marine bacterial abilities with respect to chromium and potential applications in promoting growth of leguminous plants-similar to mung in particular-in Cr6+ contaminated soil."

abstract,"Abstract Development of nanostructured films using natural polymers and metals has become a considerable interest in various biomedical applications. Objective of the present study was to develop silver nano particles (AgNPs) embedded chitosan films with antimicrobial properties. Based on the Ag content, two types of chitosan silver nano films, named as CAgNfs-12 (12 mM) and CAgNfs-52 (52 mM) were prepared and characterized. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of two CAgNfs showed the circular AgNPs, which were uniformly embedded and distributed in the matrix of chitosan films. Antimicrobial experiment results clearly indicated that CAgNfs can inhibit the growth of fish pathogenic bacteria Vibrio (Allivibrio) salmonicida, V. tapetis, Edwardsiella tarda and fungi Fusarium oxysporum. Moreover, CAgNfs significantly reduced the experimentally exposed V. salmonicida levels in artificial seawater, suggesting that these CAgNfs could be used to develop antimicrobial filters/membranes for water purifying units to eliminate the pathogenic microbes.Graphical Abstract   Open image in new window  "

To evaluate the influence of the storage condition on the composition of cell fatty acids, genetic profile and biochemical characteristics of Xanthomonas campestris pv. mangiferaeindicae IBSBF 2103, as well as, to identify its relationship with the yielding and viscosity of the xanthan gum produced, this study monitored the strain preserved in two simple and widely used conditions, ultra-freezer (−80 °C) and refrigeration (3–8 °C) during 5 months. Were identified and quantified 13 fatty acids. The cells preserved at −80 °C showed more stable concentration of all fatty acids, producing more xanthan gum and with higher viscosity. The chromosomal analysis obtained with the enzyme XbaI revealed 17 distinct fragments with maximum size of 485 kilobases, without variations among the subcultures maintained in both storage conditions. The X. campestris pv. mangiferaeindicae subcultures preserved at −80 °C showed less pronounced phenotypic variations, which had positive influence in the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the xanthan gum produced."

abstract,"Abstract In view of emerging drug resistance in pathogens, there is a need to explore alternative strategies to combat infections. Use of probiotics is one such option. In this regard, efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum has been reported against Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we propose that cell free supernatant (CFS) of Lactobacillus paraplantarum when used in combination with conventional antibiotics viz. ampicillin and oxacillin [to which the methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were originally resistant] reduce the minimum inhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics, rendering the combination either synergistic or additive against the tested MRSA strain. The anti-staphylococcal activity was observed to be due to organic acids (acetic acid and lactic acid as confirmed by HPLC analysis) present in the CFS, as neutralization of the CFS with an alkali, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), caused the complete abrogation of its activity. The role of H2O2 and bacteriocin present in the CFS was also ruled out. The findings of this study suggest that cell free supernatant and ampicillin/oxacillin combination(s) might help in rejuvenating the use of conventional anti-staphylococcal antibiotics for the treatment of multi-drug resistant strains."

abstract,"Abstract Several fungi and starch-rich industrial residues were screened for itaconic acid (IA) production. Out of 15 strains, only three fungal strains were found to produce IA, which was confirmed by HPLC and GC–MS analysis. These strains were identified as Aspergillus terreus strains C1 and C2, and Ustilago maydis strain C3 by sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer regions. Cis-aconitate decarboxylase (cad) gene, which encodes a key enzyme in IA production in A. terreus, was characterized from strains C1 and C2. C1 and C2 cad gene sequences showed about 96% similarity to the only available GenBank sequence of A. terreus cad gene. 3-D structure and cis-aconitic acid binding pocket of Cad enzyme were predicted by structural modeling. Rice, corn and potato starch wastes were screened for IA production. These materials were enzymatically hydrolyzed under experimentally optimized conditions resulting in the highest glucose production of 230 mg/mL from 20% potato waste. On comparing the production potential of selected strains with different wastes, the best IA production was achieved with strain C1 (255.7 mg/L) using potato waste. Elemental composition as well as batch-to-batch variation in waste substrates were analyzed. The difference in IA production from two different batches of potato waste was found to inversely correlate with their phosphorus content, which indicated that A. terreus produced IA under phosphate limiting condition. The potato waste hydrolysate was deionized to remove inhibitory ions like phosphate, resulting in improved IA production of 4.1 g/L by C1 strain, which is commercially competitive."

abstract,"Abstract Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were found to be capable of tolerating a certain amount of oxygen (O2), but how they affect oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has not been clear. The present work investigated the impact of SRB on ORR in 3.5 wt% sodium chloride solution with the cyclic voltammetry method. The addition of SRB culture solution hampered both the reduction of O2 to superoxide (O 2 ·− ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water (H2O), and the influence of SRB metabolites was much larger than that of bacterial cells. Sulfide and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), typical inorganic and organic metabolic products, had great impact on ORR. Sulfide played an important role in the decrease of cathodic current for H2O2 reduction due to its hydrolysis and chemical reaction activity with H2O2. EPS were sticky, easy to adsorb on the electrode surface and abundant in functional groups, which hindered the transformation of O2 into O 2 ·−  and favored the reduction of H2O2 to H2O."

abstract,"Abstract A metagenomic library of sea sediment metagenome containing 245,000 recombinant clones representing ~ 2.45 Gb of sea sediment microbial DNA was constructed. Two unique arsenic resistance clones, A7 and A12, were identified by selection on sodium arsenite containing medium. Clone A7 showed a six-fold higher resistance to arsenate [As(V)], a three-fold higher resistance to arsenite [As(III)] and significantly increased resistance to antimony [Sb(III)], while clone A12 showed increased resistance only to sodium arsenite and not to the other two metalloids. The clones harbored inserts of 8.848 Kb and 6.771 Kb, respectively. Both the clones possess A + T rich nucleotide sequence with similarity to sequences from marine psychrophilic bacteria. Sequence and transposon-mutagenesis based analysis revealed the presence of a putative arsenate reductase (ArsC), a putative arsenite efflux pump (ArsB/ACR) and a putative NADPH-dependent FMN reductase (ArsH) in both the clones and also a putative transcriptional regulatory protein (ArsR) in pA7. The increased resistance of clone A7 to As(V), As(III) and Sb(III) indicates functional expression of ArsC and ArsB proteins from pA7. The absence of increased As(V) resistance in clone A12 may be due to the expression of a possible inactive ArsC, as conserved Arg60 residue in this protein was replaced by Glu60, while the absence of Sb(III) resistance may be due to the presence of an ACR3p-type arsenite pump, which is known to lack antimony transport ability."

abstract,"Abstract  Deinococcus radiodurans has attracted a great interest in the past decades due to its extraordinary resistance to ionizing radiation and highly efficient DNA repair system. Recent studies indicated that pprM is a putative pleiotropic gene in D. radiodurans and plays an important role in radioresistance and antioxidation, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly elucidated. In this study, pprM mutation was generated to investigate resistance to desiccation and oxidative stress. The result showed that the survival of pprM mutant under desiccation was markedly retarded compared to the wild strain from day 7–28. Furthermore, knockout of pprM increases the intercellular accumulation of ROS and the sensibility to H2O2 stress in the bacterial growth inhibition assay. The absorbance spectrum experiment for detecting the carotenoid showed that deinoxanthin, a carotenoid that peculiarly exists in Deinococcus, was reduced in the pprM mutant in the pprM mutant. Quantitative real time PCR showed decreased expression of three genes viz. CrtI (DR0861, 50%),CrtB (DR0862, 40%) and CrtO (DR0093, 50%), which are involved in deinoxanthin synthesis, and of Dps (DNA protection during starving) gene (DRB0092) relevant to ion combining and DNA protection in cells. Our results suggest that pprM may affect antioxidative ability of D. radiodurans by regulating the synthesis of deinoxanthin and the concentration of metal ions. This may provide new clues for the treatment of antioxidants."

abstract,"Abstract An increasing concern on resistance to multiple-antibiotics has led to the discovery of novel agents and the establishment of new precaution strategy. Numerous plant sources have been widely studied to reduce virulence of pathogenic bacteria by interfering cell-to-cell based communication called quorum sensing (QS). Leaf extracts of 17 gardening trees were collected and investigated for their anti-QS effects using a sensor strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV026. Methanolic extracts of K4 (Acer palmatum), K9 (Acer pseudosieboldianum) and K13 (Cercis chinensis) leaves were selected for further experiments based on their antagonism effect on QS without inhibiting C. violaceum CV026 growth. Subsequently, the leaf extracts on QS-mediated virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 involved in biofilm formation, motility, bioluminescence, pyocyanin production, QS molecules production, and Caenorhabditis elegans killing activity were evaluated. The biofilm formation ability and swarming motility of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were decreased approximately 50% in the presence of these leaf extracts at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The expression level of lecA::lux of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and pyocyanin production were also reduced. The three leaf extracts also decreased autoinducer (AI) production in P. aeruginosa PAO1 without direct degradation, suggesting that AI synthesis might have been suppressed by these extracts. The three leaf extracts also showed anti-infection activity in C. elegans model. Taken together, these results suggest that methanolic leaf extracts of K4, K9 and K13 have the potential to attenuate the virulence of P. aeruginosa PAO1."

abstract,"Abstract Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are produced by a large number of microbes under stress conditions such as high carbon (C) availability and limitations of nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and oxygen. Here, microbes store C as granules of PHAs—energy reservoir. PHAs have properties, which are quite similar to those of synthetic plastics. The unique properties, which make them desirable materials for biomedical applications is their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity. PHAs have been found suitable for various medical applications: biocontrol agents, drug carriers, biodegradable implants, tissue engineering, memory enhancers, and anticancer agents."

abstract,"Abstract Ergosterol, an important component of the fungal cell membrane, is not only essential for fungal growth and development but also very important for adaptation to stress in fungi. Ergosterol is also a direct precursor for steroid drugs. The biosynthesis of ergosterol can be divided into three modules: mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate (farnesyl-PP) and ergosterol biosynthesis. The regulation of ergosterol content is mainly achieved by feedback regulation of ergosterol synthase activity through transcription, translation and posttranslational modification. The synthesis of HMG-CoA, catalyzed by HMGR, is a major metabolic check point in ergosterol biosynthesis. Excessive sterols can be subsequently stored in lipid droplets or secreted into the extracellular milieu by esterification or acetylation to avoid toxic effects. As sterols are insoluble, the intracellular transport of ergosterol in cells requires transporters. In recent years, great progress has been made in understanding ergosterol biosynthesis and its regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, few reviews have focused on these studies, especially the regulation of biosynthesis and intracellular transport. Therefore, this review summarizes recent research progress on the physiological functions, biosynthesis, regulation of biosynthesis and intracellular transportation of ergosterol in S. cerevisiae."

abstract,"Abstract Phosphate depletion is one of the favorable ways to enhance the sewage water treatment with the algae, however, detailed information is essential with respect to internal phosphate concentration and physiology of the algae. The growth rate of the phosphate-starved Scenedesmus cells was reduced drastically after 48 h. Indicating cells entered in the stationary phase of the growth cycle. Fourier Transform Infrared analysis of phosphate-starved Scenedesmus cells showed the reduction in internal phosphate concentration and an increase in carbohydrate/phosphate and carbohydrate/lipid ratio. The phosphate-starved Scenedesmus cells, with an initial cell density of, 1 × 106 cells mL−1 shows 87% phosphate and 100 % nitrogen removal in 24 h. The normal Scenedesmus cells need approximately 48 h to trim down the nutrients from wastewater up to this extent. Other microalgae, Ankistrodesmus, growth pattern was not affected due to phosphate starvation. The cells of Ankistrodesmus was able to reduce 71% phosphate and 73% nitrogen within 24 h, with an initial cell density of, 1 × 106 cells mL−1."

abstract,"Abstract In the present study, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesis was carried out by using a rare bacteriophage which is morphologically similar to 7–11 phages of the C3 morphotype of tailed phage belonging to Podoviridae family as green route. Effect of various physiological parameters like pH, temperature and concentration of gold chloride salt on AuNPs synthesis was studied. The reaction mixtures have shown vivid colours at various physiological parameters. Phage inspired AuNPs were further characterized by using different techniques such as UV–Vis spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS study revealed synthesis of various sizes of AuNPs in the range of 20–100 nm. SEM studies revealed synthesis of varied shaped AuNPs, viz., spheres, hexagons, triangles, rhomboids and rectangular etc. The presence of Au in the nanostructures was confirmed by EDS. The XRD pattern reflects the crystalline nature and nano size of AuNPs. These phage inspired AuNPs showed anti-bacterial activity against different bacterial pathogens. Anti-biofilm activity of AuNPs was evaluated on a glass slide. It was noticed that at 0.2 mM concentration of these AuNPs about 80% of biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen was inhibited. Thus, the phage inspired AuNPs synthesis could be potential therapeutic agents against human pathogens."

abstract,"Abstract There is a general impression in the scientific community in our country that the way science is taught, leant and the work culture of research and management of academic and research institutions is not conducive to cutting edge research, innovation and making world leaders. Mentoring continues to be poor with some exceptions. Very often, senior scientists with long innings in science teaching and research express anguish at the status quo in spite of a number of policy documents and recommendations for change. Indian science culture (teaching, research as well as administration) is a matter of prime concern and the issues cannot be pushed under the carpet if we desire a qualitative change. Most of the institutions of higher learning churn out graduates and post graduates who are largely unemployable. There are concerns on the number of Ph.Ds and not on the quality of Ph.D. One major consequence of the weak post graduates and Ph.Ds is the non-availability of competent faculty. Weakness and lack of interest in science learning starts from school. Learning continues to be by rote which is the prime reason for our low global rank in science and mathematics competence. Teaching and research apart there are umpteen other issues in over all culture of institutions and universities engaged in science teaching and research. Few oases of excellence are exceptions in the vast pool of mediocrity. Some points which need prime attention are: adoption of a tenure track system on the pattern of US institutions; feedback on and evaluation of teaching and mentoring; bottom up approach for candid feedback on issues which require long term solutions for efficiency and sound deliverables, cultivating the culture of working in front line areas, full transparency in working and an all out exit from culture of feudalism. This transformation needs commitment on the part of the politicians who man the respective departments of science education, research and human resource development. I am sure such a cultural change and paradigm shift from the status quo does not need extra funds and can be surely ushered in without money."

abstract,"Abstract Probiotics play a vital role in clinical applications for the treatment of diarrhea, obesity and urinary tract infections. Phytate, an anti-nutrient, chelates essential minerals that are vital for human health. In the past few decades, research reports emphasize extensively on phytate degradation in animals. There is a growing need for finding alternate strategies of phytate utilization in human, as they are unable to produce phytase. At this juncture, probiotics can be utilized for phytase production to combat mineral deficiency in humans. The main focus of this review is on improving phosphate bioavailability by employing two approaches: supplementation of (1) fermented food products that contain probiotics and (2) recombinant phytase producing bacteria. In addition, several factors influencing phytase activity such as bacterial viability, optimal pH, substrate concentration and specificity were also discussed."

Unlike M. yunnanensis DSM 21948T, protease production by M. aloeverae AE-6 MCC 2184T was stringently controlled by pH. Protease induction study using different group of peptides, peptide carbohydrates and peptide macronutrient combinations showed variable response with both the organisms. Result indicated that the amount of protease was not directly related to cell biomass but it depends on nature of inducible peptides. In this study we also developed a modified agar-well assay for semi-quantitative data from large number of replicates."

abstract,"Abstract Nitrilases are commercial biocatalysts used for the synthesis of plastics, paints, fibers in the chemical industries, pharmaceutical drugs and herbicides for agricultural uses. Nitrilase hydrolyses the nitriles and dinitriles to their corresponding carboxylic acids and ammonia. They have a broad range of substrate specificities as well as enantio-, regio- and chemo-selective properties which make them useful for biotransformation of nitriles to important compounds because of which they are considered as ‘Green Catalysts’. Nitriles are widespread in nature and synthesized as a consequence of anthropogenic and biological activities. These are also present in certain plant species and are known to cause environmental pollution. Biotransformation using native organisms as catalysts tends to be insufficient since the enzyme of interest has very low amount in the total cellular protein, rate of reaction is slow along with the instability of enzymes. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, bioengineering offers an alternative approach to alter the properties of enzymes to enhance the applicability and stability. The present review highlights the aspects of producing the recombinant microorganisms and overexpressing the enzyme of interest for the enhanced stability at high temperatures, immobilization techniques, extremes of pH, organic solvents and hydrolysing dintriles to chiral compounds which may enhance the possibilities for creating specific enzymes for biotransformation."

Genome sequencing of strain Pt14 was performed using Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing to get insights into unique existence of this strain in acidic environment. Complete genome sequence of this strain revealed a chromosome of 5,841,722 bp having 5354 CDSs and 88 RNAs. Phylogenomic reconstruction based on 16S rRNA gene, Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values and marker proteins revealed that strain Pt14 shared a common clade with P. fluorescens strain A506 and strain SS101. ANI value of strain Pt14 in relation to strain A506 was found 99.23% demonstrating a very close sub-species association at genome level. Further, orthology determination among these three phylogenetic neighbors revealed 4726 core proteins. Functional analysis elucidated significantly higher abundance of sulphur metabolism (>1×) which could be one of the reasons for the survival of strain Pt14 under acidic conditions (pH 4.65). Acidophilic bacteria have capability to oxidize sulphur into sulphuric acid which in turn can make the soil acidic and genome-wide analysis of P. fluorescens Pt14 demonstrated that this strain contributes towards making the soil acidic."

abstract,"Abstract  Kung-Som is a popular traditional Thai fermented shrimp product. It is rich in glutamic acid, which is the major substrate for the biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In the present study, LAB from Kung-Som were isolated, screened for GABA formation, and the two isolates that transform glutamic acid most efficiently into GABA were identified. Based on the API-CHL50 fermentation profile and a phylogenetic tree of 16S rDNA sequences, strain CS3 and CS5 were identified as Lactobacillus futsaii, which was for the first time shown to be a promising GABA producer. L. futsaii CS3 was the most efficient microorganism for the conversion of 25 mg/mL monosodium glutamate (MSG) to GABA, with a maximum yield of more than 99% conversion rate within 72 h. The open reading frame (ORF) of the glutamate decarboxylase (gad) gene was identified by PCR. It consists of 1410 bp encoding a polypeptide of 469 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 53.64 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.56. Moreover, a good quality of the constructed model of L. futsaii CS3 was also estimated. Our results indicate that L. futsaii CS3 could be of interest for the production of GABA-enriched foods by fermentation and for other value-added products."

Among the different combinations of mixed biowastes including AP, OP, PP and pea-shells, the combination of OP and PP exhibited maximum H2 production of 73 and 84 L/kg TS with MMC4 and MMC6, respectively. This study suggested that H2 production can be effectively regulated by using defined sets of mixed cultures for hydrolysis and H2 production from pure and mixed biowastes as feed even under unsterile conditions."

abstract,"Abstract An HIV candidate vaccine for the Chinese population was designed by constructing a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing HIV-1 gag and HIV gp145 proteins via homologous recombination and plaque screening using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as the reporter gene. EGFP in the recombinant was then knocked out with the Cre/Loxp system yielding rFPVHg-Hp, which was identified at the genomic, transcriptional and translational levels. The immunogenicity of rFPVHg-Hp was analyzed by measuring levels of HIV-specific antibodies and IFN-γ-secreting splenocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IFN enzyme-linked immune spot test in the BALB/c mouse model. Results  showed that rFPV could not stimulate HIV-1 specific antibodies or IFN-γ-secreting cells by a single immunization. Meanwhile, in the prime-boost strategy, HIV-p24 antibodies (P < 0.01) and IFN-γ-secreting cells (P < 0.05) were induced strongly by the candidate vaccine after the boost immunization. Thus, both humoral and cellular immunity could be elicited by the candidate vaccine in a prime-boost immunization strategy. This study provides a foundation for future preclinical studies on the HIV rFPVHg-Hp candidate vaccine."

The three strains did not show bioamine production, mucinolytic and hemolytic activity and were susceptible to common antibiotics. The L. plantarum strains survived well in the simulated orogastrointestinal transit condition and showed adherence to Caco-2 cells in vitro. The L. plantarum strains showed strong antimicrobial activity against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Choleraesuis and Gallinarum compared to the commercial probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity of the L. plantarum strains appeared to be by the production of lactic acid. Furthermore, the L. plantarum strains tolerated freeze-drying and maintained higher viability in the presence of cryoprotectants than without cryoprotectants. Finally, the three L. plantarum strains tolerated NaCl up to 8% and maintained >60% growth. These characteristics of the three L. plantarum strains indicate that they could be applied as animal probiotic after appropriate in vivo studies."

abstract,"Abstract Comparative metagenomics approach has been used in this study to discriminate colonization of methanogenic population in different breeds of cattle. We compared two Indian cattle breeds (Gir and Kankrej) and two exotic cattle (Holstein and Jersey) breeds. Using a defined dietary plan for selected Indian varieties, the diet dependent shifts in microbial community and abundance of the enzymes associated with methanogenesis were studied. This data has been compared with the available rumen metagenome data from Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle. The abundance of genes for methanogenesis in Holstein and Jersey cattle came from Methanobacteriales order whereas, majority of the enzymes for methanogenesis in Gir and Kankrej cattle came from Methanomicrobiales order. The study suggested that by using slow/less digestible feed, the propionate levels could be controlled in rumen; and in turn, this would also help in further reducing the hydrogenotrophic production of methane. The study proposes that with the designed diet plan the overall methanogenic microbial pool or the individual methanogens could be targeted for development of methane mitigation strategies."

abstract,"Abstract Mangrove is a complex ecosystem that contains diverse microbial communities, including rare actinobacteria with great potential to produce bioactive compounds. To date, bioactive compounds extracted from mangrove rare actinobacteria have demonstrated diverse biological activities. The discovery of three novel rare actinobacteria by polyphasic approach, namely Microbacterium mangrovi MUSC 115T, Sinomonas humi MUSC 117T and Monashia flava MUSC 78T from mangrove soils at Tanjung Lumpur, Peninsular Malaysia have led to the screening on antibacterial, anticancer and neuroprotective activities. A total of ten different panels of bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300, ATCC 70069, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NRBC 112582 and others were selected for antibacterial screening. Three different neuroprotective models (hypoxia, oxidative stress, dementia) were done using SHSY5Y neuronal cells while two human cancer cells lines, namely human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29) and human cervical carcinoma cell lines (Ca Ski) were utilized for anticancer activity. The result revealed that all extracts exhibited bacteriostatic effects on the bacteria tested. On the other hand, the neuroprotective studies demonstrated M. mangrovi MUSC 115T extract exhibited significant neuroprotective properties in oxidative stress and dementia model while the extract of strain M. flava MUSC 78T was able to protect the SHSY5Y neuronal cells in hypoxia model. Furthermore, the extracts of M. mangrovi MUSC 115T and M. flava MUSC 78T exhibited anticancer effect against Ca Ski cell line. The chemical analysis of the extracts through GC–MS revealed that the majority of the compounds present in all extracts are heterocyclic organic compound that could explain for the observed bioactivities. Therefore, the results obtained in this study suggested that rare actinobacteria discovered from mangrove environment could be potential sources of antibacterial, anticancer and neuroprotective agents."

abstract,"Abstract Bacteria express certain of their characteristics especially, pathogenicity factors at high cell densities. The process is termed as quorum sensing (QS). QS operates via signal molecules such as acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). Other bacteria inhibit QS through the inactivation of AHL signals by producing enzymes like AHL-lactonases and -acylases. Comparative genomic analysis has revealed the multiplicity of genes for AHL lactonases (up to 12 copies per genome) among Bacillus spp. and that of AHL-acylases (up to 5 copies per genome) among Pseudomonas spp. This genetic evolution can be envisaged to enable host to withstand the attacks from bacterial population, which regulates its functioning through QS."

abstract,"Abstract Kongsfjorden is a glacial fjord in the Arctic that is influenced by both Atlantic and Arctic water masses. In the present report retrievable heterotrophic bacteria isolated from two distinct zones (outer and inner fjord) of Kongsfjorden was studied during summer to fall of 2012. 16S rRNA gene sequences of the retrievable heterotrophic bacteria corresponded to γ-proteobacteria (13 phylotypes), α-proteobacteria (3 phylotypes), Bacteroidetes (4 phylotypes) and Actinobacteria (2 phylotypes). The heterotrophic bacterial community structure was fundamentally different in different months which could be linked to changes in the water masses and/or phytoplankton bloom dynamics. It is hypothesized that monitoring the retrievable heterotrophic bacterial assemblage in the fjord would give valuable insights into the complex ecological role they play under extreme and dynamic conditions."

abstract,"Abstract A rapid, sensitive and validated method for the determination of fusaric acid (FA) in several Fusarium strains and different commercial food and feed products is reported based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography. This method requires only crude sample by a simple extraction with methanol, and requires a very short time of 8 min for completion. Separation of FA was performed at injection volume of 1 μl with a 20:80 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mobile phase containing 0.1 % formic acid at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min and detected with UV at 220 nm. Nice linearity and good correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.99) were obtained in the concentration range of 1–200 μg/ml. Validation was demonstrated using blank samples spiked at three different concentrations with standard solution, and the method yielded more than 98.2 % recovery efficiencies and below 2.56 % R.S.D. when applied in the analysis of FA produced by Fusarium verticillioides and a set of transgenic strains of this fungus. Satisfactory recoveries in the range of 79.1–105.8 % and R.S.D lower than 10 % were also obtained for the tested commercial food and feed products. The concentration FA detection in the transgenic strains ranged from 9.65 to 135 μg/kg (0.29–4.05 μg per gram of biomass). However, FA was not detected in most of the commercial products with the exception of niblet, oatmeal, red kidney bean and soybean, for which the concentrations of FA ranged from 2.5 to 18 μg/kg (below the permitted maximum). These results show that the proposed method has a great potential application to analyze FA from different sources rapidly."

abstract,"Abstract Activated sludge is an artificial ecosystem known to harbor complex microbial communities. Bacterial diversity in activated sludge from pulp and paper industry was studied to bioprospect for laccase, the multicopper oxidase applicable in a large number of industries due to its ability to utilize a wide range of substrates. Bacterial diversity using 454 pyrosequencing and laccase diversity using degenerate primers specific to conserved copper binding domain of laccase like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes were investigated. 1231 OTUs out of 11,425 sequence reads for bacterial diversity and 11 OTUs out of 15 reads for LMCO diversity were formed. Phylum Proteobacteria (64.95 %) with genus Thauera (13.65 %) was most abundant followed by phylum Bacteriodetes (11.46 %) that included the dominant genera Paludibacter (1.93 %) and Lacibacter (1.32 %). In case of LMCOs, 40 % sequences showed affiliation with Proteobacteria and 46.6 % with unculturable bacteria, indicating considerable novelty, and 13.3 % with Bacteroidetes. LMCOs belonged to H and J families."

abstract,"Abstract A polyaromatic hydrocarbon degrading bacterium was isolated from a petroleum contaminated site and designated as Stenotrophomonas sp. strain IITR87. It was found to utilize pyrene, phenanthrene and benzo(a)pyrene as sole carbon source, but not anthracene, chrysene and fluoranthene. Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy analysis resulted in identification of pyrene metabolites namely monohydroxypyrene, 4-oxa-pyrene-5-one, dimethoxypyrene and monohydroxyphenanthrene. Southern hybridization using naphthalene dioxygenase gene (nidA) as probe against the DNA of strain IITR87 revealed the presence of nidA gene. PCR analysis suggests dispersed occurrence of nid genes in the genome instead of a cluster as reported in a PAH-degrading Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1. The nid genes in strain IITR87, dioxygenase large subunit (nidA), naphthalene dioxygenase small subunit (nidB) and aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (nidD) showed more than 97 % identity to the reported nid genes from Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1. Most significantly, the biodegradation of PAHs was enhanced 25–60 % in the presence of surfactants rhamnolipid and Triton X-100 due to increased solubilization and bioavailability. These results could be useful for the improved biodegradation of high-molecular-weight PAHs in contaminated habitats."

abstract,"Abstract This study aimed to improve microbial flocculant production by optimizing the components of a Bacillus subtilis CZ1003 culture medium. Using the flocculation rate as the dependent variable, single-factor experiments were performed and beef extract at a concentration of 9 g/L was found to be the optimal nitrogen source, while glucose at a concentration of 20 g/L was the optimal carbon source. KCl, MgCl2, NaCl, and CaCl2 at concentrations of 0.75, 2.5, 0.5, and 5.0 g/L, respectively, were the optimum inorganic salts, in order of flocculant production activity. Orthogonal experimental demonstrated that KCl played a dominant role for Bacillus subtilis production of bioflocculants, followed by NaCl and CaCl2. Optimization experiments demonstrated that the optimal combination of the two salts was 0.75 g/L KCl and 0.5 g/L NaCl, resulting in a flocculation rate of 36.2% when included together at these concentrations. The final optimized medium consisted of 20 g/L glucose, 9 g/L beef extract, 0.75 g/L KCl, and 0.5 g/L NaCl. Compared with the initial medium, the optimized medium enhanced the flocculation activity from 12.1 to 36.2%, which equates to an increase of 199.17%. Meanwhile, the flocculant yield was increased from 0.058 g/L to 0.134/L, an increase of 131.03%. The optimized medium could be used to improve microbial flocculant production and provides a basis for further exploration."

abstract,"Abstract Biological nitrogen fixation is one of the most important nutrient processes in the ecosystem. Many studies have estimated the variations in soil diazotrophic communities across the globe. To understand the dynamics of nitrogen fixing bacterial communities and their response to the environmental changes, it is important to study the temporal variability of these communities. Using DNA fingerprinting method, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real time polymerase chain reaction of the nifH gene, we have found that the agricultural land harbored unique nitrogen fixing communities that revealed different temporal patterns and abundance. Variation in soil moisture, organic carbon content, ammonium and nitrate concentrations may be the main factors which influenced the diazotrophic community composition and nifH gene abundance. Azospirillum species were more dominant in the agricultural soil. Unique environmental factors and agricultural practices were responsible for the temporal shifts in bacterial community structures and nifH transcripts level. Our study expands understanding of the influence of environmental factors on diazotrophic population that contributes to the nitrogen pool."

abstract,"Abstract Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHAs) are natural, biodegradable biopolymers, which can be produced from renewable materials. PHAs have potential to replace petroleum derived plastics. Quite a few bacteria can produce PHA under nutritional stress. They generally produce homopolymers of butyrate i.e., polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), as a storage material. The biochemical characteristics of PHB such as brittleness, low strength, low elasticity, etc. make these unsuitable for commercial applications. Co-polymers of PHA, have high commercial value as they overcome the limitations of PHBs. Co-polymers can be produced by supplementing the feed with volatile fatty acids or through hydrolysates of different biowastes. In this review, we have listed the potential bacterial candidates and the substrates, which can be co-metabolized to produce PHA co-polymers."

abstract,Abstract An impedimetric mga gene specific DNA sensor was developed by immobilization of single stranded DNA probe onto the screen printed modified gold-dendrimer nanohybrid composite electrode for early and rapid detection of S. pyogenes in human throat swab samples causing rheumatic heart disease. Electrochemical impedance response was measured after hybridization with bacterial single stranded genomic DNA (ssG-DNA) with probe. The sensor was found highly specific to S. pyogenes and can detect as low as 0.01 ng ssDNA in 6 µL sample only in 30 min. The nanohybrid sensor was also tested with non-specific pathogens and characterized by FTIR. An early detection of the pathogen S. pyogenes in human can save damage of mitral and aortic heart valves (rheumatic heart disease) by proper medical care.

abstract,"Abstract Advancement in the next generation sequencing technologies has led to evolution of the field of genomics and metagenomics in a slim duration with nominal cost at precipitous higher rate. While metagenomics and genomics can be separately used to reveal the culture-independent and culture-based microbial evolution, respectively, (meta)genomics together can be used to demonstrate results at population level revealing in-depth complex community interactions for specific ecotypes. The field of metagenomics which started with answering “who is out there?” based on 16S rRNA gene has evolved immensely with the precise organismal reconstruction at species/strain level from the deeply covered metagenome data outweighing the need to isolate bacteria of which 99% are de facto non-cultivable. In this review we have underlined the appeal of metagenomic-derived genomes in providing insights into the evolutionary patterns, growth dynamics, genome/gene-specific sweeps, and durability of environmental pressures. We have demonstrated the use of culture-based genomics and environmental shotgun metagenome data together to elucidate environment specific genome modulations via metagenomic recruitments in terms of gene loss/gain, accessory and core-genome extent. We further illustrated the benefit of (meta)genomics in the understanding of infectious diseases by deducing the relationship between human microbiota and clinical microbiology. This review summarizes the technological advances in the (meta)genomic strategies using the genome and metagenome datasets together to increase the resolution of microbial population studies."

In this investigation, development of a Trichoderma viride–Mesorhizobium ciceri biofilmed inoculant was undertaken, which we hypothesized, would possess more effective biological nitrogen fixing ability and plant growth promoting properties. As a novel attempt, we selected Mesorhizobium ciceri spp. with good antifungal attributes with the assumption that such inoculants could also serve as biocontrol agents. These biofilms exhibited significant enhancement in several plant growth promoting attributes, including 13–21 % increase in seed germination, production of ammonia, IAA and more than onefold to twofold enhancement in phosphate solubilisation, when compared to their individual partners. Enhancement of 10–11 % in antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri was also recorded, over the respective M. ciceri counterparts. The effect of biofilms and the M. ciceri cultures individual on growth parameters of chickpea under pathogen challenged soil illustrated that the biofilms performed at par with the M. ciceri strains for most plant biometrical and disease related attributes. Elicitation of defense related enzymes like l-phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase was higher in M. ciceri/biofilm treated plants as compared to uninoculated plants under pathogen challenged soil. Further work on the signalling mechanisms among the partners and their tripartite interactions with host plant is envisaged in future studies."

abstract,"Abstract 
Virulence is described as an ability of an organism to infect the host and cause a disease. Virulence factors are the molecules that assist the bacterium colonize the host at the cellular level. These factors are either secretory, membrane associated or cytosolic in nature. The cytosolic factors facilitate the bacterium to undergo quick adaptive—metabolic, physiological and morphological shifts. The membrane associated virulence factors aid the bacterium in adhesion and evasion of the host cell. The secretory factors are important components of bacterial armoury which help the bacterium wade through the innate and adaptive immune response mounted within the host. In extracellular pathogens, the secretory virulence factors act synergistically to kill the host cells. In this review, we revisit the role of some of the secreted virulence factors of two human pathogens: Mycobacterium tuberculosis—an intracellular pathogen and Bacillus anthracis—an extracellular pathogen. The advances in research on the role of secretory factors of these pathogens during infection are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Assessment of biotic and abiotic degradation reactions by studying the variation in stable isotopic compositions of organic contaminants in contaminated soil and aquifers is being increasingly considered during the last two decades with development of Compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) technique. CSIA has been recognized as a potential tool for evaluating both qualitative and quantitative degradation with measurement of shifts in isotope ratios of contaminants and their degradation products as its basis. Amongst a wide variety of environmental pollutants including monoaromatics, chlorinated ethenes and benzenes etc., it is only recently that its efficacy is being tested for assessing biodegradation of a noxious pollutant namely hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), by pure microbial cultures as well as directly at the field site. Anticipating the increase in demand of this technique for monitoring the microbial degradation along with natural attenuation, this review highlights the basic problems associated with HCH contamination emphasizing the applicability of emerging CSIA technique to absolve the major bottlenecks in assessment of HCH. To this end, the review also provides a brief overview of this technique with summarizing the recent revelations put forward by both in vitro and in situ studies by CSIA in monitoring HCH biodegradation."

abstract,"Abstract Transmission of antibiotic resistance genes among Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococcus (BHS) was generally associated with transmissible genetic elements. The objectives of this study were to investigate carriage rate, antibiotic resistance and related mobile genetic elements of pneumococci and BHS from school-children. The pneumococci and BHS were recovered from 220 Thai school-children, and then tested for antibiotic susceptibility pattern by disc diffusion. Antibiotic resistance genes and related genetic elements were detected by PCR with specific primers. A total of 77 pneumococcal isolates were resistant to erythromycin (42 %), tetracycline (44 %), clindamycin (8 %), or penicillin (3 %). Fifty-four BHS isolates were resistant to erythromycin (28 %), tetracycline (52 %), or clindamycin (13 %). All isolates tested were 100 % sensitive to penicillin and levofloxacin. Among erythromycin-resistant streptococcal isolates showed different phenotypes of clindamycin resistance. It was found that isolated pneumococci showed constitutive clindamycin resistance (19 %), and inducible clindamycin resistance (12 %). The BHS isolates exhibited constitutive clindamycin resistance (40 %), and inducible resistance (20 %) phenotypes. The predominant erythromycin resistance genes in pneumococci and BHS were mefE and ermB, while the most common tetracycline resistance gene in this population was tetM. Furthermore, almost all erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant streptococci (97 %) mainly contained various genetic elements, including mega elements and six different transposon types (Tn2009, Tn2017, Tn917, Tn3872, Tn6002 and Tn916). Therefore, carriages of pneumococci and BHS with multidrug resistance in children might be important reservoirs of antibiotic-resistance genes carried by transposons. Tn916-like elements could lead to dissemination of the antibiotic resistance genes among genus streptococcus in human oral cavity and nasopharynx."

abstract,"Abstract The nut weevil (Curculio nucum) is one of the most important and widespread pests in hazelnut orchards. In order to screen entomopathogenic fungal strains with high virulence against C. nucum, the growth rate, sporulation, and cumulative mortality of different Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana strains were investigated, and the process by which M. anisopliae CoM 02 infects C. nucum larvae was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the growth rate and sporulation of different fungal strains significantly differed. Thirteen days after inoculation with M. anisopliae CoM 02, the cumulative mortality of C. nucum larvae reached 100 %, which was considerably higher than that of the other five strains. As the most virulent of the six test strains, the cadaver rate, LT50, and LT90 of M. anisopliae CoM 02 were 93.4 %, 7.05 and 11.90 days, respectively. Analysis of the infection process by scanning electron microscopy showed that the spore attachment, hyphal germination, hyphal rapid growth, and sporulation of M. anisopliae CoM 02 occurred on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 11th day after inoculation, respectively, indicating that the infection cycle takes approximately 11 days. This finding suggests that the highly virulent M. anisopliae plays an important role in the biocontrol of C. nucum in China."

abstract,"Abstract 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (2,3-DBDO) is an extradiol-type dioxygenase that involved in third step of biphenyl degradation pathway. The nucleotide sequence of the bphC gene from Comamonas sp. SMN4, which encodes 2,3-DBDO with His-tag, was cloned into a plasmid pQE30 in E. coli. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified active 2,3-DBDO showed a single band around 33 kDa, corresponding the molecular mass of 2,3-DBDO subunit. Two fractions around 170 and 100 kDa were separated in gel filtration chromatography, but only former one (the fraction of 170 kDa) has 2,3-DBDO activity. The 2,3-DBDO was reported as the polymeric protein consisted of eight subunits. However, the fraction corresponding octameric protein of 2,3-DBDO was not found in the gel filtration chromatography. The 2,3-DBDO was exhibited the maximum activity at pH 9.0 and was stable at pH 8.0, relatively. The circular dichroism (CD) data showed that 2,3-DBDO had an α-helical folding structures at neutral pHs ranged from pH 4.5 to pH 9.0. However, this high stable folding structure was converted to unfolded structure in acidic region (pH 2.5) or in high pH (pH 12.0). The enzyme was thermally stable and active up to 40 °C. The conformational data by CD spectra were consistent with the stability of 2,3-DBDO by checking the activity. The binding affinity (K  m ) for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, 3-metylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol and catechol was 11.7, 24 μM, 50 mM and 625 μM, respectively."

abstract,"Abstract Since 2009, Aureococcus anophagefferens has caused brown tide to occur recurrently in Qinhuangdao coastal area, China. Because the algal cells of A. anophagefferens are so tiny (~3 µm) that it is very hard to identify exactly under a microscope for natural water samples, it is very urgent to develop a method for efficient and continuous monitoring. Here specific primers and Taqman probe are designed to develop a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for identification and quantification continually. The algal community and cell abundance of A. anophagefferens in the study area (E 119°20′–119°50′ and N 39°30′–39°50′) from April to October in 2013 are detected by pyrosequencing, and are used to validate the specification and precision of qPCR method for natural samples. Both pyrosequencing and qPCR shows that the targeted cells are present only in May, June and July, and the cell abundance are July > June > May. Although there are various algal species including dinoflagellata, diatom, Cryptomonadales, Chrysophyceae and Chlorophyta living in the natural seawater simultaneously, no disturbance happens to qPCR method. This qPCR method could detect as few as 10 targeted cells, indicating it is able to detect the algal cells at pre-bloom levels. Therefore, qPCR with Taqman probe provides a powerful and sensitive method to monitor the brown tide continually in Qinhuangdao coastal area, China. The results provide a necessary technology support for forecasting the brown tide initiation, in China."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of this study was to screen out a bacillus from Sichuan sun vinegar grains capable of producing a high total amount of flavonoids and total phenols. Forty-eight strains were initially screened out from Sichuan sun vinegar grains. The sodium nitrite-aluminum nitrate-sodium hydroxide colorimetry method was used to determine the total flavonoids, and the Folin-phenol method was used to determine the total phenols. Based on the results of total flavonids and total phenol producing capacities of the strains, one strain was singled out for use in this study. This strain, which was named YB-19, is capable of producing a total amount of 96.55 μg/mL flavonoids and 86.69 μg/mL phenols. YB-19 was identified by its strain morphology, physiological and biochemical characteristics. DNA sequencing was performed on YB-19. The results of the DNA sequencing showed that the sequence similarity between strain YB-19 and Bacillus toyonensis strain BCT-7112 was 99 %, and the two strains were housed on the same branch in the phylogenetic tree. Combined with the results of the strain morphology and the observed physiological and biochemical characteristics, YB-19 was identified as B. toyonensis. The screened strain YB-19 can be applied to the traditional brewing process of sun vinegar to improve vinegar quality and to enrich the microbial resources for vinegar fermentation."

abstract,"Abstract  Polymyxa graminis, a root endoparasite of several cereal species, is considered to be non-pathogenic but serves as a vector of various plant viruses belonging to the genera Bymovirus, Furovirus, and Pecluvirus. Specifically, it reduces barley productivity by transmitting the Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus (BaYMV). To date, due to its obligate biotrophic property, no artificial culturing of P. graminis was reported and its quantification was also technically challenging. Here, we developed a novel and simple method to infect P. graminis within sterile barley roots in contamination free by preparing nearly pure zoospore inoculum. Such artificial maintenance of P. graminis was verified based on the presence of various developmental stages in infected barley roots under microscope. In addition, the population of resting spores in host tissue was determined by establishing standard curve between manually counted number of spores and Ct values of 18S rDNA amplification using quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, it was validated that standard curve generated was also applicable to estimate the abundance of P. graminis in soil environments. In conclusion, the present study would help to generate a system to investigate the etiological causes as well as management of plant diseases caused by P. graminis and BaYMV in tissue and soil."

abstract,"Abstract Tissue isolation from mushrooms is frequently practiced by both researchers and growers to isolate new and improved strains. In the present study, we designed a simple and convenient device for precise tissue isolation and therefore investigated the effect of tissue size on mycelial growth of seven mushroom species. The developed device consists of a cutting needle and a transfer needle. The cutting needle was used to obtain circular tissue plugs having a height up to 3 mm and variable diameters (2–5 mm) from mushroom fruit bodies. The transfer needle was a stainless steel round rod (1.5 mm in diameter) with a blade-like end. It can be used for collecting mushroom tissue when the cutting needle fails to extract it. With the aid of these devices, precise tissue isolation was achieved. Plate cultures demonstrated that tissue size had little effect on mycelium extension for Lentinula edodes (the winter shiitake), Hypsizygus marmoreus, and Agrocybe aegerita, but influenced the aerobic mycelium density. For Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus eryngii, and Volvariella volvacea, large tissue plugs produced faster mycelial growth and higher aerobic mycelium density compared with small ones. On the contrary, small plugs from the tissue of the flower shiitake and Agaricus bisporus favored mycelial growth. The present study revealed that the preferable tissue size for mycelial growth varies among mushroom species, and the developed device is expected to greatly facilitate the isolation of new and improved mushroom strains."

abstract,"Abstract Cell biomass and metal salt concentration have great influence on morphology of biosynthesized nanoparticle. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of varying cell density and gold salt concentrations on synthesis of nanoparticles and its morphology, which has not been studied in bacteria till now. When cells of Acinetobacter sp. SW30 were incubated with different cell density and gold chloride concentrations, tremendous variation in color of colloidal solution containing gold nanoparticles (AuNP) was observed indicating variation in their size and shapes. Surprisingly, monodispersed spherical AuNP of size ~19 nm were observed at lowest cell density and HAuCl4 salt concentration while increase in cell number resulted in formation of polyhedral AuNP (~39 nm). Significance of this study lays in the fact that the shape and dispersity of AuNP can be customized depending up on the requirement. FTIR spectrum revealed shift from 3221 to 3196 cm−1 indicating the presence and role of amino acids in Au3+ reduction while possible involvement of amide I and II groups in stabilization of AuNP. The rate constant was calculated for cell suspension of 2.1 × 109 cfu/ml challenged with 1.0 mM HAuCl4, incubated at 30 °C and pH 7 using the slopes of initial part of the plot log (Aα − At) versus time as 1.99 × 10−8 M.

abstract,"Abstract Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase are considered the most important antioxidant enzymes which protect fungus from the oxidant damage of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we collected 44 strains of Trichosporon asahii (T. asahii) from different sources and investigated their SOD and catalase activities. The results showed that the SOD and catalase activities of Clinical group were significantly higher than those of Environment group (p < 0.01). The SOD and catalase activities of T. asahii in Internal passage group went up gradually after passage in mice, and were significantly higher in 5th generation of Internal passage group (p < 0.05). The SOD and catalase activities of Fluconazole-resistant group strains also increased after resistant induction, and the SOD and catalase activities were significantly higher in the 10th generation of Fluconazole-resistant group (p < 0.05). This implied that T. asahii has stronger antioxidant ability. The strains of T. asahii from different sources have different antioxidant abilities, which mainly manifest in the difference of antioxidant enzymatic activities. Clinical group strains have the strongest antioxidant capacity; Internal passage group strains and Fluconazole resistant group strains better; Environmental group strains the lowest. These results also suggested that the antioxidant defensive response of T. asahii might be relevant to its infection mechanism and drug resistance mechanism."

abstract,"Abstract Mercury (Hg) is one of the most toxic heavy metal and is extremely harmful for the environment. The permissible limit of mercury in industrial effluents is 0.001 ppm, whereas there are various sites having very high levels of mercury contamination. In the present study, 10 different mercury (Hg) resistant bacterial strains were isolated from Ulhas Estuary, Mumbai (Hg concentration of 107 ppm). All the strains were subsequently grown on higher concentration of mercuric chloride (HgCl2), one of the isolate (USP5) showed significant growth at high concentration of Hg (40 ppm) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed the identity of the bacterium as Methylotenera mobilis, (Accession no. KT714144). The mer operon was isolated and cloned in E.coli and checked for its ability to tolerate higher concentration of Hg. It has shown growth up to 70 ppm of Hg, also presence of merA gene indicated its ability to detoxify Hg into less toxic volatile form. The atomic absorption spectrophotometry confirmed the ability of clone to efficiently detoxify 60–90 % of the Hg (10–70 ppm) within 48–72 h. This clone can be used for effective volatilization of Hg from contaminated areas."

abstract,"Abstract Gay and bisexual men may form chosen families in addition to or in place of families of origin. However, the characteristics of these diverse families remain largely unexamined in the quantitative literature. The purpose of this study was to develop a family typology based on responses from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adult gay and bisexual men (YGBM) recruited from the Detroit Metropolitan Area (N = 350; 18–29 years old). To explore the role of family, we examined family social support and social undermining in relation to YGBM psychological distress within different family types. A series of multivariate regressions were used to examine associations between family social support and social undermining with depression and anxiety outcomes. The majority (88%) of YGBM included family of origin in their definitions of family and 63% indicated having chosen families. Associations between family social processes and psychological outcomes varied by type of family, suggesting that family composition shapes how perceptions of support and undermining relate to experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Chosen families play a prominent role in the lives of YGBM and should not be overlooked in family research. Findings also highlight the importance of examining co-occurring family social support and social stress processes to further address psychological distress symptoms among YGBM."

abstract,"Abstract Literature on homophobic bullying underlines that many teachers do not intervene in this kind of issue and often underestimate this type of bullying. At the same time, the protective role of teachers’ support for victimized students is well recognized. The present study aims to understand the processes that can lead to teachers’ activation against homophobic bullying. Two hundred and thirteen teachers belonging to different schools in Rome completed an anonymous questionnaire that assessed (a) reactions to homophobic bullying (feeling of powerlessness and positive activations), (b) homophobic attitudes, (c) teachers’ general perceived self-efficacy, and (d) perceived self-efficacy in managing homophobic bullying incidents. We used a structural equation model to test whether self-efficacy, both as a teacher and in managing homophobic bullying incidents, predicts both aspects of teachers’ reactions to homophobic bullying, controlling for homophobic attitudes. We found that lower levels of perceived self-efficacy in managing homophobic bullying incidents and higher levels of homophobic attitudes predict stronger feeling of powerlessness, while higher levels of perceived self-efficacy as a teacher and lower levels of homophobic attitudes predict stronger positive activation toward the victimized student. Theoretical and practical implications are provided."

abstract,"Abstract Despite high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), little is known about their experiences with diagnosis, treatment, and reinfection. To fill this gap, we interviewed 17 YMSM ages 18–29 who participated in an online HIV prevention trial and tested positive for STIs at both the baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Participants were asked about their reactions to testing positive, experiences with treatment, disclosure to partners, and changes in thinking and behavior. Reactions were diverse, the most common being surprise and concern. Most participants sought treatment, although type of provider varied (e.g., primary care physician, clinic that specialized in gay/bisexual men’s health). Providers tended to retest participants, but some did so at the incorrect anatomical site. Participants who felt comfortable talking to providers about STIs tended to use their regular provider or one who specialized in gay/bisexual men’s health. Most participants described changes in their thinking and behavior (e.g., increased condom use, fewer sex partners, questioning whether or not they could trust their partners). Most participants disclosed to at least one partner, but some did not remember or were not in contact with partners. Experiences were similar the first and second time participants tested positive for STIs during the study with a few exceptions (e.g., more self-blame and comfort talking to providers the second time). In sum, YMSM have diverse experiences with STI diagnosis and treatment. Implications for public policy and STI prevention are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ) adolescents experience higher rates of negative sexual health outcomes relative to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. Healthy parent-adolescent relationships and effective parenting are robust predictors of sexual health in heterosexual adolescents, but very little is known about barriers to and facilitators of effective parenting from the perspective of parents of LGBTQ adolescents. This study conducted online focus groups with 44 parents of LGBTQ adolescents in order to describe the factors influencing effective sexual health communication and parental monitoring in this population. Parents described generally positive relationships with teens, but many noted they went through a transition process in which they struggled with their child’s identity and were less supportive of their LGBTQ teen. Lack of understanding about LGBTQ-specific sexuality was a commonly endorsed barrier to effective communication, and this was most commonly endorsed by parents of cisgender girls. Parents of cisgender boys and transgender/gender-nonconforming teens described fears about long-term sexual health (i.e., sexual predators, consent) as a barrier to parental monitoring. Parents of LGBTQ adolescents need information and skills to optimize their teen’s sexual health. Parent-based programs for LGBTQ adolescents are long overdue for addressing these issues."

While researchers have explored consequences for sexting, less is known about the challenges adolescents face when making decisions about sending photographs. Using online personal accounts posted by adolescents, this study explores young women’s reported dilemmas with sending nude photographs to their peers. A thematic analysis of 462 stories reveals that young women received conflicting messages which told them both to send and refrain from sending photographs. In addition to sending photographs in the hope of gaining a relationship, young women also reported sending photographs as the result of coercion by male counterparts in the form of persistent requests, anger, and threats. Young women attempted to navigate young men’s coercive behaviors yet frequently resorted to compliance. Refusal was often met with repeated requests or threats. Alternative tactics were largely absent from young women’s stories, indicating that young women do not have tools to successfully navigate the challenges they face."

A harm reduction and strength-based approach is utilized to connect HIV+ individuals with medical care and other services while ensuring housing stability. An intensive case management team provides support such as home visits, case monitoring, accompaniment to appointments, and referrals to health and social service resources within the community. This program evaluation used clinical data mining (CDM) to implement a Return-on-Investment (ROI) analysis of the STARS supportive housing program. The evaluation compared program costs to “services as usual” through the NYC shelter system. The STARS program served 27 individuals, achieving 25 successful outcomes, during 3 years. The program’s total value (savings relative to shelter costs) yielded a 1.32 ROI. The results support practice and policy advocacy initiatives promoting supportive housing and housing first initiatives as a viable method to reduce homelessness and as a structural intervention to improve health outcomes for young people with HIV."

We conducted a mixed-methods study on emerging adults’ (N = 441) beliefs about the ideal age and frequency for parents to discuss sex-related topics, and about their parents’ strengths and weaknesses in sexual communication. Most participants reported that parents should talk about sex frequently, early, and on a wide variety of topics. They also recommended parents to be open, honest, and realistic when talking to their children about sex. We discuss implications for how to reposition parents to engage in successful sexual communication, and thus improve sexual health and well-being for young people."

abstract,"Abstract Cell phone-based dating applications (apps) are increasingly popular in the USA. However, there is a paucity of research regarding dating app use among young heterosexual adults. This study examined the prevalence of dating application use and its connections with sexual behavior among young heterosexual adults. Five hundred nine heterosexual cisgender undergraduate students aged 18–25 completed an online survey assessing trait impulsivity, dating app use and motivations for using dating apps, sexual behavior, and demographics. 39.5% of the participants reported using dating apps. Individuals who used dating apps had higher rates of sexual risk behaviors in the past 3 months, including sex after using drugs or alcohol, and unprotected sex (anal or vaginal), and more lifetime sexual partners. When controlling for demographics and impulsivity, individuals who used dating applications were twice as likely to have had unprotected sex in the past 3 months, but were not significantly more likely to have had multiple partners within the past 3 months. In an exploratory analysis controlling for demographics and impulsivity, dating app use predicted the number of lifetime sexual partners. This study documented an association between dating app use and sexual risk behaviors among young heterosexual adults. Results  suggest potential targets for intervention, including interventions that address sexual health information, and the dissemination of sexual health information through dating apps themselves."

abstract,"Abstract The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups."

abstract,"Abstract This study determines how transgender involvement in survival economies, namely sex work and drug sales, affects transgender experiences of service provider discrimination, in comparison to discrimination experienced by transgender people not involved in survival economies. It utilizes cross-sectional data from the 2008–2009 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS). Multivariate logistic regression is conducted on the sample (n = 4927) to determine the strength of association. Logistic regression sub-analysis is used to compare discrimination across different service provider contexts. Compared to those not participating in survival economies, participating in sex work has almost three times greater odds (OR 2.83, CI 2.20–3.63), and those participating in drug sales have approximately 1.5 greater odds (OR 1.52, CI 1.16–1.99), of experiencing discrimination from service providers. Participation in survival economies is a significant predictor of a transgender person’s increased likelihood of experiencing service provider discrimination. Findings suggest that service providers must attend to the specificity of transgender experiences in survival economies. Harm reduction is offered as a suitable intervention approach."

This study drew on data from the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, a nationally representative survey of people in Great Britain. Logistic regression was undertaken to examine firstly the relationships between WSW and women who have sex exclusively with men (WSEM) and their main source of information about sex, and secondly between WSW/WSEM and unmet need for information about sex. Each source was included as the binary outcome indicating yes as this was the main source, or no as this was not the main source of information about sex. The results found that WSW had significantly lower odds of reporting lessons at schools as their main source of information and significantly higher odds of reporting sources defined as ‘other’ (predominantly first girlfriend/boyfriend or sexual partner) as their main source of information. Reported levels of unmet need for information were also higher among young WSW compared with WSEM. This study provides new insights into the sex educational needs of young women and highlights the need for sex education in schools in Great Britain to include information on a full range of sexual practices, including same-sex sexual relationships."

abstract,"Abstract The US public attitudes toward abortion have been studied extensively, but little is known about these attitudes among women who seek abortion. This mixed-methods study explores women’s attitudes about abortion after receiving or being denied an abortion. Data are from the Turnaway Study, a prospective, longitudinal study of women seeking abortions at 30 US facilities. Participants presented just before a facility’s gestational limit and received abortions or just beyond the limit and were denied abortions. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we assessed 812 participants’ attitudes about abortion over 5 years. At 5 years after abortion seeking, we conducted in-depth interviews with 31 participants; this analysis includes the comments of 19 participants who discussed their abortion attitudes in those interviews. We find that 6 months after abortion seeking, nearly all women supported abortion legality in all (80%) or some (18%) situations, yet 20% also believed abortion is morally wrong. Women denied an abortion were significantly less likely to support the legal right to abortion at 6 months (62%) and 4.5 years (77%) after abortion seeking than women who had received a near-limit abortion (78 and 88%, respectively). In open-ended interviews, women expressed nuanced views, including reporting increased empathy for others facing an unwanted pregnancy. Women’s own reproductive experiences impact their views on abortion. Distinguishing between morality and legality of abortion is critical in understanding abortion attitudes."

history,['2018-03-14']
abstract,"Abstract This paper uses data from a study of 105 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people to examine conceptions of family in LGBT communities. Respondents were asked how they would define “family” and whom they consider to be their current family. The study sought to determine whether constructionist definitions of family (“families of choice”) remain dominant among LGBT people. Earlier research had clearly established the importance of friends as chosen family in this population, but a growing emphasis on same-sex marriage and increased gay and lesbian parenting might be expected to cause some LGBT people to shift toward more traditional definitions of family. Results  show that constructionist definitions remain prominent in abstract conceptions of family, but also that LGBT people frequently define biological and legal relatives as members of their current family, and few define their current family as only consisting of chosen family. The notion of families of choice continues to resonate, but chosen family members mostly complement rather than replace other kinds of family in definitions of one’s current family."

abstract,"Abstract State governments in the US continue to pass legislation restricting access to abortion, suggesting that public opinion supports increased restriction. Research assessing the extent to which people’s abortion opinions are complex and nuanced (i.e., people’s opinions deviate from strictly pro-choice/pro-life stances) is lacking. Using an explanatory, sequential mixed-methods research design, the current study explores the complexity in people’s abortion opinions via two studies. Study 1 demonstrates the need for a more nuanced understanding of abortion attitudes, while Study 2 provides an initial assessment of potential complexity in people’s attitudes toward abortion. In Study 1, data from the General Social Survey (n = 1572) were used to examine responses to six abortion scenarios and assess demographic characteristics predictive of abortion opinions and complexity. In Study 2, surveys were administered to college students (n = 483) residing in politically conservative states asking about abortion self-identification and circumstances under which women should/should not have access. Data were analyzed using an inductive coding approach. According to Study 1, education, religious affiliation, living in a rural setting, and political affiliation were significantly related to abortion opinions and abortion complexity. According to Study 2, participants’ responses ranged widely. Pro-choice and pro-life identifying individuals cited numerous circumstances under which they believed women should/should not have access to abortion. Findings suggest that abortion opinions are highly complex and contextual. Although most recent legislation regarding abortion restricts and/or eliminates access, the majority of individuals remain somewhat or mostly in favor of access."

abstract,"Abstract Drawing on an interview-based study with indoor-based sex workers of different genders in Great Britain, this paper explores the disparity between dominant policy representations of sex workers and the working lives of people selling intimate services. I argue certain policy discourses reinforce narratives of vulnerability and coercion when discussing female sex workers and responses to perceived ‘problems’ of prostitution and neglect the needs of male and transgender sex workers. I contrast messages in policy discourses with the experiences of sex workers across indoor sectors. My study found considerable diversity in working experiences, influenced by factors such as work setting, personal circumstances and aspirations. While some people may view sex work as a short-term option, for others it represents a longer-term career. For some, sex work may offer greater job satisfaction and control over working conditions than other jobs available. Nonetheless, external constraints sometimes make it difficult for them to work safely. I argue state discourses fail to reflect the diverse experiences of sex workers and undermine their agency, perpetuating disrespect and excluding them from human and labour rights. I suggest the need to consider policy approaches shaped according to varied circumstances and settings, drawing on the expertise of sex workers."

abstract,"Abstract Despite the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue (DADT) and the update to the Transgender Policy, there remain concerns about the persistence of military sexual trauma (MST) and sexual orientation discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) service members. A sample of 253 participants (89 women, 164 men) completed an Internet-based survey that assessed the prevalence of sexual orientation discrimination (e.g., offensive speech, physical or discriminatory behaviors) and MST (e.g., sexual harassment and sexual assault). The survey was conducted between April 2012 and October 2013. Women and men reported similar levels of sexual orientation discrimination in the military. Participants reported experiencing more threats and intimation, vandalism, and physical assault outside of the military than inside the military (p < 0.05). Although the prevalence of MST (both sexual harassment and sexual assault) in the military was high among both genders, women were more likely to report experiences of sexual harassment compared to men (p < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of MST and sexual orientation discrimination among LGBT service members in the military and point to the need for strong accountability and oversight to protect sexual minority persons while they are serving their country."

abstract,"Abstract Gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, “top” (e.g., chest reconstruction surgery) and “bottom” (e.g., vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, etc.) surgeries, and puberty blockers, is an efficacious treatment of gender dysphoria for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals. However, many TGNC people encounter significant barriers in accessing gender-affirming care, which we detail via results from on online study. Participants included 256 TGNC individuals (78.9% White, ages 16–73, M age = 28.4). Among participants, 61.3% were receiving hormone therapy, 22.7% had undergone top surgery, and 5.5% had undergone bottom surgery. Open-ended responses (n = 201) were thematically analyzed and common barriers included finances and insurance issues, a lack of service availability, and fears or worries. Participants reported various systemic issues and incidents of bias within medical and mental health fields, as well as a lack of medical provider awareness and education. Other themes were interpersonal barriers (e.g., fears of rejection); age and need of parental consent for minors; other medical issues; and a lack of information about how to acquire care. These findings can be utilized to educate professionals in medical and mental health fields about barriers their TGNC patients may encounter in receiving affirming care and suggest a number of ways to improve access to these services."

abstract,"Abstract In this article, I analyze the state and federal court cases that established same-sex marriage rights in the USA, from Massachusetts in 2003 to the Supreme Court in 2015. Using content analysis, I examine the legal rhetorics deployed in favor of and against same-sex marriage, focusing on how courts interpreted both sides’ appeals to children’s wellbeing. Such appeals represent a political tactic Lee Edelman (2004) terms “reproductive futurism.” Four child-focused arguments routinely appear in these cases: opponents claim that (1) heterosexual marriage provides an optimal environment for childrearing and (2) marriage is designed to incentivize commitment for sexually irresponsible straight couples via procreative channeling; proponents respond that (3) gay and lesbian couples are just as good as straight couples at raising children and (4) gay marriage bans harm same-sex couples’ children by making them second-class citizens. I argue that the latter “children first” positions emerged—in both proponents’ arguments and court rulings—as a response to opponents’ claims and to the structural constraints of the legal system. This narrowed line of argumentation simultaneously paved the way to legal victory while also limiting the rulings’ usefulness for advancing LGBT rights beyond marriage."

abstract,"Abstract Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants’ attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women."

We conducted an internet-based study and gathered both qualitative and quantitative data from a national convenience sample to examine how sexual minority women and gender minorities (n = 741) perceived the outcome of the election in relation to stigma-related concerns, perceptions, and expectations. Quantitative analyses of responses collected between December 2016 and the presidential inauguration (January 20, 2017) revealed that participants reported high levels of election outcome-related concerns, including psychological and emotional distress. Qualitative responses centered on the individual-level impacts of the perceived threat of potential increases in structural stigma. Participants raised specific concerns about the possible rollback of rights and the rise in hate speech and discrimination, and the stigmatizing effects of these on LGBTQ and other marginalized populations."

abstract,"Abstract The objective of this study was to document the prevalence and evolution of sexual prejudice toward gay men and lesbian, same-gender marriage, and same-gender parenting among a large sample of Portuguese young adults. The sample consisted of 704 self-identified heterosexual individuals (24% men and 76% women), aged between 18 and 30 years (M = 22; SD = 3), who participated in an online survey. ANOVA results revealed that women were less sexually prejudiced, were less likely to endorse social etiological beliefs of homosexuality, and were more supportive of same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting than were men. Further mediation analysis revealed that the effects of gender, religiosity, importance of religious beliefs, and political leaning on the support for same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting were partially mediated by etiological beliefs and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The complexity of attitudes toward same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting was highlighted, indicating how attitudes toward gay men and lesbians and the belief that homosexuality is controllable impact on the support for same-gender parented families. These results are important to inform affirmative polities designed to correct inequalities and recognize same-gender families."

abstract,"Abstract The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the effects of legal name change on socioeconomic factors, general and transgender-related health care access and utilization, and transgender-related victimization in a sample of young transgender women (transwomen) of color. A cross-sectional group comparison approach was used to assess the potential effects of legal name change. A convenience sample of young transwomen enrolled in a no-cost legal name change clinic were recruited to complete a 30-min interviewer-guided telephone survey including sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, health and well-being, health care utilization, transgender transition-related health care, and transgender-related victimization. Sixty-five transgender women of color (37 = pre-name change group, 28 = post-name change group) completed the survey. Results  indicated that the transwomen in the post-name change group were significantly older than the pre-name change group. In age-adjusted analyses, the post-name change group was significantly more likely to have a higher monthly income and stable housing than the pre-name change group. No significant differences were observed for general health care utilization; however, a significantly greater percentage of transwomen in the pre-name change group reported postponing medical care due to their gender identity. In addition, a significantly larger proportion of transwomen in the pre-name change group reported using non-prescribed hormones injected by friends and experiencing verbal harassment by family and friends compared to transwomen in the post-name change group. Findings suggest that legal name change may be an important structural intervention for low-income transwomen of color, providing increased socioeconomic stability and improved access to primary and transition-related health care."

abstract,"Abstract This study examined the prevalence and forms of sexual behavior in a sample of sexual minority women (SMW) with a history of experiencing discrimination. One hundred fifty ethnically diverse lesbian, bisexual, queer, and other non-heterosexual-identified cisgender women completed a national online survey. Rates of sexual behavior over the past 6 months were high, including having sex with someone who had had many sexual partners (40.7%), engaging in cunnilingus without protection (64%), and having sex under the influence of substances (56.7%). A canonical correlation found that heterosexist experiences and sexual behaviors had 20.7% overlapping variance. Experiences of heterosexism by individuals in service jobs, strangers, or those in helping professions were tied to engagement in more impulsive sexual behaviors. Multiple linear regressions found that heterosexism explained 19.3% of the variance in impulsive sexual behaviors, 8.6% in sex with uncommitted partners, and 8.8% in intent to engage in sexual behaviors. Despite the high rates of sexual behavior found in this study, a focus on sexual behaviors among SMW has largely been omitted from health research. Based on the current findings, interventions for addressing sexual behaviors in SMW as well as future research directions are discussed."

How the values related to hyper-masculinity and heteronormativity influence the experiences of gay and lesbian soldiers is an empirical question. In the present study, the Psycho-Social Ethnography of the Commonplace (P-SEC; Gouliquer & Poulin, 2005) methodology was used to investigate how the institutions of heterosexuality and the Canadian military shape gay and lesbian soldiers’ experiences. Interviews with 10 lesbian and 10 gay soldiers were conducted and analysed. The findings reveal that lesbian and gay soldiers face fairly widespread discrimination in the military environment. They must contend with the institutional demands to meet the requirements of a hyper-masculine-heteronormative soldier ideal. Gender differences are highlighted and social policy recommendations are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds in Australia are recognised as under-utilising mainstream sexual and reproductive health care. A qualitative study was undertaken in Sydney, Australia, to explore the complexities and opportunities for engaging young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds with sexual and reproductive health information and care. Several rounds of interviews were undertaken with 27 migrant and refugee young people aged 16–24 years. These included an initial semi-structured interview (n = 27) and a follow-up and/or walking interview with a sub-set of participants (n = 9 and n = 15 respectively). A theme of ‘generational difference’ recurred throughout the interviews. Particular ways of talking about age-related differences, including the ‘young generation’ and ‘older generations’, appeared to be deployed as a mechanism for explaining a perceived disjunction between service providers and young people. This group, from a very diverse range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds, appeared to be more similar than different when talking about sexual health. They saw themselves as generationally distinct, and commonly positioned ‘older people’ as judgemental and less accepting in relation to sexual health. Migrant and refugee young people may not be fully engaged with, or benefitting from, sexual and reproductive health services, despite a number of service options being available. It is likely that their perceptions and previous experiences, as well as stated preferences for services and service providers, would affect their willingness to engage with services. To enable information and services to better reach young people across the many cultural and linguistic groups living in contemporary Australia, attention must be paid to ensuring they feel included as a member of a ‘young generation’, and ensuring services are inclusive and welcoming."

Andersen’s (1967) behavioral health model was used to predict healthcare utilization. A hierarchical logistic regression was conducted to predict MHC, in the past year (12) and during their lifetime (L). Both models were significant: for MHC-L, (χ 2 (6) = 41.57, p < .001), and for MHC-12 (χ 2 (6) = 53.26, p < .001). Both models had previous mental health diagnosis and disclosure of sexual orientation status as significant predictors. Individuals who more openly disclosed sexual orientation status were more likely to have used mental health services. Implications and limitations to the study are discussed."

Exploring the ways in which FSWs enact agency in risk environments can illustrate how environmental characteristics shape perceived risks and the strategies that FSWs develop to manage them. This approach also identifies the limits that are placed by environmental characteristics over the capacity for harm reduction and prevention practices among FSWs. We analyzed the role of agency in the work environments of female sex workers and its relationship with risk perception and management in the cities of Tijuana and Cd. Juárez."

Focusing on the way (host) cities shape sex work both imaginatively and physically, we explore the (lived) realities of neoliberal imaginaries that shape urban space. Often thought to exist in the urban shadow as an absent-presence in cosmopolitan processes, we demonstrate the manner in which sexualized and racialized women creatively resist the political and economic trajectories of neoliberal urbanism that seek to expropriate land and dispossess certain bodies. In the context of Rio de Janeiro—as in other host cities—this is particularly evident in the routine encounter between sexual minorities and local law enforcement. Mindful of the literature on state incursion into social-sexual life, we remain attentive to the everyday strategies through which those deemed sexually deviant and/or victim navigate local authorities in search of new opportunities for economic salvation in the midst of the sport mega-event."

abstract,"Abstract The adolescent population is considered a group that is at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or HIV. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the sexual behavior (both coital and non-coital) of Spanish adolescents and the differences on the basis of gender. It was a representative sample of 2703 Spanish adolescents of between 14 and 20 years old. In total, 49.9% of participants were males (M = 15.95; SD = 1.30) and 51.1% females (M = 15.83; SD = 1.28). The results show that 27% of adolescents maintain penetrative sexual relations, 45.7% engage in non-penetrative sex, and 27.3% have never had sexual experience. On the basis of gender, males initiate non-penetrative sexual behavior, vaginal sex, and anal sex earlier than females, have a greater number of non-penetrative sexual encounters under the influence of alcohol and have a greater number of anal and vaginal sex partners. Females, on the other hand, tend to have partners who are older than them. No gender differences were found in the case of condom use in the first and last sexual contact with anal and vaginal penetration, or in the consistent use of condoms in anal and vaginal sexual encounters, of which it is particularly worth noting that 47.2% of adolescents use condoms inconsistently in vaginal sexual relations, and 81.9% in anal relations. It can be concluded that it is necessary to intervene and educate adolescents on the prevention of STIs/HIV at an early age, taking into account a gender perspective."

abstract,"Abstract Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) is the practice of providing patients diagnosed with bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) medication to give directly to their partner for treatment, which can result in missed opportunities for partner HIV testing. Fifteen STI clinic patients were asked about their opinions of including HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits with PDPT. Interview data fit well into constructs of the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model. Patients’ motivations to deliver HIVST kits to their partners included the importance of earlier identification of HIV, convenience, avoidance of STI clinic stigma, and empowerment of individual and partner protection against HIV. Patients described the need for more information with worries about the quality of the HIVST device and questions about how it worked. Patients worried about their partners’ reaction, including the potential for violence, and needed skills to support their partner with HIVST. Public health policies should support the inclusion of HIVST kits with PDPT, but additional intervention research is needed to more fully support patients and their partners with HIVST and PDPT."

Peer sexual communication quality improved across the college years, and tended to be higher during semesters when late adolescents held less conservative attitudes about sex and communicated about sex more frequently. Additionally, peer sexual communication quality was better among women and late adolescents who were sexually active at more semesters. We discuss implications for peer-led sexual health intervention programs and for theories of normative sexuality development."

abstract,"Abstract The attributional theory of stigma maintains that the rejection of the stigmatized group increases when attributions are made to controllable causes rather than to genetic factors. Our study has two objectives: one, to provide evidence for the bifactorial structure of the scale of Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS); and two, to carry out a direct replication of a previous experimental study about the effect of the etiology of the homosexual sexual orientation on attitudes toward same-sex parents. The sample was composed of 229 Spanish university students with a mean age of 26.18 years (SD = 9.43). This study demonstrates that the rejection of same-sex parents is greater when the homosexual sexual orientation is attributed to learning. The effect is observed in the scores on the two subscales: traditional rejection or individual opposition and modern rejection or normative opposition.

abstract,"Abstract In this article, we examine motherhood “scripts,” or cultural discourses, taught in prenatal classes in the US South. Our analysis revealed that these prenatal classes, all taught in the early 2000s, appear to have supported a model of “intensive mothering” that undermined women’s autonomy and power in pregnancy. In addition, the content and messaging of these classes appears to have contributed to a societal tendency to make pregnant women, especially poor women and women of color, invisible while privileging the fetus as a person rater than as a potential person."

abstract,"Abstract There is a growing need for better understanding of mechanisms underpinning the relationship between migration stress and HIV risk behaviors for the development of HIV prevention and control policy. Survey data from a random sample of 1293 Chinese rural-to-urban migrants were analyzed. Stress was assessed using the Domestic Migration Stress Questionnaire (DMSQ); mental health status was assessed using the Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI); and having sex with high-risk partners was assessed as if ever have had sex with high-risk partners (e.g., sex workers, intravenous injection drug users, blood donors, persons infected with HIV, persons with sexually transmitted infection, and same gender partners) in the past year. The proposed relationship was tested using mediation modeling method. Among the sample, 5.5 % reported having had sex with high-risk partners in the past year. Mediation analysis indicated that the relationship between DMSQ scores and having sex with high-risk partners was mediated by BSI (coefficient = 0.41, 95 % CI [0.21, 0.65]), including its components of somatization (0.32 [0.15, 0.53]), obsessive-compulsive disorder (0.31 [0.07, 0.55]), depression (0.45 [0.23, 0.72]), anxiety (0.41 [0.23, 0.63]), and hostility (0.35 [0.17, 0.56]). Furthermore, the effect was more pronounced in males than in females. The study findings provide new data advancing our understanding of the mechanism of engagement in risky sex, underscoring the need for the HIV prevention policies in China to pay more attention to mental health of the rural-to-urban migrant population."

abstract,"Abstract Commercial sex workers are at significant risk of contracting HIV. Scholars have identified economic insecurity and the exploitation resulting from it as structural vectors of HIV risk for this community. While community-led structural interventions have successfully reduced HIV risk with sex workers, economic structural interventions remain under-utilized and under-studied in this population. The few existing economic interventions described in the literature are limited to individual interventions and do not adopt a community-led structural intervention approach. We conduct a literature review to examine the connections between economic insecurity and sex worker HIV risk, the limitations of existing economic interventions with sex workers, and the evidence in support of HIV structural interventions with sex workers. We then develop a conceptual framework for a community-led structural economic intervention model that would enable sex workers to negotiate the socio-political and economic barriers that increase their HIV vulnerability. Specifically, we articulate an economic structural intervention model which stands on three pillars: (1) a meaningful community ownership, (2) a multilevel (individual, community, socio-political) intervention approach, and (3) a commitment to empowering sex workers as workers, rather than an orientation that seeks to rescue them from sex work through alternative income generation."

history,"['2017-12', '2016-11-02']"
abstract,"Abstract This paper illuminates the experiences of sexuality of disabled women in Zimbabwe, from a standpoint where the women challenge the myth that they are asexual beings. Sixteen women with disabilities participated in this study and a number of themes emerged from an analysis of their narratives. A discussion of all the themes that emerged in the broad study is beyond the scope of this article; hence, in this paper, we focus on four themes that illuminate the active sexuality of participants: (1) dynamic engagement in intimate partner relationships, (2) drawing feminine strategic power from cultural practices of sexual initiation, (3) enhancing eroticism through vaginal modification, and (4) reproduction and motherhood. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that while disabled women may acknowledge the oppression they perceive as being characteristic of their experiences of sexuality, they are not passive recipients of disability and sexuality stereotypes. Disabled women construct their own understanding of what it means to be sexual and they assert their sexuality in ways that challenge the dominant, restrictive, and ableist constructions of sexuality. The themes that we discuss in this article highlight the intersectional nature of the experiences of sexuality of participants within a critical feminist disability studies theoretical framework."

abstract,"Abstract This research highlights how frontline workers in the HIV/AIDS sector in Canada mobilize the confessional as a technology of governance to encourage changes in the sexual health and safety and disclosure practices of HIV-positive men and women. The ways in which frontline workers counsel clients are especially important in light of Canada’s aggressive growth in criminal prosecutions against individuals for failing to disclose their HIV status to sexual partners. Drawing on 62 semi-structured interviews with AIDS service organization (ASO) staff from across Canada, we suggest that the work performed by ASO workers constitutes a form of bioethics on the ground, which is rooted in both the worker’s and the client’s lived experiences of HIV. It can be especially fraught if the lived experience is mobilized in ways that are ultimately disempowering for clients who do not relate to the individual’s disclosure narrative."

abstract,"Abstract It is estimated that long-term care (LTC) facilities in the US will experience a 40 % increase in occupancy between the years 2000 to 2020 (American Health Care Association 2012). Whole-person wellness embodies multiple elements of well-being, among which sexuality and the choice to remain sexually expressive, a basic human right for older adults, should be included. However, this right is largely overlooked in the context of LTC, and oftentimes, normative sexual expression among LTC residents is mislabeled as problematic behavior. Systems and bioecological theories provide a conceptual multilevel framework for understanding interactions among relevant institutions and government entities and their influence on residents’ sexual expression. The current article addresses the issue of preserving residents’ choices to be sexually expressive and places current US laws regarding sexual expression in LTC in the context of international perspectives on sexual health rights and laws. Input from LTC Ombudsmen from the US was utilized to inform recommendations to enhance current policies and contribute feedback for effective training guidelines for LTC staff in addressing residents’ sexual expression. Both universal acknowledgement of sexuality as a human right and legal guidelines are necessary to broaden understanding of the meaning of sexuality in older adulthood and aid in ethical and person-centered response strategies which promote autonomy and preserve each individual resident’s rights to sexual expression while maintaining safety."

abstract,"Abstract Casual sexual relations, understood as those in which there are no expectations of affective commitment, are increasingly common among youth. The goal of this study was to analyze the casual sexual behavior of students from a Spanish university, paying special attention to its relation with sociodemographic and psychosexual variables. Participants were 659 students from a Spanish university aged between 18 and 26 years, without a partner or being in a partner relationship of less than 12 months, who completed a battery of online questionnaires. It was found that about half of the participants had engaged in casual sex in the past year, with no differences as a function of gender. Engaging in casual sex was related to being older, less religious, performing risky sexual behaviors, and other psychosocial variables such as attitudes towards condoms, sociosexuality, and measures of personal well-being. The discussion highlights the need to conduct more research on casual sexual relations, due to the possible influence of cultural aspects in youth’s sociosexuality."

abstract,"Abstract Representations of the sex industry as a nest for involuntary sex work and exploitation shape the answers governments formulate to regulate the industry. In the legalized sex industry of the Netherlands, additional regulations and measures have been implemented recently to expand control and to prevent human trafficking. Increasing criticisms however claim that stricter control of the sex industry is not always in favor of the people concerned. This article uses symbolic interactionism to explore the meanings sex workers ascribe to their situation, to their work, and to the government’s interventions. The article addresses an example of a recently introduced anti-trafficking measure: the mandatory intake of people who want to work in the sex industry, meaning a face-to-face conversation with the authorities. This intake should inform sex workers and provide the local authorities with the possibility of identifying signs of trafficking, which can lead to work restrictions. However, interviews with sex workers show that the government’s intentions to offer help and protection for sex workers can mean control, discrimination, and work restrictions. Whereas the government wants to preclude possible victims of human trafficking from working in the sex industry, sex workers perceive their situation as a possibility to improve their lives. As a consequence, they withhold information about pimps and boyfriends from the authorities, or move to work in other cities, and sparingly use the assistance offered by the authorities."

abstract,"Abstract Teachers and health care professionals are seen as valuable collaborators in delivering sensitive topics to learners. A qualitative exploration of how teachers and school staff described their teaching experiences when teaching sexuality education programmes was conducted at Special Needs Schools in South Africa. A total of 78 participants (68 teachers and 10 school staff) completed three open-ended response questions that were part of a survey questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and perceptions (KABP) of teaching practises related to teaching sexuality education. In spite of learners’ disabilities, specifically their cognitive level of functioning, participants noted the importance and the right of learners with disabilities to receive this information. Participants reported that some learners are well informed about the topic of sexuality and are already sexually active. Though they acknowledged various challenges in teaching this topic, participants also expressed the urgency for an updated and relevant curriculum to be implemented. It is imperative to provide sufficient support to learners with disabilities in the form of sexuality education, in order to help them understand their sexuality better. This will lead to meaningful participation and engagement, ensuring that learners with disabilities are treated with dignity and respect."

However, less attention is paid to the sexuality of people diagnosed with intellectual disabilities. This narrative review summarises what is currently known about the level of sexual health knowledge of people with intellectual disabilities. A literature review was conducted of the published literature using Google Scholar, PubMed, PsychInfo, EBSCOhost and Science Direct. Forty-eight articles were identified that addressed the question about the level of sexual health knowledge of people with intellectual disabilities. Overall, studies demonstrate that people with intellectual disabilities are highly variable in levels of sexual knowledge, but on average have a range of deficits in knowledge compared to non-disabled individuals. More tailored education and support in accessing formal and informal sources of information are needed."

abstract,"Abstract This study examined the relationship between traditional machismo and prejudice toward lesbian and gay individuals as mediated by contact in a Latino college sample. Gender was examined as a potential moderator. Undergraduate students from a public university in South Texas (128 males and 447 females; mean age = 22.1. SD = 4.75) completed online measures of prejudice toward lesbian and gay individuals, machismo, and contact experience with lesbian and gay individuals. Contact significantly mediated the relationship between machismo and anti-gay prejudice, yet this indirect effect was relatively small. Significant direct and indirect effects of machismo on prejudiced attitudes toward lesbian and gay individuals were found. Gender did not moderate the relationship between machismo and contact. Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce Latinos’ prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women should take cultural views toward gender roles into consideration. Increased positive contact experience with lesbian and gay individuals may be a possible avenue to decrease anti-gay prejudice that stems from heightened traditional machismo."

abstract,"Abstract Using Add Health, a US-based nationally representative survey, this study predicts the likelihood of identifying as straight among (1) individuals who reported same-sex attractions and/or sexual practices and (2) among those who reported neither, given that many respondents nonetheless identified as something other than straight. It also (3) predicts the likelihood of changing one’s sexual identity to heterosexuality across survey waves. Weighted logistic regression identifies political conservatism and religiosity as predictors of straight identification and changing to a straight sexual identity, even after controlling for attractions and sexual practices. The results suggest that individuals with same-sex attractions and/or sexual practices do not identify as straight simply because of limitations of well-known sexual identities (straight, bisexual, gay/lesbian), given that Add Health offered more nuanced options, such as mostly straight. Instead, the results suggest that non-sexual social factors, such as religiosity and conservative political attitudes—themselves shaped by patterned social forces—are keys to heterosexual identification and heterosexual identity change. This paper offers the first quantitative test of critical heterosexuality theory using a nationally representative sample, suggesting that the approach is theoretically generalizable beyond qualitative studies."

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of how we developed a theory- and evidence-based sexual prejudice reduction program suitable for the Dutch high school context, guided by the intervention mapping approach (IM). In line with IM, six steps were followed: an initial needs assessment in which empirical, theoretical, and new data were gathered to acquire a thorough understanding of the problem (step 1); the formulation of program objectives for both students and teachers (step 2); the selection of theory-based methods and applications (step 3); program development (step 4); the provision of an adoption and implementation plan (step 5); and the development of an evaluation plan (step 6). In conclusion, developing a sexual prejudice reduction program for schools is a challenging but feasible process. IM is an effective tool for the systematic (theory- and evidence-driven) development of such a program."

abstract,"Abstract The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) in Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage throughout all US states and territories. Before that decision, after, and 1 year later, this successive-independent samples study identified clusters of individuals across the US based on worldview ideologies and used those clusters to examine effects of the SCOTUS decision on support for gay rights and sexual prejudice. Participants were 407 adults from 49 US states and territories. A cluster analysis identified three worldview groups: conservatives (23.6%), moderates (30.2%), and progressives (46.2%). Although no overall changes emerged over time in support for gay rights or sexual prejudice, the conservative group showed a marked polarization after the SCOTUS decision, becoming less supportive of gay rights and more prejudiced. Worldviews explained 68.3% of the variance in same-sex marriage support, 67.5% in gay rights support, and 68.8% in sexual prejudice, effects approaching nearly three times a large-sized effect in the social sciences. These findings add nuance to our understanding of the attitudinal impact of court decisions or legislation around progressive issues like same-sex marriage and gay rights, as well as the potential barriers to cultural progress on these issues."

abstract,"Abstract This paper discusses the genealogy of prostitution policies in Brussels through the lens of morality politics. It uses the analytical framework proposed by Hendrik Wagenaar and Altink (2012) to compare the formulation and implementation of policies in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with today’s policymaking in Brussels as well as the discourses underlying those policies. Although it departs from the six characteristics of morality politics, the study introduces one element that adds to the complexity of policymaking in this domain: gender. We argue that a gendered ideology and stigma have informed past and present prostitution policies in Brussels and that the many actors involved in the city’s policymaking have more often than not relied on emotions and personal views on female sexuality to support their calls for the control or outright repression of public commercial sex. The comparative analysis illustrates the persistent symbolic nature of policy formulation and a blatant disregard for data, both of which have led to the approval of unworkable laws and sudden policy shifts. However, the participation of new actors in the debates about prostitution in recent years has ushered in an increase in questionings of morality politics and will hopefully bolster calls for fact-based policies."

abstract,"Abstract Sex-on-premise venues for gay/bisexual men have been identified as high-HIV risk environments, partly because they seem to have norms discouraging discussion of safer sex. This study investigated individual and collective norms about social and sexual interaction in these venues through qualitative interviews with 20 men recruited from private sex parties in New York City. All participants recognized that there was a collective norm encouraging casual conversation at sex parties, which was supported by organizational features of these events; however, participants’ willingness to engage in social interaction ranged widely. Although conversation seemed pervasive in the social area of parties, most participants said there was no conversation in the sexual area and very few participants reported ever asking potential sex partners about HIV status or safer-sex preferences. Participants preferred going to events that set clear expectations regarding condom use (either “safer-sex” or “bareback” parties). These data point to a dichotomy in the norms of sex parties where conversation is expected in the social area of a venue but inappropriate around sexual activity. Sexual health interventions targeted to this population are more likely to be successful if they take the social and sexual norms of these events into account."

We conducted a cross-sectional online national survey among 18–30-year-old participants in Macedonia. We facilitated two focus groups with a subset of sexual and gender minority participants to gain an additional context about their everyday lives and experiences of discrimination. We performed unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models between sexual and gender identity and discrimination scales, as well as rumination and social anxiety. We calculated indirect effects using the Judd and Kenny difference of coefficients approach and used framework analysis to analyze the focus groups. Overall, 396 persons completed the survey, 178 identified as cisgender male and 200 identified as cisgender female. Sexual and gender minorities had higher scores on the rumination scale, 48.6 vs. 45.6 (p = 0.039), as compared to non-sexual and gender minorities. Sexual and gender minority persons had scores on the social anxiety that were higher than those of non-sexual and gender minority persons, 17.7 vs. 12.9 (p = 0.000). Experiences of discrimination due to one’s sexual orientation and gender identity accounted for a substantial portion of the increased anxiety and rumination. Focus groups confirmed the quantitative findings. Sexual and gender minority persons in Macedonia have poorer mental health outcomes as compared to non-sexual and gender minority persons, with discrimination being a major factor. Policies are needed to safeguard their rights, and interventions are also needed to provide mental health support and services to the population in an identity-friendly and affirming manner."

abstract,"Abstract On December 11, 2013, the Indian Supreme Court recriminalized non-peno-vaginal sex under Sec. 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), overturning a 2009 ruling that deemed IPC Sec. 377 unconstitutional. Similar “sodomy laws” in other countries have been associated with increased violence, harassment, and other discrimination against men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. However, few studies have looked at the effects of such a law in an Indian context. This study examined experiences of victimization among MSM and hijra/transgender women (MSM-H) in the State of Maharashtra using a mixed-method approach. Data came from a quantitative survey and qualitative focus groups and interviews from an HIV prevention study as well as qualitative media and case reports from a local MSM-H-serving community-based organization. MSM-H in Maharashtra reported experiencing a high frequency of harassment, violence, and extortion, particularly from male sex partners met online and police. IPC Sec. 377 was implicated across qualitative sources as creating a culture of protection for harassment against MSM-H by being used directly as a tool for harassment, hindering victims of harassment from seeking legal recourse, and adversely impacting HIV and healthcare services. The reinstated IPC Sec. 377 may directly and indirectly facilitate negative health outcomes among MSM-H. Health agencies and advocates should continue to monitor the impact of IPC Sec. 377, incorporate rights-based approaches to protect MSM-H identities while addressing their health and well-being, and explore avenues to initiate discussions with the government to work toward repealing the law."

abstract,"Abstract This article focuses on how lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) adults in 159 “It Gets Better” videos used happiness discourse to provide advice for an assumed adolescent viewer experiencing anti-queer bullying. Employing a grounded theory approach to analyze the videos and building on sociological analyses of changing sexuality norms, the author develops the concept of “disregarding heteronormativity” to account for processes that draw attention away from the widespread privileging and normalizing of heterosexuality. Indeed, findings reveal that makers of the videos not only localized anti-LGBTQ violence and harassment to adolescent schools, emphasizing the decline or disappearance of discriminatory events into adulthood, but also emphasized happiness and positivity more than power relations and structural constraints. At times, this emphasis included suggestions that bullied LGBTQ youth could improve their lives by adopting a more positive outlook or ignoring the negative opinions of other people. Thus, makers of the videos generally positioned violence against queer youth as primarily solvable through emotional management, contributing to the individualizing and depoliticizing of this social problem. In contrast, the author argues for analyses that resist the disregarding of heteronormativity and instead position unequal power relations as enduring and widespread structural features of US society."

keyword,"['Sexual minority men\xa0', 'Sexual assault\xa0', 'Secondary victimization\xa0']"
history,"['2017-09', '2016-07-27']"
abstract,"Abstract The estimated prevalence of adult sexual assault among sexual minority men (SMM) is comparable to published estimates for women. Adult sexual assault is associated with low disclosure rates and poor physical and mental health in SMM. One potential negative consequence of disclosures is secondary victimization, whereby victims perceive disclosure recipients’ reactions as victim-blaming or discriminatory and, therefore, retraumatizing. The published literature on secondary victimization among SMM is limited to the reporting of hate crimes and has not been extended to adult sexual assault, despite its high prevalence among SMM. Here, we explored the adult sexual assault disclosure experiences of 18 SMM through qualitative interviews (M age = 42.4 years). We observed four themes: (1) secondary victimization behaviors by disclosure recipients; (2) the role of sexual orientation in disclosure experiences; (3) participants’ own emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to secondary victimization; and (4) participants’ perceptions about how disclosure influenced their long-term recovery process from adult sexual assault. Secondary victimization behaviors included dismissal, blaming, and attributing sexual assault to alcohol use or sexual orientation. Disclosure recipients’ responses strongly influenced men’s future disclosures. Future mixed-methods research investigating the impact of secondary victimization on mental and physical health of SMM is warranted."

Factors shaping parental decisions were categorized as sociodemographic (gender, age and cohort, and race/ethnicity), personal (internalization of anti-homosexual prejudice and openness about one’s non-heterosexual orientation), relational (one’s partner’s parental motivation and social support), and contextual (work conditions, access to LGBT support networks, information and resources, and social, legal, and medical barriers). Research findings were discussed and implications for future research and social policies regarding the issue of prospective lesbian and gay parenthood were drawn."

abstract,"Abstract Substance use occurs at higher rates in men who have sex with men (MSM) than the general population, and, as a whole, is quantitatively linked to sexual risk behaviour. However, quantitative studies cannot adequately account for meanings, agency and role of social venue in shaping substance use, especially as regards sexual outcomes. To develop new theoretical constructs linking social venues and substance use in MSM, we systematically reviewed relevant qualitative studies and re-analysed them using a dimensional analysis method of grounded theory. Our analysis yielded an organising dimension of ‘littoral spaces’ in order to understand the meaning of MSM’s substance use in relation to the social venue. This space is characterised as different from everyday life, through the altering of social boundaries; defined by its illegal qualities; and described as ‘tribal’ and ‘ritual’. Substance use behaviours are embedded as performative regimes within these littoral spaces. Interventions for this population do not adequately account for the role of space in substance use behaviours. Harm reduction interventions, and interventions taking an approach focused on ‘durable’ planning for an entire evening, might offer improved effects."

history,"['2017-09', '2016-09-01']"
abstract,"Abstract Support for lesbians’, gay men’s, bisexuals’, and transgender people’s (LGBT) rights has increased over the last two decades. However, these recent trends hide existing disparities between and within countries. In particular, workplace discrimination is still a relatively widespread phenomenon. Although many countries lack legal provision protecting LGBT employees, numerous organizations have adopted LGBT-supportive policies over the last two decades. Many studies have investigated the business case for diversity arguments and tested whether diversity brings about positive business outcomes. However, few studies have studied their effect on outcomes that do not directly affect employees’ productivity. This article aims at filling this gap and examines whether LGBT-supportive policies help (1) to reduce discrimination based on sexual discrimination and (2) to increase LGB employees’ well-being and psychological health at work. Results  show that diversity management contributes to shaping the experience of LGB employees by reducing discrimination and increasing overall well-being at work. However, LGBT-supportive policies do not influence employees’ psychological health outcomes."

abstract,"Abstract While it is clear that there are existing prejudices directed toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people across the globe, very few studies have provided in-depth investigations of such attitudes from an international comparative perspective, and no cross-cultural studies to date have investigated attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals. Without understanding how correlates of attitudes toward LGBT individuals are both similar and different across multiple international locations, it is unclear how we can learn to counteract negative prejudices toward these groups. In the current study, we explore how measures of politics, feminism, and religion affect attitudes toward LGBT individuals using Worthen’s (2012) Attitudes Toward LGBT People Scales and data from four college student samples in Oklahoma, Texas, Italy, and Spain (N = 1311). Results  suggest three trends: (1) negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals are more pervasive in Oklahoma than in any of the other university samples and are most positive among Spanish students; (2) negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals are related to the individual and multiplicative effects of political beliefs, feminism, and religiosity across all four samples; and (3) constructs related to attitudes toward gays/lesbians differ from those that relate to attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals. Such findings indicate that there are important similarities and differences in prejudices toward LGBT individuals and that attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals should be included in future international comparative research."

history,"['2017-09', '2017-03-30']"
abstract,"Abstract Young adult sexual minority women (YSMW) are at elevated risk for negative reproductive health outcomes, yet are less likely than heterosexual peers to utilize preventive health care. Medical and public health policy organizations advocate sexual orientation disclosure (“coming out”) to health care providers as a strategy for increasing service utilization among YSMW. Limited research explores relationships between disclosure and receipt of sexual health services. YSMW (N = 285) ages 21–24 participated in an online survey assessing their health behaviors and care utilization. We employed multivariable logistic regression models to examine the association between receipt of sexual health services and sexual orientation disclosure to provider, after adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-five percent of YSMW were out to their provider. Less than half the sample had received Pap screening or STI testing in the previous year; approximately 15% had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccination. Disclosure was associated with increased likelihood of Pap screening (OR=2.66, p < .001) and HPV vaccination (OR=4.30, p < .001), but was not significantly associated with STI testing. Promoting coming out to providers may be a promising approach to increase sexual health care use among YSMW. Future research should explore causal relationships between these factors."

abstract,"Abstract Using findings from a qualitative investigation based on in-depth asynchronous online interviews with 425 self-identified LGB Portuguese individuals (73.9 % gay, 12.3 % lesbian, and 13.8 % bisexual), this paper explores the role of political and legislative changes in the everyday lives of LGB individuals after the implementation of recent political and legislative changes in the country, such as the 2010 law allowing same-sex couples to marry and the 2016 law allowing same-sex couples to adopt and joint-adopt children. Participants were asked to complete a structured interview online, which consisted of socio-demographic questions concerning age, sexual orientation, gender, occupation, education, relationship status, and knowledge of the legislation that affected them as an LGB person. Participants were also asked to write a response to a single open-ended and fundamental question: “As an LGB person, what was the most important thing that happened to you over the last year because of the political and legislative changes concerning LGB rights implemented in Portugal?” The content analysis of the major findings was structured around the following main thematic areas: relationships and family, coming out issues, health issues, happiness and personal development, and social and political changes. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of political and legislative changes in the everyday lives of LGB people, as delivering this type of knowledge is a very important tool to fight discrimination against LGB individuals."

One hundred thirty-eight gay and lesbian participants read four gender-typed scenarios: in two, a gay student and a lesbian student were portrayed as more stereotypically masculine, and in the other two, two gay and lesbian students were described as more stereotypically feminine. Participants rated the targets on a scale assessing negative emotions. The results showed that the feminine gay male target provoked more negative emotions than the other three targets, among both gay and lesbian participants. Moreover, gay and lesbian participants felt more negative emotions towards the masculine lesbian target than the feminine lesbian one. In the end, while the feminine gay man target elicited more negative emotions than the feminine lesbian target, the masculine gay man target did not elicit more negative emotions than the masculine lesbian one. Implications of the results are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract The legal status of sex workers is correlated with their occupational health and safety. However, there is little consensus on the ideal legal framework for prostitution. Obtaining a good understanding of the opinions of different stakeholders will provide policymakers, health care professionals, and social workers with the necessary information to make decisions on how to protect the health and safety of sex workers and to propose laws on prostitution. This is a review of the literature on the attitudes of different stakeholders towards sex workers. A search of the literature identified a total of 49 studies that could ultimately be included in this review. The studies explored the attitudes towards prostitution among law enforcement officers, professionals in health and social services, clients of sex workers, the general public, and other multiple stakeholders. There was a lack of consensus among these stakeholders on accepting sex workers, and not everyone supported the decriminalization or legalization of prostitution in their countries. Although the debate over the legal status of prostitution seems unlikely to end in the foreseeable future, the findings of this review provide some indications that interventions among different professional groups are needed to improve the health and safety of sex workers."

abstract,"Abstract Australian HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services are well-established for men who have sex with men (MSM) who identify as gay or bisexual. However, the sexual health needs of heterosexually identified MSM (hereafter called “straight MSM” as a shorthand) and opportunities to engage this sub-group with services and information are less clear. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2015–2016 with 30 professionals working in the sexual health sector in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Participants viewed straight MSM as comprising multiple, intersecting sub-groups, but sharing a common preference for services which promise “discretion” and “confidentiality”, and information which does not presume an alignment between gay identity and sex between men. Participants described these men as typically very concerned about keeping this aspect of their sexual lives secret and separate from their family, work, and community lives. Participants were keenly aware of both the benefits and the challenges of providing respectful and non-judgmental care. This exploratory study provides initial evidence of the complexities of engaging straight MSM with sexual health care and suggests a range of strategies for increasing cultural understanding of the diverse sexual practices that can be present in the lives of some heterosexually identified men."

history,"['2017-06', '2017-02-18']"
abstract,"Abstract Gay and lesbian bars are considered a safe haven. Safe havens exist because of the larger cultural environment that makes safe places necessary. Some communities have noted reductions in the need for gay and lesbian bars due to growing acceptance within the community. However, many states and communities within the South and Bible Belt continue to propose and pass bills which target or restrict the freedoms of LGBT persons. These cultural overtones may support or encourage targeted violence, including the Pulse Nightclub Massacre which was the deadliest incidence of violence targeted at LGBT persons in the USA. This manuscript presents two studies: one at gay bars in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a socially conservative city/state, and the other examines four US communities following the Pulse Nightclub Massacre. Study 1 included interviews at entrance to the bar, exit from the bar, and within a week of leaving the bar in order to identify feelings of safety and comfort. Study 2 seeks to compare gay bar attendance and feelings of comfort and safety in gay bars in regions of the USA with varying structural stigma. Results  of study 1 suggest that the participants felt safe (82.4%, n = 42) and comfortable (72.5%, n = 37). In study 2, individuals from Tulsa, Oklahoma were compared to individuals in New York and the DC metro area and were significantly less likely to attend gay bars after the Pulse shooting (t = 2.53 and 3.66, p ≤ 0.01 and p ≤ 0.001, respectively). Moreover, compared to individuals living in the DC metro area and Philadelphia, participants residing in the city in a conservative state felt significantly less safe attending gay bars (t = −2.03 and −2.30, respectively; p ≤ 0.05). No differences across the communities were noted by comfort within the gay bar space. In light of a changing political landscape, additional programming efforts may be necessary at gay bars in communities with high structural stigma. These efforts may include supporting the naturally occurring feelings of community connectedness and facilitating community building."

history,"['2017-06', '2016-07-12']"
abstract,"Abstract The aim of the study is to provide evidence about the validity and reliability of the Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale. The scale identifies two types of rejection of same-sex parenting: individual opposition and normative opposition. Individual opposition identifies opinions involving open and more aggressive rejection toward the effects of the child-rearing and educational practices of same-sex parents. The attribution of the children’s possible psychological difficulties and maladjustments is directly linked to the sexual orientation of the same-sex parents. Normative opposition identifies beliefs and opinions linked to everyday heterosexism that are present in our society and represent a subtle form of heterosexism. The scale was administrated to 326 Spanish heterosexual university students. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure. The findings showed that personal contact inversely correlates with the rejection of same-sex parents, the etiology of the homosexual orientation correlates with rejection of same-sex parents when the belief is that homosexuality is learned, and supporting the civil rights of gay people also correlates with rejection of same-sex parents. These findings can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity."

Students (N = 507) at a large public university in the intermountain west region of the USA completed a survey in February and March 2015. Multivariable multiple regression was conducted to test the association between perceptions of students regarding university polices on sexual assault and individual factors. The factors that were predictive for student perceptions of sexual assault policy importance included student gender, affiliation with a campus organization, previous report of sexual assault to university officials, and adherence to particular anti-rape attitudes. Attitudes and perceptions of sexual assault may be very important for successful implementation of university policies related to sexual assault."

abstract,"Abstract Many same-sex couples had already established long-term relationships prior to the availability of civil marriage rights in the USA. The impact and possible benefits of marriage and marriage recognition for long-term couples was tested using data from a sample of couple members: 307 in a civil marriage and 50 with no legal relationship status. The reported study was conducted prior to marriage recognition in all US states and tests the associations of marital status and living in a state that recognized civil marriages of same-sex couples with self-reports of positive and negative LGB (lesbian, gay, and bisexual) identity, social support, and daily discrimination. Dyadic regression analyses revealed that participants in a civil marriage reported higher levels of LGB identity centrality and support from partner. Residing in a state that recognized civil marriage was associated with lower levels of LGB identity concealment, a less difficult process accepting one’s LGB identity, and less vigilance and isolation. Results  are discussed in terms of the benefits of long-term relationships and the impact of socio-historical context and marriage policy on same-sex relationships."

abstract,"Abstract Currently, the Willingness to Engage in Consensual Non-monogamy (CNM) Scale (Journal of Social and Personal Relationships 32: 222-240, 2015) is the only known measure for assessing CNM desire among individuals who have never engaged in CNM. However, the factor structure and validity of this measure have yet to be tested. Further, scholars have yet to consider that this scale may measure different constructs across men and women. Given the magnitude and consistency with which previous work has reported gender differences in CNM research, it is worthy to critically evaluate this scale. The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure and validity of the Willingness to Engage in CNM Scale. Additionally, this study examined the factorial invariance of this scale across men and women. Results  from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses using a large sample (N = 938) of college attending emerging adults (ages 18–29) supported a single-factor structure for all items in the scale. This study also found supporting evidence for convergent and divergent validity. A multigroup confirmatory factor analysis indicated partial measurement invariance across men and women. Implications for CNM research, methodology, and policy are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Sexting is defined as the exchange of provocative or sexually explicit content via smartphone, Internet, or social networks. Previous studies found a relationship between cyber pornography and sexting. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between sexting, cyber pornography, and alcohol consumption. Previous evidence underlined the disinhibitory effect of alcohol on sexual responsiveness. Therefore, the possible moderating role of alcohol consumption was investigated in the relationship between cyber pornography addiction and sexting. The Sexting Behaviors Questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and the Cyber Pornography Use Inventory were administered to 610 adolescents (63 % females; mean age = 16.8). Boys reported significantly more sexting, alcohol consumption, and cyber pornography addiction than girls. As expected, sexting was robustly correlated with alcohol consumption and cyber pornography. In line with these expectations, we found that the relationship between cyber pornography and sexting was moderated by different level of alcohol consumption. In those who reported low levels of alcohol consumption, the relationship between cyber pornography and sexting was not significant. On the contrary, in those who reported high alcohol consumption, this relationship was stronger and significant. Thus, the results suggest that alcohol restraint could represent a protective factor against engaging in sexting, even in the presence of high cyber pornography addiction."

abstract,"Abstract Dutch national LGBT policies are not bi-inclusive and this study provides suggestions for improvement, based on empirical research. Attention for bisexuality in policy appears simply to pay lip service and to endorse the construction of sexual orientation as a hetero/homo binary. The outcomes of our survey (n = 1449) and in-depth interviews (n = 38) of Dutch same-sex attracted young people suggest that special attention for bisexual people is warranted. Compared to exclusively same-sex attracted participants, the equally both-sex attracted participants scored worse on openness about their sexual attraction, visibility discomfort, perceived acceptance, and suicide attempts. Unique issues for bisexual-identified young people were identified as follows: marginalization of bisexuality; difficulty expressing bisexuality, particularly in relationships; and a lack of bisexual or bi-inclusive communities. These issues were all related to the hetero/homo binary and mononormativity. Suggested implications for more bi-inclusive policies focus on awareness of marginalization and invisibility of bisexuality, biphobia, community and capacity building, and comprehensive sexuality and gender education. Furthermore, rather than policies focusing on sameness, a comprehensive diversity perspective on sexuality and gender offers more space for bisexuality. This may be particularly relevant for young people who are exploring their sexuality and developing a sense of their sexual self."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, I argue that the implementation of the “Swedish model”—the criminalization of the purchase of sex—in Northern Ireland in 2014 provides an example of a morality-driven policy process in which the actual concerns of sex workers were distorted and dismissed. In the policy debate, sex workers were portrayed as victims who had no choice—a claim passionately refuted by many sex workers. As a result of the narrow focus on “victim vs. free choice,” there has been little room to discuss the actual working conditions of sex workers and the structural constraints that inhibit their freedom and negatively affect their well-being. In this paper, I present the contradictions and conflicts between the personal opinions of Northern Irish policy-makers on one hand and the actual experiences and views of sex workers on the other. By juxtaposing these views, I facilitate a belated conversation between policy-makers and sex workers—a conversation which can inform policy debates in other jurisdictions."

abstract,"Abstract Previous literature indicates that the American public is comfortable including multiple topics in sexual health education curriculum in public schools, yet comprehensive sex education is often portrayed as controversial, especially in the southern USA. Southern university students (N = 560) completed an online survey containing 18 potential sexual health education topics that could be taught in schools. Favorability and timing of all topics as well as demographics variables’ relationships with a total topic endorsement score were assessed. All topics were endorsed by a majority of participants. The least endorsed topic (sexual pleasure) was still selected to be taught at some time by a majority (70 %) of participants. Political affiliation had the strongest relationship with overall endorsement of topics followed by religious commitment. Political affiliation mediated the predictive path of religious commitment to the total topic endorsement score. Findings indicated that, similar to previous literature, individuals would like a wide variety of topics to be included in sexual health education. Therefore, ideas of heightened dispute surrounding comprehensive sex education in the southern USA may be unfounded. Additionally, caution should be exercised when assessing religious individual’s support or opposition of sexual health topics without also analyzing their political affiliation."

To understand why this sexuality difference occurs, we performed a logistic regression analysis to decipher the importance of four explanations: essentialism, selection, embeddedness, and conversion. We discovered that participation in political groups is the best explanation of the sexuality gap in activism, but racial attitudes were also important. Type of college major was generally connected to student activism, but educational attainment and disciplinary curriculums did not explain the increased activism of sexual minorities."

abstract,"Abstract Compared to monogamous relationships, consensual non-monogamous (CNM) relationships are stigmatized. Similarly, compared to heterosexual individuals, gay men are perceived to have more promiscuous and less committed romantic relationships. Hence, CNM and same-sex male relationships are potential targets of dehumanization (i.e., denied traits considered unique of human beings). We tested the impact of monogamy and sexual orientation on dehumanization, and examined if CNM (vs. monogamous) and same-sex (vs. heterosexual) partners are dehumanized through the attribution of primary (non-uniquely human) and secondary (uniquely human) emotions. A sample of heterosexual young adults (N = 585, 455 women; M age = 25.55, SD = 7.48) in three European countries—Croatia, Italy, and Portugal—attributed primary and secondary emotions to four groups: (a) CNM same-sex male partners, (b) CNM heterosexual partners, (c) monogamous same-sex male partners, and (d) monogamous heterosexual partners. Results  showed that uniquely human emotions were attributed less to CNM than to monogamous partners, and this happened regardless of sexual orientation. Furthermore, CNM same-sex and CNM heterosexual partners were evaluated similarly. This pattern of results was consistent across countries. The implication of these findings for social policies and sexual rights is discussed."

The SciELO, PePSIC, LILACS, Index Psi, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were searched for articles published up to and including the year 2015. After the applications of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final sample consisted of 39 articles. Three main dimensions of resilience appear to be studied in the literature: individual, family, and community-based. The majority of studies retrieved were international, empirical, cross-sectional, and quantitative, with a focus on individual resilience. Few studies discuss the simultaneous interaction between the individual, family, and social contexts, and their contributions to the process of resilience. The conceptual dimensions of resilience must be further integrated to provide a more accurate description of its relational and systemic nature."

abstract,"Abstract Why have proposals to “tackle demand” for sex workers by criminalizing their clients gained political traction in the UK? This article treats sex work policy debates as a site of contested norms concerning gender, sexuality, individual agency and the market. I argue that recent shifts away from a male breadwinner/female homemaker model of family life have disrupted established policy visions of desirable family and employment patterns. Calls to “tackle demand” for sex workers provide terrain to construct norms of gendered, sexual and market conduct which align with new policy visions of the dual earner family, nurturing fathers and employed mothers. Analysing recent policy documents, this article shows that governmental arguments in favour of “tackling demand” claim the policy will promote both women’s employment and gender equality in personal relationships. Furthermore, end demand discourse individualizes responsibility for continued gender inequality to the deviant sexual desires of a few bad men. The article concludes that end demand discourse deflects tensions inherent in policies which promote gender equality while reducing support for at-home mothers and thus exacerbating feminized poverty."

The current study aimed to experimentally investigate the effects of sex work stigma on observers’ victim blame and empathy toward sexual assault survivors. The participants included 197 undergraduate students from the Midwestern US who were randomly assigned to read a newspaper article reporting a sexual assault in which the victim’s identity was manipulated as a sex worker or a non-sex worker between the conditions. Results  indicated participants assigned to the article describing the rape of a sex worker responded to the article with statistically less victim empathy and more victim blame than participants who read an article describing the rape of a non-sex worker. Integrating stigma theory and qualitative research on sex work stigma, the implications of the results demonstrate a significant barrier sex workers may face within the criminal justice system when reporting acts of violence against them. Recommendations for sex work decriminalization, changing the conversation of academic discourse on sex work, and educational initiatives are proposed to reduce the stigma of this marginalized population."

abstract,"Abstract Same-sex marriage (SSM) has been a contentious topic in recent times. Despite current trends indicating that support for same-sex marriage is on the rise in Australia, attempts to introduce marriage equality legislation have failed. This study examined influential factors affecting attitudes towards same-sex marriage in Australia. A sample of heterosexual Australians completed a survey regarding their attitudes to marriage equality, homophobia, beliefs about a nature or nurture basis for same-sex attraction, common assumptions and beliefs about the etiology of same-sex attraction and social desirability. Believing that the etiology of same-sex attraction is nature-based predicted positive attitudes towards same-sex marriage whereas thinking sexual orientation is nurture-based predicted negative attitudes. Mediation analysis was used to assess the relationship between etiology beliefs and attitudes towards same-sex marriage. Homophobia fully explained the effect of nature beliefs and partially explained the effect of nurture beliefs on attitudes to same-sex marriage. Given that attitudes towards same-sex marriage are not created in a vacuum, the study also explored what people felt were their most influential sources of beliefs about the origins of same-sex attraction. The implications of the research findings for those lobbying for marriage equality in Australia are discussed."

history,['2017-03-16']
abstract,"Abstract This study describes a modification of a sex-related expectancy measure to measure sex-related marijuana expectancies, and results were significant. Original research on expectancies for marijuana was conducted over 25 years ago. During this time period, attitudes, values, and beliefs regarding marijuana use are rapidly changing. This study examined if sex-related drug expectancies (SRDEs) predicted the frequency of marijuana use. By changing the prompt of a sex-related alcohol expectancy measure that instructed participants to focus on drug use, the study sought to measure SRDEs in a general adult population. An online survey was advertised on social media sites like Facebook and Craigslist. The SRDEs were assessed on N = 419 individuals (326 women, 93 men) who indicated using marijuana over the past 12-month period. A one-way ANOVA for women (p < .001) determined there were significant differences between SRDE scores for individuals, and post hoc analysis determined significant differences between infrequent and frequent marijuana users. Similar results were found for men using independent t tests. According to the SRDE, both male and female frequent marijuana users have higher sex-related expectancies when compared to infrequent marijuana users. With cultural changes influencing use of marijuana, measures like the SRDE that assess sex-related drug expectancies will help researchers understand how sex-related drug expectancies influence drug use."

abstract,"Abstract In 2016, the European Medicines Agency approved the marketing of Truvada for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in European Union (EU) member states. As individual countries throughout the EU make decisions about whether to adopt PrEP and fund it via governmental insurance, it is vital to understand key populations’ knowledge of and attitudes toward PrEP. In 2015, 20 gay men completed face-to-face audio-recorded interviews, describing their knowledge of and attitudes toward PrEP (mean age 35.9; 35% HIV-positive, 65% HIV-negative). We found that in spite of PrEP not yet having been approved for marketing in Germany, all but one of the participants were aware of PrEP and knew the difference between PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP; which is approved for use in Germany). By and large, attitudes were favorable about PrEP, especially among HIV-negative participants. Next, there appeared to be an already high demand for PrEP with several participants going to great lengths to gain access to PrEP; two described intentions to obtain PEP for use as PrEP, one was obtaining PrEP via another country (where it was legal), and a fourth participant was discretely distributing PrEP out of his home. Our findings appear to validate anecdotal evidence suggesting high demand for PrEP and that some are already finding ways to obtain it without governmental approval. Our findings suggest that participants were prepared to see the rollout of PrEP in Berlin, pending its approval."

abstract,"Abstract It has been claimed that the decriminalization of sex work may result in its proliferation, but there is no evidence to prove or disprove this claim. We investigated whether decriminalization was associated with the prevalence of paying for sex. A representative national sample of 8074 Australian men interviewed by telephone reported whether they had paid for sex ever and in the last 12 months. Cross-sectional associations between paying for sex in the last 12 months and their jurisdiction’s legal approach to sex work (criminalized, licensed, or decriminalized), were examined with logistic regression analysis, controlling for demographic variables and relationship status. Overall, 2.2 % of the men reported paying for sex in the past year—a proportion that was not statistically different by state or territory (P = 0.26). The only variable that was associated with paying for sex was not having a regular sexual partner, or to a lesser extent, not living with a regular partner. Being aged 16–19 years was associated with lower odds of paying for sex. Being a male without a regular partner was associated with paying for sex. The legal approach to sex work in the respondent’s state of residence was not associated with having paid for sex."

abstract,"Abstract Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) experience minority stressors that impact their mental health, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors. Internalized homophobia (IH) and perceived stigma represent two of these minority stressors, and there has been limited research empirically validating measures of these constructs. We validated measures of IH and perceived stigma with a sample of 450 YMSM (mean age = 18.9) and a sample of 370 YMSM (mean age = 22.9). Results  from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported modifications to the IH and perceived stigma scales, ultimately revealing a three factor and one factor structure, respectively. Convergent and discriminant validity were examined utilizing correlations between IH, perceived stigma, and other variables related to minority stress (e.g., victimization). We evaluated predictive validity by examining relations with mental health, substance use, and risky sexual behaviors measured 12-months from baseline. There were mixed findings for IH, with subscales varying in their relations to mental health, drinking, and sexual risk variables. Perceived stigma was not related to mental health or substance use, but was associated with greater prevalence of STIs. Findings supported the use of these modified scales with YMSM and highlight the need for further measurement studies."

abstract,"Abstract This is the first study focusing on the use of non-prescribed aphrodisiacs by older male clients of FSWs in southwestern rural areas of Guangxi China. A cross-sectional survey was performed in low-cost commercial sex venues in 13 regions in Guangxi. Structured interviews collected data about demographics, general health status, commercial sex and aphrodisiac use behaviors, the awareness of HIV and the diagnostic services. Blood assays were conducted to test for HIV and syphilis infections. A sample of 3485 male clients from 50 to 92 years old were recruited, among which 1040 (29.8 %) were aphrodisiac users. HIV prevalence was 3.0 % (4.3 % among aphrodisiac users and 2.4 % among non-aphrodisiac users). Factors independently associated with aphrodisiac use included older age, ethnic minorities, low level of education, infected by HIV, having chronic disease, and not using condoms every time in commercial sex with FSWs. Aphrodisiacs were reported to improve sexual function by older male clients, and thereby unsafe commercial sex among them was facilitated. Aphrodisiac use can be viewed as a marker of a high-risk behavioral pattern for HIV transmission and infection in such a population."

In order to better understand the experiences of this multiply marginalized population, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 LGBTQ-POC to examine how they describe their experiences with identities, communities, discrimination, and health. Data consisted of verbatim interviews, which were guided by intersectionality theory and minority stress theory and analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Using intersectionality theory, this study addresses the simultaneity of oppressions and the ways in which having different combinations of marginalized identities may impact LGBTQ-POC well-being. Common issues discussed by respondents include disconnect from communities, relationships between identities, coming out, and stress and anxiety. The primary concepts introduced in this study include positive intersectionality and come out stress. "

abstract,"Abstract Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are gaining ground in civil rights but still experience exclusion or discrimination through social policy, and policy advocacy on behalf of LGBT people is an ongoing need. Social work practice areas intersect with policies that are relevant to LGBT people’s civil rights. This study examined the effects of social work graduate students’ gender, political views, religious attendance, beliefs about sexual orientation and gender identity choice, active critical thinking, and empathy, in combination with a cultural competence course, on attitudes about LGBT military policy, marital equality, and LGBT discrimination. Men and more conservative students had less affirming attitudes about LGBT military policy. Men and students with more conservative political ideology, less empathy, and more active thinking held less affirming attitudes about marital policy. Students who believed that sexual orientation and gender identity are not a choice were more likely to report recognition of LGBT discrimination. Students changed significantly after the course in their acknowledgement of discrimination, and attitudes stayed the same (generally affirming) about military policy and marital laws. Implications for examining critical thinking and empathy and attitudes about military policy and measuring course interventions for social workers with regard to attitudes about LGBT discrimination and related policies are discussed, and recommendations are made for future research."

history,"['2017-03', '2016-04-02']"
abstract,"Abstract Scholars of adolescent and emerging adult sexuality have recently begun to study how diverse patterns of sexual behaviors contribute to development and well-being. A person-oriented approach to studying sexual behaviors provides a nuanced understanding of sexual repertoires. The goals of this paper were to document patterns of sexual behaviors ranging from kissing to penetrative sex, and to examine how latent classes of behaviors, gender, and partner type (romantic versus nonromantic) predict intra- and interpersonal consequences of sexual behaviors. Latent class analysis of a stratified random sample of US college students revealed four classes of sexual behaviors: Kissing Only, Kissing and Touching, All Behaviors, and Oral and Penetrative Only. Compared to individuals in the All Behaviors class, individuals in the Kissing Only class were less likely to experience a positive or a negative intrapersonal consequence of sexual behaviors. Men were less likely to report a negative intrapersonal consequence than women were. Partner type predicted negative interpersonal consequences for the All Behaviors class. Implications are discussed in terms of normative sexual development, prevention, and sexual and relationship education."

Our results show that male, Catholic, right-wing respondents with fewer lesbian and gay (LG) friends prove the group exhibiting the highest levels of polymorphous prejudice. Furthermore, the introduction of psychological-level variables into the regression models increased the explained variance in polymorphous prejudice, above and beyond the remaining predictors. Additionally, we report different patterns of results when deploying regression analyses at the level of the sub-scales of polymorphous prejudice. We discuss our results within the light of contemporary sexual prejudice frameworks before reviewing the utility of results to interventions targeting discriminated LG individuals."

history,"['2017-03', '2016-05-10']"
abstract,"Abstract Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the USA experience a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections. Previous studies demonstrate that gay self-identification and outness are associated with GBM’s sexual risk-taking behaviors. However, little is known about the extent to which GBM make sexual decisions based on the level of HIV risk they associate with a male partner’s sexual identity. Using qualitative interviews with 13 GBM, we examine how a partner’s gay identification, outness, and sex with women influence perceptions of HIV risk and decisions about condoms. Participants discussed a reduced HIV risk perception for partners who were not gay-identified, not out, or having sex with women, based on the belief that they were not having sex with other men. Some participants stated that this could lead to condomless sex. Participants perceived lower risk despite stating that these partners had reduced exposure to HIV prevention interventions and increased substance use during intercourse. These findings indicate a potential discrepancy between how GBM perceive HIV risk and the behavioral factors associated with risk. HIV prevention messages and policies should focus on tackling the myth that a non-gay identity is protective of HIV and decentralize messages and policies from being only about gay men."

abstract,"Abstract Studies show equal impact of sexual harassment (SH) on men and women, whereas lay perceptions are that women suffer more. We identify the phenomenon of minimization of male suffering (MMS), which occurs when people assume that SH has less effect on men’s well-being and which results in the perpetrators of SH on men being evaluated less harshly. To verify whether these effects occur, we conducted two studies in which we presented stories describing acts of sexual coercion (SC, study 1) and SC or financial coercion (FC, study 2) and measured the perceived suffering of victims and the perception of the perpetrators. Both studies showed that female victims were perceived to suffer more from SC and FC and that perpetrators of both acts on women were evaluated more negatively. The results support our hypothesis that the suffering of male victims is minimized as they are perceived to suffer less than women."

abstract,"Abstract Since the declassification of homosexuality as a mental illness in 1973, psychology has transformed the way it approaches sexual orientation and gender identity issues in scientific research and clinical practice. The paradigmatic shift from psychopathology to identity has corresponded with the introduction of “LGBT affirmative therapy,” which suggests that therapists should affirm clients’ sexual orientations rather than reinforce sexual minorities’ experiences of stigma and marginalization. This qualitative study used a subset of psychotherapy training videos about LGBT issues to explore the form of content of LGBT affirmative therapy in the context of increased attention to identity and multiculturalism in applied psychology. The videos suggest that multiculturally competent therapists should understand sexuality and gender issues in terms of what psychologists call “multiple” or “intersecting” identities, namely race and ethnicity. While the multicultural turn in psychotherapy may signal a transformation in mental health service provision, our analysis questions whether these videos may unintentionally reflect a neoliberal logic of inclusion that obscures the structural dimensions of social inequality. We suggest that the uptake of intersectionality-like identitarian discourse in psychotherapy in particular offers opportunities for challenging and reinforcing neoliberalism."

abstract,"Abstract In August of 1999, not too long before narratives of sex trafficking began to dominate prostitution policy debates, the residents of a small town in Nevada debated closing the city’s legal brothels. Citizens crowded the hearing hall, holding signs about protecting family and community values. But instead of opposing prostitution, as one might have expected, most public commenters echoed a sign that read, “Pro Family, Pro Prostitution.” Drawing on an analysis of the testimony of the 51 citizens in attendance at that public hearing and ethnographic data gathered in four visits to Evenheart over a 1-year period, this paper examines the arguments that framed support for, and opposition to, legal prostitution at this critical historic juncture. The research finds important differences in the ways particular neoliberal discourses can be deployed to the wide range of sexual, gender, and relationship values that constitute heterosexuality. Both supporters and opponents drew on market logics—defined for purposes of this paper as a neoliberal individualism and economic rationality of free trade, scarcity, competition, and self-regulation—as well as on discourses of morality and the family, but each side used them in strikingly different ways. Brothel supporters drew on market logics to defend and support individualized family values and a market-driven morality, while brothel opponents deployed market logics that supported conservative heteronormative values and morals. I suggest that these deployments of market logics, particularly among brothel supporters, are instances of “heteroflexibility” in neoliberal governance, that is, flexibility in the various gender, sexual, and relationship norms that collectively make up heterosexuality as an institution. Key to the intensity of heteroflexibility’s challenge to heterosexuality, both then and today, is whether market logics use free choice or protection discourses in the neoliberal governance of sexuality."

In so doing, the essay analyzes how states continue to thrive by extending market principles through privatization, promoting the interests of the urban middle classes while dislocating subaltern communities, and upholding racist and nationalist ideologies by deporting select migrant populations."

abstract,"Abstract Accounts of how homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1974 treat it as a moment of liberation and scientific progress. Economic imperatives in the 1980s, including the rise of drug companies and competition from related professions, led American psychiatrists to redefine and consolidate the profession’s status as distinct and with a unique domain. This was achieved by inducing a paradigm shift in taxonomy that was partly enabled by the struggles that led to depathologization. This paper calls into question this progress narrative of scientific knowledge production to focus instead on the power dynamics, exclusions, and processes of homogenization that have also characterized the relationship of sexuality to the DSM after depathologization. While the USA has seen the rise of much needed research into sexuality, it has also seen a tendency to flatten “LGBT” categories, understand distress in predominantly individualistic frameworks, absorb dissent within a context of increasing professionalization and bureaucratization, and create the impression of comparability across disparate frames of understanding. This paper advances a theory of how depathologization and the paradigm shift in taxonomy operated on certain neoliberal logics that have affected the understanding and management of sexual minorities in the USA."

abstract,"Abstract Public health systems in the USA and elsewhere recommend vaccination for children from birth through college. Some vaccines target diseases that are easily spread through casual contact, others—like those against hepatitis B and the human papilloma virus (HPV)—target infections spread though more intimate contact, including the exchange of bodily fluids during sexual activity. Although vaccination is very safe, it is in fact a medical intervention into the body that carries some minute risk and that requires individuals or parents to consent. As such, vaccines make for an exciting case through which to understand meanings of health, disease, sexuality, and choice in the context of neoliberalism. Using qualitative data from parents, pediatricians, and attorneys from the vaccine injury compensation system, this article first explores parents’ perceptions of these two vaccines for their children, beliefs about their children’s future sexual selves, and their goals to raise children into the kinds of sexual citizens they desire them to be. Second, the parents’ views are placed in dialogue with pediatricians’ experiences of working with parents to gain trust in the HPV vaccine, as well as barriers to providing care to teens when they become sexually active. Finally, implications for policy are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Health science research on HIV risk focuses strongly on psychological traits of individuals as determinants of health and vulnerability. This paper seeks to place these findings in a larger social context marked by neoliberalism to provide some insights into the arenas of vulnerability to risk. These arenas are shaped by shifts in the environing political economy which generate subjectivities concordant with the pressures of the neoliberal turn to increasing marketization, individualization, and responsibilization. These pressures create cultures of expectation that accentuate particular trends defining success, masculinity, and risk in contemporary societies. In other words, the “risk factors,” identified in the now voluminous research literature on HIV, cumulate in particular social locations that, at least in part, articulate with masculine gender performance in marketplaces. These intersections affect the expression of sex between men and vulnerabilities to risk, providing an alternative understanding to the deficit models currently in health science research."

abstract,"Abstract The author argues for the concept of ""gentle"" neoliberalism to account for how discourse in anti-bullying texts has increasingly presented itself as gentle and kind, while simultaneously reinforcing systems of surveillance and control. Results , based on a grounded theory analysis of 22 anti-bullying books, reveal that the texts generally decoupled bullying from power relations based on sexuality, overlooking homophobia and heteronormativity and marginalizing the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth. Further, findings demonstrate a shift over time in the texts from an explicitly harsh description of the bullies to a seemingly kinder emphasis on reporting and intervening on behalf of the individual being bullied. This shift to interventionist discourse potentially expands mechanisms of control and reinforces inequalities based on race and social class, as bystanders are increasingly held accountable and students are encouraged to report their peers to authority figures. In response to neoliberal anti-bullying discourse, the author argues for scholarship and policy solutions that undermine unequal power structures and yet also oppose surveillance strategies of monitoring, reporting, and intervening."

abstract,"Abstract This article contributes to the literature on adolescent girls’ sexual subjectivities using individual interviews conducted with 30 working-class, Latina teenagers. Latina girls’ accounts of their experiences with sexual debut, current sexual relationships, and sexual abstinence reveal that they construct sexual subjectivities through multiple forms of sexual agency; however, for some, the absence of sexual agency remains an enduring feature of their sexual experiences. The findings illustrate the contradictions embedded in Latina girls’ narratives of sexual agency whereby they often draw on dominant discourses of neoliberalism, heterosexuality, and traditional gender ideology as rhetorical strategies by which to legitimize their sexual decision-making and resist their subjectification as “at-risk” girls. The uptake of these discourses in the narratives of those marginalized at the intersections of gender, race, and class demonstrate the salience of neoliberalism as a form of disciplinary power and have implications for ongoing efforts to foster positive adolescent sexual development."

abstract,"Abstract The paper is based on the premise that neoliberalism is a political rationality that is not only anti-social but also requires an anti-democratic and violent form of statehood. However, neoliberalism is not solely based on coercion and force, but paradoxically also on consensus. This consensus is not least organized through its flexibilized and pluralized sexual politics. By focussing on sexual politics in Germany’s capital Berlin, the paper highlights that the flexibilization of the apparatus of sexuality is not merely a side effect of neoliberalism but a constitutive element of neoliberal governmentality that is deployed to legitimate an anti-democratic and violent neoliberal state. Neoliberalism uses the promise of sexual tolerance, flexibility, and pluralism in order to fulfill its anti-social, anti-democratic, and violent agenda. Furthermore, it is argued that neoliberal sexual politics require a rethinking of the concept of heteronormativity. Here, I propose to recast heteronormativity as heteronormalization."

abstract,"Abstract “Peer pressure” is associated in the scientific literature with a range of risky sexual behaviors and with undermining public sexual health messages. Interventions are instituted encouraging young people to resist peer pressure or to model positive peer norms. Taking a discursive psychology perspective, we show how young people themselves use the discourses of “peer pressure to have sex” and “peer normalization of sex” to explain and justify youth sexual activity. Using data from focus group discussions about youth sexualities with students at a South African further education and training college, we show how participants outlined a need for young people to be socially recognizable through engaging in, and talking about, sex and how they implicated peer norms in governing individual sexual behavior. Both discourses pointed to a gendering of peer-endorsed sexual norms: masculine virility, the avoidance of shameful virgin or gay positions, and multiple sexual partners were emphasized for men, while the necessity of keeping a boyfriend and avoiding a “slut” position were foregrounded for women. These discourses potentially undermine the aims of public sexual health programs targeting youth. Nuanced engagement with peer group narratives, especially how sexual activity is explained and justified in a gendered fashion, is indicated."

abstract,"Abstract Rape myths, which shift responsibility for sexual assault from the assailant to the victim, have gained prominence in American politics. Like many negative stereotypes, rape myths have a strong association with public opinion on the social groups affected by the stereotype. In this study, I investigate rape myth acceptance in the US population, differences in the causes of rape myth acceptance among men and women, and the effect of rape myths on political beliefs. I show that rape myth acceptance is significantly related to a decrease in support for access to contraception and increases opposition to abortion among male respondents. This finding is particularly significant given the current debates over women’s healthcare and the future of reproductive health policy in particular."

abstract,"Abstract This article explores what considerations members of the sadomasochistic community in Israel take into account in deciding whether to report sexual offenses and victimization to the police. This research is a qualitative study that included 20 interviews with members (men and women) of the BDSM community during 2012–2013 in Israel. The study found that members of the BDSM community in Israel have experienced sexual assault in the context of BDSM play. Respondents mentioned several reasons for not reporting this assault to the police. These reasons included fear of the victim’s being blamed, a desire to be discreet and not out themselves or others as having an interest in BDSM, shame about the practices that may have been part of the consensual part of the scene, difficulty explaining BDSM, and difficulty proving assault specifically when it requires explaining distinctions between play violence and assault. Respondents mentioned several ways that the Israeli BDSM community attempts to deal with assault and help victims, including a submissive women’s forum, a hotline that offered emotional support to victims, an informal list of people accused of assault, gossip as a way of sharing information, outing people who commit assault, and banning people from the community. Many of these considerations are common to victims of sexual assault and rape in non-BDSM contexts as well. What is different here is a layer of stigma specific to public perception of BDSM sexual interests as “deviant” or “perverse.”"

abstract,"Abstract A review of public health data for the 50 states shows that southern states including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas consistently have the highest teen pregnancy, teen birth, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates in the USA. Furthermore, these states also lack mandates regarding sexuality education; and when sexuality education is provided, abstinence must be stressed while medically accurate information is not a specific requirement. This article synthesizes findings from recent health data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Guttmacher Institute, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, and the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care with research and professional recommendations from the scientific literature. Based on the summary of these findings, the goal of this article is to provide recommendations aimed at addressing sexual health in these states, as well as other states with abstinence-only policies, to help improve the health of young people through preventing unintended pregnancy and STD transmission."

abstract,"Abstract The aims of this study are to provide momentum to research on homophobic prejudice in Czechia and to identify the significant factors influencing or mediating homophobic attitudes in Czech youth. The paper first contextualizes homophobia within the context of the Central and Eastern European countries and then refers to the role of schools and education tools in the prevention of homophobia. Results  of a quantitative analysis based on original data collected during a research survey from 9th graders (N = 1082) in 35 selected Czech elementary schools are presented in the empirical part of the paper. We identify demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and environmental factors that are significantly linked with homophobic attitudes in youth. Gender differences as well as relationship satisfaction with parents or peers, psychological status, and perception of quality of the environment one lives in were found to be among the most significant factors influencing prejudicial opinions in youth. Metropolitan youth were found to be significantly less prejudiced against nonheterosexuals. By taking lessons from abroad, we propose a number of possible policy interventions mainly in the realm of curricular documents and teacher training."

abstract,"Abstract It has been acknowledged that more research into the health and well-being of trans people is needed in order to identify important health issues. While recent studies have suggested using a two-question gender status measure to assess assigned sex at birth and gender identity, it is not well understood how participants understand and subsequently answer the questions. The study recruited a convenience sample of 50 people (25 trans and 25 cis) from the general population of Cleveland and Akron, OH. The study used cognitive interviewing methods with scripted, semi-structured and spontaneous probes when appropriate. Participants were asked to read questions out-loud, answer the questions, and explain why they answered the way they did. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed prior to analysis. The gender status questions were found to be easy to use and understood by both trans and cis participants. The two-question gender status measure was able to encompass a diversity of identities within a trans sample and be consistently answered by the study’s cis participants. The measures were able to differentiate between trans and cis groups. The two-step gender measure can be a useful tool in examining gender diversity within general population studies."

abstract,"Abstract Epidemiological categories not only reflect existing frameworks for public health, but also reify how subpopulations are defined, understood, and targeted for interventions. The sweeping categorization of Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) used in HIV research and intervention work is one such example. The current paper builds upon previous critiques of the “MSM” nomenclature by delineating the sexual and gender diversity embedded in the term as it pertains specifically to Black peoples. The emphasis is on developing greater specificity about the sociocultural and structural factors that may be shared among these subgroups, such as racism and poverty, and the factors that are likely to distinguish the groups, such as levels of sexual minority identification; access to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) services and community; and experiences with anti-bisexual or anti-transgender bias. The aim then is to provide a framework for HIV health policy work for Black sexual minority cisgender men (SMCM) and gender minorities (GMs)."

abstract,"Abstract Sexual minorities experience greater mental health issues compared with heterosexuals due to minority stressors. This study focused on the impact of victimization and neuroticism on mental health in young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and the mediating role of internalized homophobia (IH). IH refers to when a sexual minority person internalizes social bias and develops a negative view of themselves, which is a likely process through which victimization and neuroticism impact mental health. Data were collected over three time points across 12 months, with 450 YMSM (mean age = 18.9) and an 80.7 % retention rate. Two mediation analyses with bias-corrected bootstrapping using 1000 samples were conducted, controlling for age, race, and sexual orientation. Results  revealed that victimization [F (9, 440) = 4.83, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.09] and neuroticism [F (9, 440) = 12.23, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.20] had a significant indirect effect on mental health via increased levels of IH. These findings show how external experiences of stigma and personality-level characteristics may impact YMSM in terms of their sense of self. Furthermore, these results support addressing social conditions that marginalize YMSM in order to promote better mental health through decreasing IH."

abstract,"Abstract The red-blue state and urban–rural narratives—which depict that people living in red states and rural areas oppose pro-LGB policies—are popular frames for describing variation in public opinion of LGB policies by geographic region. In a test case of a red state, we examine public opinion of pro-LGB policies to assess the accuracy of the red–blue and urban–rural narratives. Using data from a survey of Nebraskans (n = 1608), we found that public opinion was more nuanced than the red state narrative allows but that urban and rural respondents reported significantly different opinions of pro-LGB policies. Rural people, however, were not unsupportive of all pro-LGB policies. Among all Nebraskans, support was higher for policies to protect LGB people from housing and job discrimination while support was lower for marriage and adoption rights. We discuss what these findings mean for public policy, urban and rural LGB individuals, and future public opinion studies of LGB issues."

We used the Modern Homophobia Scale (MHS), adapted to be more appropriate for the Italian social and cultural context. Associations were examined between homophobic attitudes, demographics, and personality characteristics and contact with lesbians and gay men. Gender issues were considered twice, from the viewpoint of both the agent and the target of the prejudice. The findings indicated that people at higher risk of possessing homonegative attitudes are older; less educated; more involved in religion and politically conservative; characterized by a more conforming, moralistic, and rule-bound personality, according to Cattell’s personality factors; and have poor contact experience with lesbians and gay men. Males tended to have higher levels of homonegativity toward gay men but not toward lesbians. Proposals to reduce antigay bias in the Italian context will be briefly discussed."

abstract,"Abstract This article contributes to the growing field of research on military LGBT policy development by exploring the case of Sweden, a non-NATO-member nation regarded as one of the most progressive in terms of the inclusion of LGBT personnel. Drawing on extensive archival work, the article shows that the story of LGBT policy development in the Swedish Armed Forces from 1944 to 2014 is one of long periods of status quo and relative silence, interrupted by leaps of rapid change, occasionally followed by the re-appearance of discriminatory policy. The analysis brings out two periods of significant change, 1971–1979 and 2000–2009, here described as turns in LGBT policy. During the first turn, the military medical regulation protocol’s recommendation to exempt gay men from military service was the key issue. During these years, homosexuality was classified as mental illness, but in the military context it was largely framed in terms of security threats, both on a national level (due to the risk of blackmail) and for the individual homosexual (due to the homophobic military environment). In the second turn, the focus was increasingly shifted from the LGBT individual to the structures, targeting the military organization itself. Furthermore, the analysis shows that there was no ban against LGBT people serving in the Swedish Armed Forces, but that ways of understanding and regulating sexual orientation and gender identity have nonetheless shaped the military organization in fundamental ways, and continue to do so."

Results  showed that effeminate gay men, that is those who enact gender non-conforming behaviors, elicited more negative emotions compared to masculine gay men both in gay and heterosexual respondents with no difference in intensity. Moreover, such negative reactions toward effeminate gay men were more extreme among gay men with high internalized sexual stigma and among heterosexuals with high self-perception of feminine traits.

Almost half the residents expressed some kind of negative reaction, ranging from calling into question the appropriateness of masturbation to extreme rejection of this sexual behavior, although positive and neutral reactions also emerged. Most participants said they would avoid interfering with the situation and that they would expect the same reaction from staff. However, reprimanding the resident in question was also mentioned. Results  are discussed in the light of privacy and group pressure issues, which could act as barriers to this kind of sexual expression in RACF. We highlight also the importance of developing formal policies and offering sex education to residents in order to preserve and promote their sexual rights and needs."

The current study conducted as descriptive included a total of 442 pregnant women who were married and at the last trimester of their pregnancy. The data were collected using a semi-structure questionnaire and face to face interview with the pregnant women and were evaluated using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Of the pregnant women, 39.8 % experienced at least one type of violence, and the most common type of violence experienced was verbal violence (31.4 %). Among the participants, 18.2 % exposed to violence expressed that their partners perpetrated violence because of jealousy, and 30.1 % reported that they just cried when exposed to violence. According to the results of the logistic regression analysis, insufficient prenatal care increases all types of violence in pregnancy. Working with pregnant women and their partners together under the scope of prenatal care services, and especially planning the attempts to prevent violence by discussing the causes of violence with couples, will facilitate more successful violence prevention programs."

This study finds that Chinese college students generally hold accepting attitudes toward homosexuality, although the extent of tolerance is limited, and is affected by various factors. Traditional cultural factors predict less tolerance for homosexuality and gay and lesbian people, whereas modernizing factors predict greater tolerance. Although both traditional and modernizing factors shape contemporary attitudes toward homosexuality in Chinese society, modernizing variables seem to have a greater impact. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract The overall thermal performance of a solar water heating (SWH) system is significantly affected by the mismatch between the temporal distribution of solar radiation and the heating load. Therefore, a favorable correlation between the collector and storage size should be generated based on the dynamic characteristics of the system. This study focuses on the optimal matching of solar collector area with storage volume for an SWH system (with short-term heat storage capability) for a space heating application. A simplified model of an SWH system based on hourly energy flow is established. System control strategy is integrated into the model in a simple manner without sacrificing computing speed. Based on this model, the combined effect of collector area and storage volume on system thermal performance and economy is analyzed, and a simple procedure for determining the optimal system size is illustrated. A case study showed that for an SWH system utilized for space heating application, the optimized ratio between storage volume and collector area is dependent on the total collector area of the system, and is dominated by the requirement of overheating prevention. The minimum storage volume for a specific collector area that can prevent the storage tank from being overheated can be adopted as the optimum storage volume for that collector area. The optimum ratio between storage volume and collector area increases as the collector area increases. Therefore, a trade-off between heat collection and heat loss has to be made while attempting to increase solar fraction by improving collector area."

abstract,"Abstract The present article describes the integration of a data-driven predictive demand response control for residential buildings with heat pump and on-site energy generation. The data driven control approach schedules the heating system of the building. In each day, the next 24 hours heating demand of buildings, including space heating and domestic hot water consumption, are predicted by means of a hybrid wavelet transformation and a dynamic neural network. Linear programming is implemented to define a cost-optimal schedule for the heat pump operation. Moreover, the study discusses the impact of heat demand prediction error on performance of demand response control. In addition, the option of energy trading with the electrical grid is considered in order to evaluate the possibility of increasing the profit for private householders through on-site energy generation. The results highlight that the application of the proposed predictive control could reduce the heating energy cost up to 12% in the cold Finnish climate. Furthermore, on-site energy generation declines the total energy cost and consumption about 43% and 24% respectively. The application of a data-driven control for the demand prediction brings efficiency to demand response control."

In this study, we developed a method to estimate the occupancy distribution in a multi-room office building using Bayesian inference. The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to estimate the real-time occupancy in individual rooms based on indoor carbon dioxide concentrations. The office building was made-up of five rooms with different physical configurations and dimensions, and the rooms were air-conditioned and ventilated by a central air handling unit. The carbon dioxide concentration data were generated by the simulation software CONTAMW according to a given schedule of occupancy and the supply airflow rates in each room. The objective of the present paper is to investigate the effects of various parameters of Bayesian inference on the accuracy of estimation results. The parameters include the probability of prior information, the uncertainty level of CO2 data, and the time interval for monitoring CO2."

abstract,"Abstract The study of ventilation windows for both natural ventilation and noise mitigation has drawn significant attention recently. This paper presents the numerical approaches to analyse the integrated thermal and acoustical performance of ventilation windows, for a residential building in tropical climate which employs double-layer noise mitigation window for natural ventilation. Given a set of outdoor wind conditions, the distributions of indoor flow and temperature fields are simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The thermal comfort is evaluated using statistical Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) method. For the acoustic performance, noise radiation from road traffic is assumed as the noise source, and the sound insulation of building façade is simulated using Finite Element Method (FEM). From the simulation results, it is found that the thermal satisfaction response is closely related to the inlet wind temperature and speed, and the window opening size greatly affects the ventilation performance. From the case study in Singapore, during certain season, day/night time and with sufficient wind flow, the ventilation window can provide enough fresh air, maintain adequate thermal comfort and quiet acoustic environment for the occupants. The numerical approaches presented in this paper are applicable to general window design studies, and the simulation findings can be incorporated into green building planning. The advantages of using simulation approaches are highlighted and their limitations are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Implicit schemes require important sub-iterations when dealing with highly nonlinear problems such as the combined heat and moisture transfer through porous building elements. The computational cost rises significantly when the whole-building is simulated, especially when there is important coupling among the building elements themselves with neighbouring zones and with HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) systems. On the other hand, the classical Euler explicit scheme is generally not used because its stability condition imposes very fine time discretisation. Hence, this paper explores the use of an improved explicit approach—the DuFort–Frankel scheme—to overcome the disadvantage of the classical explicit one and to bring benefits that cannot be obtained by implicit methods. The DuFort–Frankel approach is first compared to the classical Euler implicit and explicit schemes to compute the solution of nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through porous materials. Then, the analysis of the DuFort–Frankel unconditionally stable explicit scheme is extended to the coupled heat and moisture balances on the scale of a one- and a two-zone building models. The DuFort–Frankel scheme has the benefits of being unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time O(Δt2) and to compute explicitly the solution at each time step, avoiding costly sub-iterations. This approach may reduce the computational cost by twenty as well as it may enable perfect synchronism for whole-building simulation and co-simulation."

abstract,"Abstract Large variation in indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort can occur in partitioned office spaces due to heterogeneous air mixing. However, few published studies examined IAQ, thermal comfort, and energy performance of partitioned occupied spaces, which are commonly found in today’s buildings. The objective of this study is to evaluate indoor environmental quality and air conditioning performance of a partitioned room under two typical ventilation modes: (1) mixing ventilation and (2) displacement ventilation. For a total of six representative air-conditioning scenarios, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to examine temperature distribution, ventilation effectiveness, energy consumption, and local thermal comfort for two partitioned spaces. Simulation results indicate that temperature distribution in a partitioned room is a strong function of ventilation strategy (mixing vs. displacement), but marginally affected by diffuser arrangements. Local age-of-air (air freshness) significantly varies with both diffuser arrangement and ventilation strategy. Regarding energy consumption, displacement ventilation can achieve an indoor set-point temperature in the partitioned spaces about two times faster than mixing ventilation. Under mixing ventilation, the time to achieve a set-point temperature was notably reduced when each partitioned space is served by its own diffuser. For the same supply airflow rate, displacement ventilation can generate local draft risk at ankle level, while mixing ventilation may result in a draft sensation in wider areas around an occupant. Overall, the results suggest that mixing ventilation system can save energy if each partitioned zone is served by its own diffuser such as a multi-split air conditioning. However, when multiple partitioned zones are served by only one diffuser, displacement ventilation is more energy-efficient and can achieve higher ventilation effectiveness than mixing ventilation."

abstract,"Abstract This work presents a numerical study of the combined effects of the hysteresis temperature difference, peak melting temperature, and thickness of a building envelope PCM-wall on its thermal performance in air-conditioning and non-air-conditioning conditions. The study was carried out considering complete melting-freezing daily cycles of the PCM in a climate exhibiting both hot and cold thermal discomfort. A time-dependent one-dimensional heat conduction code, which uses the effective specific heat method to simulate the heat transfer through the PCM was developed. Insights into the effects of the hysteresis phenomenon were obtained; it was found that hysteresis improves the thermal performance of PCM-walls. The higher the hysteresis temperature difference the better the thermal performance, but there is a limit in the improvement of the thermal performance, which is achieved when the entire phase change process takes place at temperatures outside of the thermal comfort zone. Maximum improvements from 4% to 29% for air-conditioning and from 4% to 30% for non-air-conditioning, for a BioPCM wall with thicknesses from 6 mm to 18 mm, were found. Suggested criteria to achieve the maximum possible thermal performance of PCM-walls given a thickness and use condition were obtained. This work proposes the basis of a methodology to optimize simultaneously any pair of variables of a PCM-wall for different use conditions (AC, nAC, or a combined use of AC and nAC)."

The proposed model is intended to be efficient and adaptable to address one of the major challenges in climate change research: some uncertainties prevail now but will be resolved gradually as time passes. The applicability and practicality of the model are illustrated and tested by a wooden church equipped with well designed and high precision measurements. Model predictions and forecasts are in good agreement to the measurements despite the description of the dynamic model is simple. The model is further applied to a future projection of climate indoors to examine future climate impacts on buildings and to assess the climatic suitability of wood for providing a mechanism that can facilitate the reduction of climate risks and be more resilient to global warming. The paper suggests that wood building materials offer an effective and resilient response to anticipated future climate changes. While predominantly focused on wooden buildings, the model is general enough for other types of buildings."

abstract,"Abstract The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of solar radiation models on the determination of energy performance of a single-family house assisted with renewable energy system including photovoltaic panels and solar water heater. An Angström-Prescott type solar radiation model was compared with Zhang and Huang model derived based on hourly meteorological data of 12 locations in Turkey. Since regression coefficients of the Zhang and Huang model are valid for China, new regression coefficients were derived by using local meteorological data. A clear distinction could not be observed in simulated annual heating load intensity for each model since the average relative deviation of the models’ results was 2.5%. However, the average deviation was 12.5% for space cooling load intensity. Primary energy ratings (PER) and the renewable energy ratio (RER) were determined for each location. For total PER, the highest deviation was 4.6% and 3.3% for Mersin and Muğla, respectively. For the other locations, this parameter deviates between 0.02%–2.11%. The highest RER was 18.6% for Mersin."

abstract,"Abstract The simultaneous impact of massing on both energy consumption and renewable energy production potential is studied by taking the case of office buildings in Washington D.C. A Baseline design with a square footprint is compared with eleven massing alternatives: three rectangular parallelepiped designs with aspect ratios of respectively 2, 3, and 4, along the east-west orientation; three rectangular parallelepiped designs with aspect ratios of respectively 2, 3, and 4, along the north-south orientation; two H-shaped designs; one cross-shaped design; and two pyramidal buildings with wall slopes of respectively 86° and 83°. With differences between the best performing massing alternative and the worst performing massing alternative of more than 10% in terms of energy consumption, and more than 20% in terms of renewable energy production, massing is found to significantly impact both energy use and energy production. Consideration of both energy consumption and renewable energy production potential suggests that, for temperate climates such as Washington D.C., buildings with H-shaped footprints, buildings with crossshaped footprints, and buildings with high aspect ratio footprints are preferable when targeting net-zero energy status."

abstract,"Abstract For a sudden contaminant release in an indoor environment, source localization can provide critical information for preventing and mitigating indoor air pollution and its related health and security problems. Considerable research has focused on locating indoor contaminant sources with instantaneous or constant release rates; however, few studies on locating indoor sources with time-varying release rates have been reported. This study proposed a multi-robot active olfactory method for promptly locating time-varying sources in 3D indoor environments. The method extends our previously proposed method for 2D indoor environments by redefining and reprogramming it in a 3D coordinate system and proposing a 3D source declaration algorithm. Via more than 200 numerical experiments in 3D indoor environments with mixing, displacement, and piston ventilation systems, the method was fully demonstrated and validated. The results show the applicability and reliability of the method and reveal the effects of space style, ventilation mode, source release rate, source location, and obstacle layout on source localization."

Coupled finite difference and finite volume based open source solver, Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is used for domain discretization and solution of governing equations. Heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA) is varied in the single room case and temperature and visibility contours are studied to determine HRRPUA corresponding to maximum hazard, judged based on available safe evacuation time (ASET) calculation. Further, positions of air conditioners, at a prescribed HRRPUA, are varied in two interconnected rooms to obtain the case with maximum ASET. Evacuation strategy is discussed and the maximum number of persons who can be safely evacuated from the accident site is calculated followed by the variation in the position of doors in the case with inter-connected doors attached with a corridor. Soot flow pattern and flame contours are also observed for each of the above cases. At the end, fire breakout is simulated in a two-storeyed building with stairs and having the room configuration based on the maximum ASET value."

abstract,"Abstract Green roofs (GRs) and green walls (GWs) are good strategies for urban greenery. This study explores the cooling load benefits of GRs and GWs simultaneously for comparison. EnergyPlus simulation programme is used for estimating annual cooling load reduction for different buildings and scenarios in Hong Kong. In simulating GR, a built-in thermal model is used. For GWs, a self-developed thermal model is used, which has been developed and validated in our previous study. The simulation covers a single-storey building and two multi-storey buildings, each with four different coverage areas for GR and GWs. The GWs are assumed to be on building facade facing the west, east, north, and south. Results  reveal that both GRs and GWs are capable of protecting building envelop from reaching higher temperatures and of reducing cooling load. In a single-storey building with an equal area of GR and GW, GR is more effective in energy saving. However, in a multi-storey building GR can provide energy benefits only to the topmost floor. An equal area of GW can provide benefits to multiple floors, which may result in higher benefit. Furthermore, the available area for GWs is larger. When considering the effect of orientation of GW, the west-facing GW contributes to the highest annual energy saving. It should be noted that the effect of orientation may differ with location and climatic conditions, and also with the shading effect of surrounding buildings. Therefore, installation of GRs or GWs should be considered case by case, taking into consideration the scale and surroundings of the building, the climatic condition, and area of greenery coverage."

abstract,"Abstract In hospital isolation rooms, door operation can lead to containment failures and airborne pathogen dispersal into the surrounding spaces. Sliding doors can reduce the containment failure arising from the door motion induced airflows, as compared to the hinged doors that are typically used in healthcare facilities. Such airflow leakage can be measured quantitatively using tracer gas techniques, but detailed observation of the turbulent flow features is very difficult. However, a comprehensive understanding of these flows is important when designing doors to further reduce such containment failures. Experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, by using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) flow solver, were used to study airflow patterns in a full-scale mock-up, consisting of a sliding door separating two identical rooms (i.e. one isolation room attached to an antechamber). A single sliding door open/ hold-open/ closing cycle was studied. Additional variables included human passage through the doorway and imposing a temperature difference between the two rooms. The general structures of computationally-simulated flow features were validated by comparing the results to smoke visualizations of identical full-scale experimental set-ups. It was found that without passage the air volume leakage across the doorway was first dominated by vortex shedding in the wake of the door, but during a prolonged hold-open period a possible temperature difference soon became the predominant driving force. Passage generates a short and powerful pulse of leakage flow rate even if the walker stops to wait for the door to open."

abstract,"Abstract Although energy simulation can provide valuable information about building energy behavior, the inaccuracy of input data can undermine the reliability of the results. Despite the vast literature about uncertainty analysis, little is known about the influence of building characteristics on the propagation of uncertainty through the energy simulation models. This study investigates the extent to which uncertain thermal conductivity and specific heat of structural layers affect the annual heating and cooling needs for a set of 144 simplified reference building configurations in three European climates. The analysis is carried out by means of a Monte Carlo technique coupled with TRNSYS hourly simulations. This study points out that the uninsulated residential buildings with a high aspect ratio, a small transparent surface with south exposure and low SHGC are more sensitive in the cooling needs estimation to the propagation of uncertainty in material properties. Similarly, the heating needs precision is greatly reduced when the uncertainty affects the thermal conductivity in uninsulated buildings with a low aspect ratio, a high SHGC and small window size. On the contrary, the uncertainty in specific heat is emphasized in buildings with external insulation having large windows oriented to either east or south and with glazing characterized by high SHGC."

abstract,"Abstract Despite the research advances and demonstrated benefit of occupant modelling and simulation in recent years, its uptake in building simulation practice has been relatively slow. One of the underlying causes of this issue is limited occupant-related features of building performance simulation (BPS) tools. To this end, we present a detailed breakdown of occupant-related features and compare them between common BPS tools. Based on the outcomes of a stakeholder workshop, and an international survey that focused on occupant modelling, we provide detailed recommendations to improve occupant-related features in BPS tools. We finally present a case study demonstrating the suggested occupant-related features to apply multiple occupancy assumptions, and integrate occupant behaviour models from the literature. Results  are presented as part of a non-functional mock-up graphical user interface (GUI) to demonstrate potential features of BPS tools given the suggested occupant-related improvements. These suggested improvements for BPS tools would enable users to quickly assess proposed designs’ sensitivity to different occupancy scenarios, and ultimately increase the robustness of their final designs. The presented recommendations are relevant to practitioners, researchers, and BPS tool developers as part of the efforts to increase the uptake of detailed occupant modelling in building simulation practice."

The algorithm is based on the improvement of simple Genetic Algorithm (GA). The concept of Adaptive Radiation (AR) is derived from the biological process of adaptation where specific species are evolutionarily adapted to their immediate ecological niches. This algorithm obtains near global optimal solutions in significantly less computation time than simple GA. AR is implemented in three different climates in the United States to demonstrate its robustness and efficiency. Climate adaptive facade design strategies for these climates are illustrated based on the optimization results.

abstract,"Abstract This research originated from an interest in developing products with a holistic and interdisciplinary systems engineering approach, toward fostering sustainability. A comprehensive method which helps designers make better decisions in the earliest design stage was applied for conceptual model development and comparison. The study developed a new-design passive house with a double-skin envelope that delivers better energy consumption performance for heating and cooling relative to a conventional reference house, while achieving comfort-level indoor temperatures. A single-façade reference house was designed with the identical geometry, material and conditions of the new house living quarters, in order to demonstrate the new house performance using a valid comparison. The new house and reference house were simulated cases and were not calibrated by actual models. The energy simulations demonstrated that the heating and cooling demands of the new house were 19.1% and 18.8% lower than those of the reference house, respectively. Furthermore, fluid dynamics behavior of the air inside the double-skin envelope was analyzed to demonstrate the airflow’s contribution to the energy performance. Computational fluid dynamics simulations revealed that turbulent airflow in the underground space on summer day increased heat transfer, and laminar airflow in the double-skin roof on winter night decreased such transfer."

abstract,"Abstract Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) have proven to be an energy-efficient solution to achieve optimal indoor thermal environment in buildings. This solution uses the building mass to store heat and by means of water pipes embedded in the concrete slabs adjust the temperature in the premises. The active surfaces of TABS need to be as exposed as possible, but exposing bare concrete surfaces has a negative impact on the acoustic quality in the premises. Acoustic solutions capable of providing optimal acoustic comfort while allowing the heat exchange between the TABS and the room are desirable. This study focuses on the influence of two types of free-hanging ceiling absorbers (horizontal and vertical) on the cooling performance of the TABS. Different scenarios are investigated for each type of sound absorber. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to illuminate the nature of the heat exchange between the TABS and the room and the occupants. The simulations are validated by comparison with full scale measurements in laboratory conditions. The study shows that for equivalent sound absorption levels, free-hanging vertical sound absorbers have a lower impact on the heat exchange between the room and the TABS compared to free-hanging horizontal sound absorbers. Cold air stagnation between the sound absorber units and the TABS has been identified as the major cause of the cooling performance decrease of the TABS."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a graph- and feature-based building space recognition algorithm for a boundary representation format (B-rep) geometric model, which can identify the building element type and space. The flow of the algorithm is described in detail, including the construction of a building geometric topology relation graph (BTG), the recognition of building element type, and the extraction of building space based on graph and local feature. The algorithm can be applied to the design of a building scheme; it can quickly identify and transform the geometric model into the input model required by the performance simulation software. This is a key step in realizing a performance-oriented design in the early design stage. We implemented this algorithm using SketchUp for testing its performance. Through the case study, it is proved that the algorithm can recognize the model and extract all the building spaces accurately. There is linear correlation between the recognition time and number of faces. Moreover, at the time of analysis, a model composed of 500 spaces and 3001 faces did not exceed 1.69 s, which meets the requirements of most applications well. Compared to previous works, this algorithm performs well in both recognition accuracy and time efficiency simultaneously, and can better serve the actual demand of automatic real-time building performance feedback in the early design stage. Finally, the future work regarding performance-oriented design based on model recognition is proposed."

It is shown that the processing time savings obtained with the automation process increase exponentially as the number of design factors considered increases. The regression equations between heating and cooling loads and design factors are analyzed with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to obtain the Pareto-front, which is a combination of optimal design factors that can be used to minimize the building heating and cooling loads and to provide building designers with viable alternatives by considering the building energy performance."

abstract,"Abstract The demand for general reduction of the energy consumption in civil engineering leads to more frequent use of insulating materials with air gaps or cavities. Heat transfer through a constructional part can be decreased by adding an air gap and low emissivity reflective foils to the structure. In the first part of this paper, the impacts of cavity thickness and inner surface emissivity on combined conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer was experimentally explored in the case of constructional part with a horizontal cavity subjected to constant downward heat flux. The heat flow meter Netzsch HFM 436 Lambda was used for steady-state measurements. Results  suggest that the studied parameters seriously affect the combined heat transfer in the composed structure. In the second part the paper reports the numerical study of two-dimensional conjugate heat transfer in closed horizontal cavity having air as the intervening medium. Numerical models validated by related experimental results were performed to further investigate the effect of radiation heat transfer. It was found that in general, the total heat flux through the composed structure decreases with increasing air cavity thickness, which is significant especially when low emissivity inner surfaces are taking into account. The direction of heat flow (downward or upward heat flow) has a significant impact on the convection heat transfer. An important contribution from the present work is the analysis of the optimal thickness of the cavity at different boundary conditions. The optimal thickness of the enclosure with low emissivity surfaces is 16 mm when subjected to upward heat flux."

The concentration variations of tracer gas inside the models were measured by a gas chromatography, and the external and internal pressures were determined by a multi-channel pressure scanner. The verified transport model was then applied to evaluate the influences of external wind speed, initial concentration, opening areas and interior volume on the transient concentration and dispersion time of gaseous pollutants within a two-room buildings. Results  of the parametric study indicate that the dispersion time and the ratio of the maximum concentration in the adjacent room to the initial concentration of the room with the pollutant source was about 0.50–0.60, depending on the ventilation rate and interior volume."

abstract,"Abstract Due to the data deficiency in developing countries like China, the calculation of the building production phase only considers a few major materials. To solve this problem, three indexes are put forward, which are cost-based energy, cost-based exergy and cost-based carbon, and a new concept, the equivalent coefficient of thermodynamic cost, is presented based on social economic indicator, energy intensity. Then a thermodynamic method is built up to estimate the energy, exergy consumption and CO2 emission of building materials in production phase. Compared to the conventional calculation, this thermodynamic method takes full account of every material in the BOQ (bill of quantity), and the data used in the method, energy intensity, can be found in government publications. The production phase of the case building is analyzed using this method, and results show that the production phase accounts for 12.34% of the life cycle energy consumption, also contributes 15.48% towards the life cycle CO2 emissions. The embodied energy of the case building is about 4.995 GJ/m2 which matches the results from other LCA research, thus verifies the validity of the proposed calculation. This method is practical and significant in improving sustainable building assessment tools and enacting energy policies in building sector."

abstract,"Abstract Terraced apartments as a typology of the buildings are new approaches to meet energy conservation targets. This principle in the form of interactive spaces contributes to an incorporation of interior and exterior, daylight addition and exploitation of natural ventilation. This study mainly investigates the natural ventilation exploitation of a terraced apartment in the hot and humid region. One solid block and 4 porous apartments with different terrace depths (TD) are evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The k-ε turbulence model was adapted to simulate airflow in and around a mid-rise building with 42 residential blocks. CFD analysis compares the effect of permeability in the form of terraces on wind behaviour and natural ventilation efficiency in a mid-rise building. Ventilation assessment parameters such as mean air velocity and mean age of air are measured to compare the natural ventilation performance. The simulation results clearly indicate that the implementation of permeability in the form of terraces can enhance building natural ventilation performance significantly. However, it is proved that some physical configurations such as terrace depth can influence this performance greatly. According to the results, increasing the terrace depth up to 1.2 meters will enhance the mean wind velocity 40%–88% inside the room, 10.61%–12.29% near the window and 63.44% on the openings. Velocity diagram follows a descending process after TD 1.2. The mean wind speed decreases to 25.53% inside the room, 15.09% inside terraces and 1.09% near the window. The average wind velocity on the openings is revealed to be 1.54 to 1.64 times larger in the porous models than the solid one. On the other hand, porous cases indicate lower values for the mean age of air compared to the solid model. This study provides proper guidelines to predict ventilation performance and to improve the design of naturally ventilated mid-rise buildings in hot and humid regions."

abstract,"Abstract This study determined the vertical temperature gradient in two large industrial buildings with room height close to 10 m. One of the buildings was an assembly hall with air heating system and the other was a warehouse equipped with radiant heating (primary) and air heating (secondary) system. The objective of the study was to determine the differences of vertical temperature gradient in halls during the winter. The findings from this study were used in dynamic whole-year simulations for estimating the heating and ventilation energy differences. The results showed about 0.2 K/m vertical temperature gradients in both halls, which was smaller by a factor of 5 for air heating than guidebook. This difference was likely because of the building being ventilated and well insulated. Temperature gradients kept reasonably constant at all measured outdoor temperatures. Energy simulations with measured gradient values of 0.2 K/m and with outdoor airflow rate during occupied hours 1.0 L/(s·m2), which was enough for ventilation and for air heating with simulated good insulation level, resulted in 15% to 41% higher primary energy for air heating. If it is possible to lower outdoor airflow rates to 0.5 L/(s·m2) during occupied hours, which was enough to remove pollutants from occupancy, the analyzed cases showed 23% lower primary energy for radiant heating."

abstract,"Abstract Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the condition of a building’s internal environment that is related to the occupants’ health, comfort, and wellbeing. The assessment and improvement of IEQ in buildings are based on either subjective or objective assessment or the use of both measures, and in recent times, have been attracting attention due to its role in contributing to green building and sustainable environment. This study is aimed at evaluating and analysing the validity of the IEQ parameter traits as assessed using subjective and objective measures. The convergent and discriminant validity of the measured parameter traits were tested by analysing a multitrait–multimethod (MTMM) matrix using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results indicated that there is no convergent validity in the IEQ parameter traits as assessed using subjective and objective methods. However, discriminant validity of the measured parameter traits was adequately supported. This clearly shows that as much as IEQ parameter traits measured through objective physical measurement and subjective occupant survey define the same concept, they cannot be taken to represent a single and same unit of measurement."

abstract,"Abstract Thermal comfort standards are required not only to ensure good indoor climatic condition, but also to optimize the energy used in a building for heating or cooling purposes. Generally, Fanger’s Predicted Mean Vote–Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PMV–PPD) model is used by designers and architects to estimate the comfort condition and hence the setpoint temperature inside a building. However, the recent field survey based studies on adaptive thermal comfort suggests that the above used PMV model frequently either underestimates or overestimates the thermal sensation due to the non-inclusion of the adaptive opportunities that a subject may have in maintaining comfortable condition. This leads to often an estimation of higher or lower setpoint temperature than that actually required for maintaining comfort, thereby consuming higher energy. The aim of the research is to study the effect of difference in elevation which is a major factor for temperature difference in hilly terrain, on the thermal comfort of residents. We conducted a field survey in 6 residential buildings at two different elevations in the Darjeeling Himalayan Region of north east India. A total of 1017 questionnaires regarding the indoor occupant thermal comfort were collected from 46 subjects during the monthly survey held in the year 2015. Variations in clothing insulation and other thermal comfort parameters were seen both with difference in elevation and with outdoor environmental conditions."

abstract,"Abstract Youth housing prototypes are widely spread all over Egypt as a cheap economic housing for youth which are designed in a number of different shapes. A post occupancy evaluation (POE) has been conducted to one of these prototypes to assess some modifications spontaneously done by users to the original design for the sake of enhancing building performance, e.g., creating new openings to improve lighting and natural ventilation thermal comfort, and making sunshades to control direct sunlight and thermal radiation. These assessments have been validated using simulation techniques i.e. CFD, thermal and daylight simulations, to compare natural ventilation, thermal comfort, and daylight energy efficiency in the original designs to that in the user modified. A wind tunnel test has been conducted to validate the standard k–epsilon turbulence CFD simulation in addition to daylighting in-situ measurements to validate natural lighting. The outcome of this research could be widely used as an important feedback tool in the future designs of the same prototype to evaluate user behaviour role in building performance efficiency. The research showed that some of these behaviours has improved thermal comfort by 60% to 87% from the original design while daylight efficiency has been improved by 31.8% to 41.4% while sensible cooling loads’ improvement ranges from 27.4% to 77.2% for the northern zone and 29.9% to 91.6% for the southern one, and thus, it could be used as a reliable POE feedback tool."

Characteristic curves of the fan were obtained, and then simulation results were successfully validated compared to experimental data. Three types of grilles (a circular grille, a rectangular grille, and a proposed novel grille) were evaluated and comprised with two parameters of non-dimensional aero-dynamic and air throw distances. Results  indicated the superiority of proposed grille and circular grille, respectively in two mentioned parameters. Increment of the deflecting-ring’s width increased the non-dimensional aero-dynamic performance, the efficiency, and the turbulence intensity and vice versa. Decrement of deflecting ring’s width led to decreasing in these parameters except turbulence intensity. Besides, condenser blockage made a decrease in the non-dimensional aero-dynamic performance and increase in the total pressure coefficient."

abstract,"Abstract Models describing energy consumption, heating, and cooling of buildings usually impose difficulties to the numerical integration algorithms used to simulate them. Stiffness and the presence of frequent discontinuities are among the main causes of those difficulties, that become critical when the models grow in size. Quantized State Systems (QSS) methods are a family of numerical integration algorithms that can efficiently handle discontinuities and stiffness in large models. For this reason, they are promising candidates for overcoming the mentioned problems. Based on this observation, this article studies the performance of QSS methods in some systems that are relevant to the field of building simulation. The study includes a performance comparison of different QSS algorithms against state-of-the-art classic numerical solvers, showing that the former can be more than one order of magnitude faster."

abstract,"Abstract Calculation and measurement-based energy performance evaluations of the same building often provide different results. This difference is referred as “the performance gap”. However, a large performance gap may not necessarily mean that there are flaws in the building or deviations from the intended design. The causes for the performance gap can be analysed by calibrating the simulation model to measured data. In this paper, an approach is introduced for verifying compliance with energy performance criteria of residential buildings. The approach is based on a performance gap analysis that takes the uncertainties in the energy evaluation methods into consideration. The scope is to verify building energy performance through simulation and analysis of measured data, identifying any performance gap due to deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building based on performance gap analysis. In the approach, a simulation model is calibrated to match the heat loss coefficient of the building envelope [kWh/K] instead of the measured energy. The introduced approach is illustrated using a single-family residential building. The heat loss coefficient was found useful towards identifying any deviations from the intended design or flaws in the finished building. The case study indicated that the method uncertainty was important to consider in the performance gap analysis and that the proposed approach is applicable even when the performance gap appears to be non-existing."

abstract,"Abstract In this article, a building electric energy prediction model using a Kriging method was developed for an efficient building energy management system (BEMS). In the prediction model, only easily obtainable weather factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. were used as input parameters for actual application to the BEMS. In order to identify the effects of weather factors on building energy consumption, two data mining techniques were used: Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The accuracy of the model using only easily obtain weather factors was compared with that of the model using the weather factors selected based on the results of data mining. According to the results, the building electric energy prediction model using only easily obtainable weather factors has sufficient predictive ability for BEMS. The developed building electric energy prediction model was applied to the optimization problem of charge/ discharge scheduling for an electric energy storage system. The results showed that the building electric energy prediction model has sufficient accuracy for application to the BEMS."

abstract,"Abstract Many airborne infectious diseases can be transmitted via exhaled contaminants transported in the air. Direct exposure occurs when the exhaled jet from the infected person directly enters the breathing zone of the target person. Indirect exposure occurs when the contaminants disperse in the room and are inhaled by the target person. This paper presents a simple method for differentiating the direct and indirect exposure to exhaled contaminants in mechanically ventilated rooms. Experimental data for 191 cases were collected from the literature. After analyzing the data, a simple method was developed to differentiate direct and indirect exposure in mixing and displacement ventilated rooms. The proposed method correctly differentiated direct and indirect exposure for 120 out of the 133 mixing ventilation cases and 47 out of the 58 displacement ventilation cases. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for use at the early design stage to quickly assess whether there will be direct exposure to exhaled contaminants in a mechanically ventilated room."

abstract,"Abstract A novel integrated personalized ventilation and local fan-induced active chilled beam (PV-ACB) air conditioning system is proposed and analyzed through energy and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation methods. Energy performance and indoor environmental conditions of this system are investigated via Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) and ANSYS Fluent respectively. Energy simulation results illustrate that PV-ACB system, compared with the conventional variable air volume (VAV) system, could achieve 16% energy savings at 100% peak cooling load. A maximum 42% energy savings is obtained at 25% part cooling load, indicating the superior energy saving potential under part load conditions. Vertical thermal stratification is observed in CFD simulation results, 23–24 °C at the occupant level (0–2 m) and 26–27 °C in the upper zone (2–4 m). Horizontally, temperature around occupants is 22–23 °C, lower than the temperature of 26–27 °C in other areas, demonstrating the horizontal temperature difference caused by the conditioned outdoor air from personalized ventilation. Both energy and CFD simulation results illustrate that this novel PV-ACB air conditioning system is able to achieve considerable energy savings, superior occupant thermal comfort and enhanced indoor air quality (IAQ)."

abstract,"Abstract Creating a micro-environment around infected occupants constitutes an effective strategy in reducing contaminants spread insuring a relatively clean macroclimate decreasing the risk of infection for occupants circulating in an office space. In this work, the ability of ceiling personalized ventilation (CPV) system assisted by desk fans (DF) or chair fans (CF) was studied with respect to confining contaminants spread in typical office space while considering possible occupant shift. A 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate particle spread. The developed model was validated experimentally with respect to concentration values using a thermal manikin in a climatic chamber with controlled particle generation. A parametric study was followed to determine the effect of the occupant shift from CPV design position, the CPV+DF or CF configuration, and the canopy angle on confinement performance for minimal particle spread in the space. The CPV jet and diffusers’ flow canopy favored particle deposition within the microclimate region leading to their removal from indoor air. For no occupant shift, assisting the CPV jet by DF or CF was very efficient in particle confinement. However, in the cases of critical backward occupant shift, flow asymmetry was formed around the occupant leading to particle spread and leading to asymmetry attenuation when operated with CF. The highest particle confinement was obtained for a canopy angle of 45° for the case of CPV assisted by CF due to forming a recirculation zone between the CPV and jet diffusers; hence trapping particles and reducing their spread to the macroclimate. It was found that a total supply flow rate of 60 L/s for MV is required compared to 43.5 L/s for the optimal CPV design, for equivalent average particle concentration within the macroclimate zone at the critical generation plane, leading to 62% reduction in power consumption of the supply fan."

abstract,"Abstract Fully glazed building façades often experience high solar heat gains and daylight transmission, resulting in high cooling energy consumption and visual discomfort. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of perforated exterior louvers for controlling solar heat gains through a fenestration system, providing visual comfort to the occupant and improving the energy performance of an office space in distinct climates (tropical, semiarid, humid subtropical, continental) based on integrated thermal and lighting simulations. The louvers evaluated have 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% perforations with 120 and 240 mm louver spacing. This study demonstrates the potential of perforated exterior louvers for controlling solar heat gains and daylight transmission to improve the visual comfort of the occupant and the building energy consumption. Since perforations can significantly influence office performance and occupant comfort, it is crucial for an evaluation of this type of louver to be completed in the early design stages with integrated thermal and lighting simulation tools that are able to address the complex thermal and optical properties of the louvers. Louvers with 120 mm spacing and 5%–20% perforations reduce office energy consumption by 15%–63% (depending on the city) compared with an unshaded window while meeting the visual comfort criteria (sDA300/50% between 96% and 100%, ASE4000/400h of 0% and DGPs perception class A). Additionally, the percentage of perforations and spacing of louvers significantly impact the evaluated performance criteria. CFSs fully cover the window but have evenly distributed perforations outperform shading devices with larger spacing between louvers and louvers without perforations."

abstract,"Abstract Apartment buildings in major Canadian cities make the largest share of the residential stock. However, their poor performance is often characterized by indoor thermal discomfort conditions and high-energy consumptions. Therefore, decreasing the energy demand of high-rise residential buildings through energy retrofits is critical. In the recent years, the adoption of thermal energy storage has often been proposed to stabilize indoor temperatures and to reduce the energy demand for space conditioning in buildings. In this study, the benefits of passive latent thermal energy storage systems are investigated by integrating phase change materials (PCMs) into walls and ceilings of apartment units. A hybrid PCM system with a thickness of 2 cm composed of two PCM products with melting temperatures of 21.7 °C and 25 °C respectively, is investigated. The effectiveness of this composite PCM system is evaluated by quantifying the changes in indoor temperatures and energy demands for apartment buildings in the climate conditions of Toronto and Vancouver. A parametric analysis considering the building window to wall ratios, orientations and temperature set points is performed using simulations done with EnergyPlusTM. The results show that the composite PCM system improves the indoor temperatures in both climates by reducing temperature fluctuations and balancing temperature peaks. Overall, the adoption of this system results in the reduction of cooling energy demand by 6% in Toronto and 31.5% in Vancouver. The results showed the benefit of applying two PCM melting points in one zone as an effective method for annual indoor temperature regulation, especially in Toronto."

abstract,"Abstract This study aims to evaluate thermal performance of a new ventilated Trombe wall integrated with phase change materials (PCMs-VTW). Double PCM wallboards are embedded in the building facade for different purposes, i.e. exterior PCM wallboard is to store natural cooling energy via night-time ventilation, and interior active PCM wallboard is for radiant cooling. Melting temperature and latent heat of PCM have been discussed for PCMs-VTW system from 1st August to 7th August in Changsha, China. Also, high-reflective coating is coated on the exterior PCM wallboard for reflecting solar radiation, thus ameliorating daytime overheating. Nighttime ventilation is for natural cooling energy storage via regenerating solid exterior PCM wallboard. The obtained result shows that under the weather condition in Changsha, melting temperature 22 °C for interior PCM and the latent heat 176 kJ/kg for exterior PCM show considerable benefit for cooling energy release. Compared with the classical Trombe wall system, annual cooling energy consumption is decreased by 20.8% and by 18.6% in the PCMs-VTW system when indoor air temperature is kept at 22 °C and 24 °C respectively. Our research has provided scientific evidences for potentials provided by PCMs-VTW system in reducing building energy consumption and improving indoor thermal comfort via exploiting natural cooling energy, mitigating overheating at summer condition and utilizing cold sources in high temperature."

abstract,"Abstract This paper explored the transition of flow in an elevator shaft and analyzed how the gas flow is affected by the moving elevator car during a building fire. A 3D model was built through ANSYS Fluent, the elevator motion was resolved through dynamic mesh theory. Flow fields in the elevator shaft were compared to describe the flow transition. Pressure distributions were applied to explain how the transition was accomplished and how the gas flow was influenced by the moving elevator car. Chemical reaction in the room released large amounts of CO2 and CO. The change in CO2 and CO concentration in the shaft was applied to measure the influence of elevator motion on the flow. At the start of the simulation, the gas moved slowly and smoothly upwards in the area between the elevator car and the top. As the elevator car moved, this area shrank steadily and significantly. In the end, this area disappeared and the transition of flow status in the entire shaft had been accomplished. The elevator motion decreased the pressure inside the shaft as well as the lobby. While the elevator car moved upwards with 1.75 m/s, the pressure in the lobby was decreased by 142.9% while the CO2 and CO concentration was increased compared to the case with still elevator cars, which indicated that more fire smoke flew into the lobby when the elevator car moved in the shaft."

abstract,"Abstract This study reports on developing an innovative approach for the parametric analysis of daylighting and visual comfort, through a sun responsive shading system. The objective is estimating the annual daylight metrics and indoor glare discomfort. To this end, a review of the literature was carried out on three key concepts: smart facades, visual comfort, and parametric design, in order to develop a dynamic pattern of an oriental system for enhancing the daylight and visual performance. Afterwards, two geometrical components (Rosette modules and louvers) were applied, using Grasshopper plug-in for Rhino and daylighting plug-in DIVA, to investigate the indoor daylight quality through different geometrical and physical properties. This resulted in generating 6480 design variants, when several variables (rotation, distance to facade, time hours, transmittance properties and colors) that affect incoming daylight as well as visual comfort performance in a single office space in the hot-arid climate of Tehran were taken into account. Interactive correlations between the overall performance of kinetic patterns and visual performance were investigated through an optimization process. Analyses showed that the proposed approach is capable of significantly improving the shading flexibility to control daylight metrics and glare, via a full potential adaptive pattern to achieve the maximum visual comfort level based on LEEDv4 certificate."

abstract,"Abstract Decisions made at the early design stage have tremendous impacts on building performance (energy consumption, daylight, life cycle cost, natural ventilation, sunshine hours, etc.). Owing to progress in the design process, the opportunity to improve building performance is constantly reducing, while the cost of optimization is constantly increasing. The literature review shows that the commonly used building performance optimization workflow is divided into two categories: the forward optimization workflow and the inverse optimization workflow. In the forward workflow, designers are allowed to optimize building schemes according to feedback gleaned from the performance metrics; in the inverse workflow, however, designers are allowed to utilize software to search for optimal design solutions. Both workflows have their advantages, and their collective advantages can result in a highly efficient building design; however, in practice, the two processes are often separated. Furthermore, the simulation engines used in these two workflows are simulation software quite widely used. Using these software often requires a large amount of information, which are not suitable for an early design. In this paper, a bidirectional workflow for building performance optimization at the early design stage is proposed. The building energy consumption prediction model is then improved to make the workflow provide real-time performance feedback, and the optimization workflow is realized in SketchUp. This approach can provide quick feedback from building performance metrics, and allows designers to search for optimal solutions, using a genetic algorithm to support early design decisions. Because of the different structures of the simplified model and the standard model in BESTEST, we chose to use the results of DesignBuilder as the baseline to calibrate the simplified model. The model verification results show that the relative deviation of the total energy consumption of working condition 1 and 2 is between 20% and 27% due to the relatively large heating deviation in Beijing. The relative deviation of the total energy consumption of other cities is within 10%. In future work, we plan to rebuild the codes of the simplified model, and perform energy calibration under the standard procedure in BESTEST. Finally, the workflow is illustrated through a case study. Compared to previous studies, through the inverse-forward workflow and the simplified energy prediction model, the proposed workflow is demonstrated to better provide fast performance optimization at the early design stage."

abstract,"Abstract Detailed airflow information around a building can be crucial for the design of naturally ventilated systems and for exhaust air dispersion practices in agricultural buildings like greenhouses and livestock buildings. Full-scale measurements are cost-intensive and difficult to achieve due to varied wind conditions. A common method to gain insight of flow field under different wind conditions is the numerical simulation by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Still, evaluation of a CFD models’ performance and validation of its predictions with high quality experimental data is necessary before the model is used in practice. In this research three types of common agricultural buildings, arched-type, pitched-type and flat-type roof, were examined by conducting experiments in a wind tunnel with controlled airflow conditions, in order to validate different 3D turbulence models for predicting airflow patterns. The focus of this work was the detailed description of the external airflow field over the varied roof geometries and especially the velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of each building. Experimental measurements of velocity were performed with a Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) and were compared with 3D RANS turbulence models’ simulation results. A reasonable agreement was found between experimental and simulation results concerning the velocity and the turbulence kinetic energy with CFD models slightly underestimating these magnitudes. The k-ε series turbulence models and especially the standard k-ε, RNG k-ε and Realizable k-ε models presented good agreement concerning velocity contours; however, high prediction error occurred over the roof of the buildings compared to the average values."

This comparison gave a satisfactory agreement with the analytical model. The airflow model is presented as flow-pressure equation and can be integrated easily in vapour intrusion models or ventilation models to enable the quantification of the impact of these pollutants on indoor air quality."

abstract,"Abstract The present paper focuses on the development steps of heat exchangers dedicated to single room ventilation unit with heat recovery (SRVHR) by proposing a numerical approach. A methodology is suggested in order to determine the best trade-off between hydraulic and thermal performance given a specific geometry. The methodology consists in a mapping of the coefficient of performance (COP) of the unit. The latter is defined as the ratio between recovered heat and the fan energy use, given a specific indoor/outdoor temperature difference. However, the energy performance should not be the only criterion to be taken into account in the frame of the design steps of a heat recovery exchanger: technical, economic and acoustic aspects should also be considered. This numerical methodology is illustrated by means of a real example of a newly developed heat exchanger dedicated to a SRVHR. The optimization is first performed while using a semi-empirical model (based on the use of correlations and on a spatial division of the studied heat exchanger). The semi-empirical model allows for the creation of a COP map in order to identify the most effective geometry parameters for the heat exchanger. The decision concerning the final geometry is made accounting for the so-called technical, economic and acoustic considerations. A discussion on some parameters needed for the COP establishment is also proposed."

abstract,"Abstract Occupant behavior (OB) in buildings is a leading factor influencing energy use in buildings. Quantifying this influence requires the integration of OB models with building performance simulation (BPS). This study reviews approaches to representing and implementing OB models in today’s popular BPS programs, and discusses weaknesses and strengths of these approaches and key issues in integrating of OB models with BPS programs. Two key findings are: (1) a common data model is needed to standardize the representation of OB models, enabling their flexibility and exchange among BPS programs and user applications; the data model can be implemented using a standard syntax (e.g., in the form of XML schema), and (2) a modular software implementation of OB models, such as functional mock-up units for co-simulation, adopting the common data model, has advantages in providing a robust and interoperable integration with multiple BPS programs. Such common OB model representation and implementation approaches help standardize the input structures of OB models, enable collaborative development of a shared library of OB models, and allow for rapid and widespread integration of OB models with BPS programs to improve the simulation of occupant behavior and quantification of their impact on building performance."

abstract,"Abstract There have been a number of attempts in the past to define “near extreme” weather for facilitating overheating analysis in free running buildings. The most recently efforts include CIBSE latest release of Design Summer Year (DSY) weather using multiple complete weather years and a newly proposed composite DSY. This research aims to assess how various single zone offices respond to these new definitions of near extreme weathers. Parametric studies were carried out on single zone offices through which four sampling sets of models were employed to examine the thermal responses of dry bulb temperature, global solar radiation & wind speed collectively. London weather data from 1976 to 1995 were used and the overheating assessments were made based on CIBSE Guide A & BS EN 15251. The research discovers that solar radiation and wind both influence the predicted indoor warmth with solar radiation has obvious stronger impacts than wind. No perfect correlation was found from observation and Spearman’s rank order analysis on the ranks between the weather warmth and the predicted indoor warmth. The ranks made using multiple weather parameters show better correlation than some of the dry bulb temperature only metrics. The research also discovers that the Test Reference Year weather behaves warmer than expected. It is also found that a single complete year can not represent the near-extreme consistently and there is no evidence a composite DSY is better statistically. These findings support the notion of using multiple complete warm weather years for overheating assessments."

abstract,"Abstract When a chemical or biological agent is suddenly released into a ventilation system, its dispersion needs to be promptly and accurately detected. In this work, an optimization method for sensors layout in air ductwork was presented. Three optimal objectives were defined, i.e. the minimum detection time, minimum contaminant exposure, and minimum probability of undetected pollution events. Genetic algorithm (GA) method was used to obtain the non-dominated solutions of multiobjectives optimization problem and the global optimal solution was selected among all of the non-dominated solutions by ordering solutions method. Since the biochemical attack occurred in a ventilation system was a random process, two releasing scenarios were proposed, i.e. the uniform and the air volume-based probability distribution. It was found that such a probability distribution affected the results of optimal sensors layout and also resulted in different detect time and different probability of undetected events. It was discussed how the objective functions are being compatible and competitive with each other, and how sensor quantity affect the optimal results and computational load. The impact of changes on other parameters was given, i.e. the deposition coefficient, the air volume distribution and the manual releasing. This work presents an angle of air ductwork design for indoor environment protection and expects to help in realizing the optimized sensor system design for sudden contaminant releasing within ventilation systems."

abstract,"Abstract Suitable air distributions are essential for creating thermally comfortable and healthy conditions in indoor spaces. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is widely used to predict air distributions. This study systematically assessed the performance of the two most popular CFD programs, STAR-CCM+ and ANSYS Fluent, in predicting air distributions. The assessment used the same meshes and thermo-fluid boundary conditions for several types of airflow found in indoor spaces, and experimental data from the literature. The programs were compared in terms of grid-independent solutions; turbulent viscosity calculations; heat transfer coefficients as determined by wall functions; and complex flow with complicated boundary conditions. The two programs produced almost the same results with similar computing effort, although ANSYS Fluent seemed slightly better in some aspects."

abstract,"Abstract Since the 21st century, problems such as global warming and energy depletion have become important issues to scientists and architects. The architectural design nowadays often relies on large amount of mechanical equipment to create a comfortable environment for the users. However, it burdens and deteriorates the nature. On the other hand, some of the traditional architecture in the past can cope with the local humid and hot climate, achieving good passive heat control for the environment. Therefore, this study explores the relation between traditional residents in Taiwan’s use of space and the external environment and climate through modern environment measurement technique, restores and conducts quantitative analysis on the interior thermal environment and light environment of Lin-An-Tai Historical House in the past through Ecotect Analysis, and analyzes the results of the calculation in terms of its spatial allocation, openings, and outer walls, etc. This study also evaluates the effects of lighting and user’s sense of comfortable temperature under its environmental conditions according to the standards of residential quality nowadays. It further studies the ancestor of traditional architecture by reviewing its spatial order and compares to the current situation in order to feedback the modern architecture design. Part of the results of the simulation show that the variation of temperature indoors in each space is less dynamic than that of outdoors. The temperature in the space at the right of the main hall (northwestern side) is generally higher than that in the left (southeastern side). The highest temperature in the space farther away from the interior patio is usually higher than that in the space closer to the interior patio. The temperature near the outer side of the space above Hulong is higher than that in the middle. Accordingly, the location is closely related to the interior temperature. As to human’s sense of comfortable temperature, the results show that in summer, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) in the space at the left of the main hall (southeastern side) is generally higher than that in the right (northwestern side). In winter, the sense of comfortable temperature in the rooms in the corner is lower than that in other rooms at the inner side, the comparison between the space ethical order and the evaluation result did not show any obvious relationship. For the evaluation of lighting, the main hall and the restaurant at the outer left Hulong have better lighting while other space does not have sufficient and even lighting. Artificial lighting is needed to make the space more functional, the results shows that lighting conditions of space did not metaphor to the space ethical order."

abstract,"Abstract This study develops a ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) simulation model for a residential code-compliant simulation tool. To achieve this, this study proposed the g-function approximation method using polynomial curve-fitting equations. In addition, the residential air-source heat pump (ASHP) simulation model (i.e., RESYS in DOE-2.1e) was modified to include a vertical ground heat exchanger module. To check validity of the new GCHP system model, this study compared the simulation results against the results from the other simulation tools. The results between the programs showed good agreement within 5.3% differences for the annual total site energy use. Using the developed GCHP simulation model, the energy savings for a code-compliant residential building in Houston and Dallas were evaluated in comparison with the ASHP system, and the resultant annual energy savings were about 10% to 15% in the total site energy use and 30% to 40% in the heating plus cooling energy use."

abstract,"Abstract Identifying possible airborne transmission routes and assessing the associated infectious risks are essential for implementing effective control measures. This study focuses on the infiltration-induced inter-unit pollutant dispersion in a high-rise residential (HRR) building. The outdoor wind pressure distribution on the building facades was obtained from the wind tunnel experiments. And the inter-household infiltration and tracer gas transmission were simulated using multi-zone model. The risk levels along building height and under different wind directions were examined, and influence of component leakage area was analysed. It is found that, the cross-infection risk can be over 20% because of the low air infiltration rate below 0.7 ACH, which is significantly higher than the risk of 9% obtained in our previous on-site measurement with air change rate over 3 ACH. As the air infiltration rate increases along building height, cross-infection risk is generally higher on the lower floors. The effect of wind direction on inter-unit dispersion level is significant, and the presence of a contaminant source in the windward side results in the highest cross-infection risks in other adjacent units on the same floor. Properly improving internal components tightness and increasing air change via external components are beneficial to the control of internal inter-unit transmission induced by infiltration. However, this approach may increase the cross-infection via the external transmission, and effective control measures should be further explored considering multiple transmission routes."

abstract,"Abstract The analysis of innovative designs that distributes control to buildings over a network is currently a challenging task as exciting building performance simulation tools do not offer sufficient capabilities and the flexibility to fully respond to the full complexity of Automated Buildings (ABs). For that reason, this paper deals with the design and development of a middleware for distributed control and building performance simulations that has been carried out to study and analyze the impact of control systems on building performance applications (i.e., building indoor environments) over a network, rather than costly and time-consuming experiments. The paper also presents a model-based Systems Engineering (SE) methodology for development and design of distributed control and building performance simulations involving two or more different software tools over a network. The main objective of this framework is to run-time couple one or multiple building performance simulation tool(s) with a control modelling environment over a network in order to similarly represent Building Automation and Control Systems (BACS) architecture in a simulation."

abstract,"Abstract Cooling load prediction is indispensable to many building energy saving strategies. In this paper, we proposed a new method for predicting the cooling load of commercial buildings. The proposed approach employs a Bayesian Network model to relate the cooling load to outdoor weather conditions and internal building activities. The proposed method is computationally efficient and implementable for use in real buildings, as it does not involve sophisticated mathematical theories. In this paper, we described the proposed method and demonstrated its use via a case study. In this case study, we considered three candidate models for cooling load prediction and they are the proposed Bayesian Network model, a Support Vector Machine model, and an Artificial Neural Network model. We trained the three models with fourteen different training data datasets, each of which had varying amounts and quality of data that were sampled on-site. The prediction results for a testing week shows that the Bayesian Network model achieves similar accuracy as the Support Vector Machine model but better accuracy than the Artificial Neural Network model. Notable in this comparison is that the training process of the Bayesian Network model is fifty-eight times faster than that of the Artificial Neural Network model. The results also suggest that all three models will have much larger prediction deviations if the testing data points are not covered by the training dataset for the studied case (The maximum absolute deviation of the predictions that are not covered by the training dataset can be up to seven times larger than that of the predictions covered by the training dataset). In addition, we also found the uncertainties in the weather forecast significantly affected the accuracy of the cooling load prediction for the studied case and the Support Vector Machine model was more sensitive to those uncertainties than the other two models."

abstract,"Abstract Roof greening is a new technique for improvement of outdoor thermal environment which influences air quality through its impacts on thermal and flow field. In order to examine effects of green roofs on reactive pollutant dispersion within urban street canyons, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was employed which contained NO-NO2-O3 photochemistry and energy balance models. Simulations were performed for street canyons with different aspect ratios (H/W) of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 such that leaf area density (LAD) of green roofs changed. It was found that roof greening led distribution of pollutants to alter for H/W = 0.5 and 1.0 cases in such a manner that their averaged concentrations had small variations as LAD changed. However, by increasing LAD in H/W = 2.0, ventilation efficiency of nitrogen oxides increased since the flow was enhanced within the canyon. Additionally, averaged concentration of ozone in H/W = 2.0 increased with increasing LAD, owing to downward flux of ozone at roof level. Results  show that roof greening is a good strategy which can be used in order to improve air quality and thermal environment, especially within deep street canyons."

abstract,"Abstract Occupancy has significant impacts on building performance. However, in current building performance simulation programs, occupancy inputs are static and lack diversity, contributing to discrepancies between the simulated and actual building performance. This paper presents an Occupancy Simulator that simulates the stochastic behavior of occupant presence and movement in buildings, capturing the spatial and temporal occupancy diversity. Each occupant and each space in the building are explicitly simulated as an agent with their profiles of stochastic behaviors. The occupancy behaviors are represented with three types of models: (1) the status transition events (e.g., first arrival in office) simulated with probability distribution model, (2) the random moving events (e.g., from one office to another) simulated with a homogeneous Markov chain model, and (3) the meeting events simulated with a new stochastic model. A hierarchical data model was developed for the Occupancy Simulator, which reduces the amount of data input by using the concepts of occupant types and space types. Finally, a case study of a small office building is presented to demonstrate the use of the Simulator to generate detailed annual sub-hourly occupant schedules for individual spaces and the whole building. The Simulator is a web application freely available to the public and capable of performing a detailed stochastic simulation of occupant presence and movement in buildings. Future work includes enhancements in the meeting event model, consideration of personal absent days, verification and validation of the simulated occupancy results, and expansion for use with residential buildings."

abstract,"Abstract Natural ventilation strategies as effective low energy refurbishment solutions are identified within this research study, for an existing urban multi-storey apartment building in Athens, representative of over four-million Greek urban residential buildings. Retrofit strategies were evaluated using occupant comfort criteria and the existing ventilation strategy, for a single apartment using dynamic thermal simulations. These strategies included individual day and night ventilation, a wind-catcher and a dynamic façade. Suitable openings operation in response to environmental parameters provided sufficient day and night ventilation and occupant comfort. The inclusion of a wind-catcher yielded very little improvement to the ventilation performance. However, the combined operation of the wind-catcher and the dynamic façade delivered operative temperature reductions of up to 7 °C below the base-case strategy, and acceptable ventilation rates for up to 65% of the cooling period. The successful performance of the proposed strategies highlights their potential for reducing energy consumption and improving thermal comfort in a large number of buildings in hot climates."

abstract,"Abstract Many data-driven algorithms are being explored in the field of building energy performance estimation. Choosing an appropriate method for a specific case is critical to guarantee a successful energy operation management such as measurement and verification. Currently, little research work on assessment of different data-driven algorithms using real time measurement data sets is available. In this paper, five commonly used data-driven algorithms, ARX, SS, N4S, discretized variable BN and continuous variable BN, are used to estimate HVAC related electricity energy consumption in a university dormitory. In practice, total energy consumption data is easily accessible, while separated HVAC energy consumption data is not commonly available due to expensive sub-metering and/or the complexity of mechanical and electrical layouts. A virtual sub-meter based on a decomposition method is proposed to separate HVAC energy consumption from the total building energy consumption, which is derived from an improved Fourier series based decomposition method."

abstract,"Abstract The EnovHeat project aims at developing an innovative heat pump system based on the magnetocaloric effect and active magnetic regenerator technology to provide for the heating needs of a single family house in Denmark. Unlike vapor-compression devices, magnetocaloric heat pumps use the reversible magnetocaloric effect of a solid refrigerant to build a cooling/heating cycle. It has the potential for high coefficient of performance, more silent operation and efficient part-load control. After presenting the operation principles of the magnetocaloric device and the different models used in the current numerical study, this article demonstrates for the first time the possibility to utilize this novel heat pump in a building. This device can be integrated in a single hydronic loop including a ground source heat exchanger and a radiant under-floor heating system. At maximum capacity, this magnetocaloric heat pump can deliver 2600 W of heating power with an appreciable average seasonal system COP of 3.93. On variable part-load operation with a simple fluid flow controller, it can heat up an entire house with an average seasonal system COP of 1.84."

abstract,"Abstract Exterior greenery systems such as green walls and green roof can provide energy saving and environmental benefits. Several previous studies examined thermal impacts of green roof/walls on a test envelope or simplified buildings in local climates. However, few studies examined the effects of exterior greenery systems considering building types, air conditioning operating conditions, and wall orientations in varied climates. The objective of this study is to investigate cooling energy savings associated with exterior greenery systems for the US Department of Energy (DOE) standard reference buildings, depending on building type, wall orientation, and local climate. Hourly energy consumption was examined for three types of reference buildings: (1) medium office, (2) hospital, and (3) primary school. For the three reference buildings, hourly solar radiation and latent heat transfer rates were calculated for four representative local climates (i.e., hot-dry, hot-humid, cold-humid, and warm-dry). Results  show that latent heat transfer due to plant transpiration can dominate heat transfer through the exterior greenery systems. Among the four climates studied herein, heat removal due to evaporation by green walls and roof over the summer months (June to August) is the largest (up to 680 kWh/m2) in Phoenix, while it is in similar range (300–350 kWh/m2) for green walls and roof in other cities. Building type also has notable impacts on the energy performance of the exterior greenery system. Primary school achieves the most significant cooling energy saving in all climates because of high envelope heat gains compared to medium office and hospital. For the primary school in Phoenix, annual cooling energy saving can be maximized up to 27,000 kWh/y with green walls and up to 69,000 kWh/y with a green roof. Latent heat transfer due to evaporation is similar (< 6%) between south and west green walls, implying that utilizing a west green wall could be a good alternative or complement to using a south green wall for cooling energy saving."

abstract,"Abstract Coupled and distributed simulation helps in understanding the complexity arising from the combined effects of interdependent systems, by connecting and exchanging information across several software programs. In the building energy analysis domain, several tools have been created in the past to facilitate such analyses. However, the existing coupling frameworks such as Building Control Virtual Test Bed (BCVTB), MLE+, High-Level Architecture (HLA), and Functional Mockup Unit are characterized by their inherent complexity, making it a challenge for the building practitioners to widely deploy them in everyday decision-making. In addition, several of these frameworks embody tight coupling, which means they lack the flexibility to incorporate models and components of decision-makers’ choice. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Lightweight and Adaptive Building Simulation (LABS) framework that capitalizes on Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM), an inter-process communication framework widely used by the robotics community. As a case study demonstrating this new framework, a building energy simulation model is coupled with an agent-based occupant behavior model to understand the energy effects of occupants’ thermal comfort related actions (e.g., adjusting the thermostat set point). These behavioral patterns are also influenced by various interventions (e.g., peer pressure, energy-based education) that may occur in the building. Measuring these effects in a real building for a lengthy period is impractical and resource-intensive and the LABS framework can be used for understanding this system better. The results also highlight opportunities for achieving energy savings by influencing the occupants’ comfort related behavior."

abstract,"Abstract A poor depiction of occupant behavior in building performance simulation frequently results in substantial divergences between real and simulated results. The problem may be of particular concern with simulation supporting the renovation of older multi-unit residential buildings, buildings whose occupants use windows for temperature control even during heating season. Here, we investigated the impact of window operation models (as well as other occupant behaviors) on simulated energy performance in university residence halls. Based on environmental monitoring, along with information collected from occupant surveys and wearable devices, we estimated air exchange rates and developed a probabilistic window-operation prediction model. The data were collected in 76 dormitory rooms sampled from a pre-renovated historic building and two similar buildings. We then evaluated the window-operation model’s predictive performance in 15 dormitory rooms in the post-renovated building with new occupants. The results of our predictive model were also compared with previously reported window-operation models. We implemented each window-operation model in a calibrated EnergyPlus building performance model, comparing the results of each simulation to metered hourly steam consumption. The impact of the different window operation models on simulated heating energy use was significant (annual error ranging from 0.2% to 10%). Our model demonstrated the highest capability of predicting window state (accuracy=85.8%) and steam use (NMBE=−0.2%); however, some previously published windowoperation models also produced satisfactory performance, implying that such models may be generalizable to some extent. The results suggest that data collected from somewhat ubiquitous indoor environmental quality sensors can glean insights into occupant behavior for building performance simulation. Furthermore, the energy impacts resulting from the variations in occupant behavior studied here were large enough to show that the choice of behavior model can have meaningful implications for real-world applications, such as estimating saving from heating and lighting system upgrades."

abstract,"Abstract As building owners, designers, and operators aim to achieve significant reductions in overall energy consumption, understanding and evaluating the probable impacts of occupant behavior becomes a critical component of a holistic energy conservation strategy. This becomes significantly more pronounced in ultra-efficient buildings, where system loads such as heating, cooling, lighting, and ventilation are reduced or eliminated through high-performance building design and where occupant behavior-driven impacts reflect a large portion of end-use energy. Further, variation in behavior patterns can substantially impact the persistence of any performance gains. This paper describes a methodology of building occupant behavior modeling using simulation methods developed by the Building Energy Research Center (BERC) at Tsinghua University using measured energy consumption data collected by the University of Washington Integrated Design Lab (UW IDL). The Bullitt Center, a six-story 4831 m2 (52,000 ft2) net-positive-energy urban office building in Seattle, WA, USA, is one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world (2013 WAN Sustainable Building of the Year Winner). Its measured energy consumption in 2015 was approximately 34.8 kWh/(m2∙yr) (11 kBtu/(ft2∙yr)). Occupant behavior exerts an out-sized influence on the energy performance of the building. Nearly 33% of the end-use energy consumption at the Bullitt Center consists of unregulated miscellaneous electrical loads (plug-loads), which are directly attributable to occupant behavior and equipment procurement choices. Approximately 16% of end-use energy is attributable to electric lighting which is also largely determined by occupant behavior. Key to the building’s energy efficiency is employment of lighting controls and daylighting strategies to minimize the lighting load. This paper uses measured energy use in a 330 m2 (3550 ft2) open office space in this building to inform occupant profiles that are then modified to create four scenarios to model the impact of behavior on lighting use. By using measured energy consumption and an energy model to simulate the energy performance of this space, this paper evaluates the potential energy savings based on different occupant behavior. This paper describes occupant behavior simulation methods and evaluates them using a robust dataset of 15 minute interval sub-metered energy consumption data. Lighting control strategies are compared via simulation results, in order to achieve the best match between occupant schedules, controls, and energy savings. Using these findings, we propose a simulation methodology that incorporates measured energy use data to generate occupant schedules and control schemes with the ultimate aim of using simulation results to evaluate energy saving measures that target occupant behavior."

abstract,"Abstract The objective of obtaining high performance energy buildings can be reached considering the contemporaneous effects of technical characteristics and occupancy. Recent studies report that as buildings become more energy efficient, the behavior of occupants plays an increasing role in consumption. Therefore, a construction designed to be a Nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) might generate higher consumption than expected if the assumptions made in the simulation process are not respected during the real use. The occupant can modify the control strategies of internal variables (heating/cooling system operation, set point temperature, ventilation, lighting) and the users’ behavior has a high impact on the utilization of plants and equipment. A significant contribution is also represented by the internal gains that have a direct relation with occupancy. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of housing occupancy patterns on the definition of residential nZEB in Italian climatic conditions. The investigation has been carried out considering a case study consisting of a building designed according to the National Standards. Successively, different conditions of the building usage are analyzed using dynamic energy simulations that allow exploration of the different occupation modes. The variability of the family composition and the occupancy scenarios are defined based on the data collected in the specific context. The investigation provides information regarding the effects of human variables (occupants’ needs and preferences) on the final energy performance of low energy buildings and highlights the combination of variables that are important in the definition of nZEB as net zero source energy."

abstract,"Abstract In building performance simulation, occupant behavior contributes to large uncertainties, which often lead to considerable discrepancies between actual energy consumption and simulation results. This paper aims to extract occupant-behavior related electricity load patterns using classical K-means clustering approach at the initial investigation stage. Smart-metering data from a case study in Shanghai, China, was used for the load pattern analysis. The electricity load patterns of occupants were examined on a daily/weekly/seasonal basis. According to their load patterns, occupants were categorized as (a) white-collar workers, (b) poor or older families and (c) rich or young families. The daily patterns indicated that electricity use was much more random and fluctuated over a wide range. Most households of the monitored communities consumed relatively-low electricity; the characteristic double peak with higher level of consumption in the morning and evening were only apparent in a relatively small subset of residents (mostly white-collar workers). The weekly analysis found that significant load shifting towards weekend days occurred in the poor or old family group. The electricity saving potential was greatest in the white-collar workers and the rich or young family groups. This study concludes with recommendations to stakeholders utilizing our load profiling results. The research provides a rare insight into the electricity-use-related occupant behaviors of Shanghai residents through the case study of two communities. The findings of the study are also presented in a meaningful way so that they can directly aid the decision-making of governments and other stakeholders interested in energy efficiency. The research results are also relevant to the building energy simulation community as they are derived from observations, and thus can have the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulation results."

abstract,"Abstract Space heating is the highest energy consumer in the operation of residential facilities in cold regions. Energy saving measures for efficient space heating operation are thus of paramount importance in efforts to reduce energy consumption in buildings. For effective functioning of space heating systems, efficient facility management coupled with relevant occupant behaviour information is necessary. However, current practice in space heating control is event-driven rather than user-centric, and in most cases relevant occupant information is not incorporated into space heating energy management strategies. This causes system inefficiency during the occupancy phase. For multi-family residential facilities, integrating occupant information within space heating energy management strategies poses several challenges; unlike with commercial facilities, in multi-family facilities occupant behavior does not follow any fixed activity-schedule pattern. In this study, a framework is developed for extracting relevant information about the uncertainties pertaining to occupant patterns (i.e., demand load) in multi-family residential facilities by identifying the factors affecting space heating energy consumption. This is achieved using sensor-based data monitoring during the occupancy phase. Based on the analysis of the monitoring data, a structure is defined for developing an occupant pattern prediction model that can be integrated with energy management strategies to reduce energy usage in multi-family residential facilities. To demonstrate the developed framework, a multi-family residential building in Fort McMurray, Canada, is chosen as a case study. This paper shows that integrating the developed occupant pattern prediction model within space heating energy management strategies can assist facility managers to achieve space heating energy savings in multi-family residential facilities."

abstract,"Abstract In current building performance simulation programs, occupant presence and interactions with building systems are over-simplified and less indicative of real world scenarios, contributing to the discrepancies between simulated and actual energy use in buildings. Simulation results are normally presented using various types of charts. However, using those charts, it is difficult to visualize and communicate the importance of occupants’ behavior to building energy performance. This study introduced a new approach to simulating and visualizing energy-related occupant behavior in office buildings. First, the Occupancy Simulator was used to simulate the occupant presence and movement and generate occupant schedules for each space as well as for each occupant. Then an occupant behavior functional mockup unit (obFMU) was used to model occupant behavior and analyze their impact on building energy use through co-simulation with EnergyPlus. Finally, an agent-based model built upon AnyLogic was applied to visualize the simulation results of the occupant movement and interactions with building systems, as well as the related energy performance. A case study using a small office building in Miami, FL was presented to demonstrate the process and application of the Occupancy Simulator, the obFMU and EnergyPlus, and the AnyLogic module in simulation and visualization of energy-related occupant behaviors in office buildings. The presented approach provides a new detailed and visual way for policy makers, architects, engineers and building operators to better understand occupant energy behavior and their impact on energy use in buildings, which can improve the design and operation of low energy buildings."

abstract,"Abstract This research aims at demonstrating that wayfinding solutions can improve the effectiveness of the evacuation processes in complex architectural spaces such as those of cruise ships. We investigated the behaviours of passengers in maritime disaster to figure out whether people act similarly during buildings egress and ships evacuation. Data were collected through questionnaires administered in 2015 to passengers boarding various cruise ships at the port of Ancona (Italy), and through the analysis of real footage of the evacuation of the Costa Concordia. The open source software Fire Dynamics Simulator with Evacuation (FDS+EVAC), used in building egress analyses, was adapted to include these behavioural and event information such as familiarity with ship layout, ship rotation and lifeboats boarding. Simulation results on the case study confirmed similarities between ships and buildings evacuations, underlining the effectiveness of wayfinding solutions to improve passengers’ evacuation flows and routes selection. This study also demonstrated that computer simulation could benefit the ship design process, the preparation of safety guidelines, and the crewmembers during naval emergency management training."

abstract,"Abstract As regional drought conditions continue deteriorating around the world, residential water use has been brought into the built environment spotlight. Nevertheless, the understanding of water use behavior in residential buildings is still limited. This paper presents data analytics and results from monitoring data of daily water use (DWU) in 50 single-family homes in Texas, USA. The results show the typical frequency distribution curve of the DWU per household and indicate personal income, education level and energy use of appliances all have statistically significant effects on the DWU per capita. Analysis of the water-intensive use demonstrates the residents tend to use more water in post-vacation days. These results help generate awareness of water use behavior in homes. Ultimately, this research could support policy makers to establish a water use baseline and inform water conservation programs."

abstract,"Abstract The following article illuminates existing challenges and restrictions when implementing available stochastic user behavior models in building performance simulation (BPS). 24 occupancy behavior models from the literature containing a clear mathematical description are attempted to be coupled with a BPS model in a case study. Different methods, amongst others co-simulation approaches benefitting from the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard, were investigated to realize the implementation. The majority of OB models were coupled successfully with the BPS; however, some were not. The reason for the failed coupling is rather based on the restriction of OB models for BPS use than the coupling methods. Generally, OB models are based on stochastic modeling, while BPS requires a clear decision, a trigger for further interaction. Some OB models do not provide an output in such a binary form. Therefore, it is difficult to use these models in BPS without any assumption from the modeler. Furthermore, the majority of OB models lead to a state change depending on a comparison between its computed probability and a random number, which conflicts with the reproducibility of BPS results. In addition, some OB models result in an improper behavior without a reversal function or hysteresis. Based on the case study, these issues and requirements for OB models for the use in BPS as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various coupling approaches with BPS are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract The correct simulation of energy needs for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning of the rooms of a museum is strictly correlated to the estimation of internal loads deriving from the presence of visitors, who are responsible for both sensible and latent gains. However, visitors’ profiles on short time scales (e.g., 15 minutes) in museum rooms are often not available data. In this work, we present a correlation between the statistical distribution of visitors’ presence in the main exhibition rooms of a museum and the profile of sold tickets, which is usually readily accessible. We apply the procedure to a real museum, using the results of a monitoring campaign for the best-fitting of the correlation curves and for the validation of the model. The fitting curves are the superposition of three Gaussian distributions, where daily and weekly peaks are taken into account. Each distribution refers to a period of the day (late morning/early afternoon, afternoon, and late afternoon), and has a standard deviation obtained by a best-fit procedure, and an integral corresponding to the sum of the sold tickets in its specific period of the day. The model is validated comparing monitored data of temperature and specific humidity in the rooms with the results of a dynamic simulation, run on TRNSYS 17, using the modeled correlation. By means of this validated model, energy-saving measures on the examined museum can be reliably simulated. At the same time, it is reasonable to assume that the same method could be applicable to other buildings with similar occupancy (e.g., galleries, exhibitions)."

abstract,"Abstract Model predictive control is a promising approach to optimize the operation of building systems and provide demand-response functionalities without compromising indoor comfort. The performance of model predictive control relies, among other things, on the quality of weather forecasts and building occupancy predictions. The present study compares the accuracy and computational demand of two occupancy estimation and prediction approaches suitable for building model predictive control: (1) count prediction based on indoor climate modeling and parameter estimation “using common sensors”, (2) count prediction based on data from 3D stereovision camera. The performance of the two approaches was tested in two rooms of a case study building. The results show that the method with dedicated sensors outperforms common sensors. However, if a building is not equipped with dedicated sensors, the present study shows that the common sensor method can be a satisfactory alternative to be used in model predictive control."

abstract,"Abstract Currently, energy performance indicators for buildings are associated with the primary energy source consumption, CO2 emissions or net energy distribution, which together set the building’s energy efficiency. The evaluation is frequently based on setpoint temperatures and hours of operation. However, these fixed parameters are not suitable for social housing simulation as their performance tends to be in free running, excluding extremely cold or warm conditions. Therefore, a more successful assessment for the efficiency of these buildings is the users’ capability to live within adaptive comfort ranges without air conditioning systems. The aim of this research is to analyze new Chilean standards for sustainable social housing in the context of climate change using the adaptive comfort approach addressed in EN 15251:2007. Using EnergyPlus simulation software, 16 parametric series are analyzed for current conditions and validated against on-site measurements. Meanwhile, a prediction for the climate in 2050 has also been taken into account. The case study is the most widespread low cost dwelling model. The study demonstrates that the period of time within thermal comfort conditions varies substantially if analysis is done using the adaptive comfort standard or the Sustainable Construction Code (CCS) for Chilean housing. Considering climate change, the percentage of time fluctuates from −19.00% to 24.30%. Concluding that the adaptive comfort model has a greater capacity to positively assess indoor temperatures for social housing in Central-Southern Chile. This research also establishes that it is possible to provide homes where standards are improved within comfort conditions without using artificial means, 99.67% of the time currently and 88.89% in the future."

abstract,"Abstract To achieve computational efficiency, efforts toward developing urban-scale energy modeling applications frequently rely on various domain simplifications. For instance, heat transfer phenomena are captured using reduced order models. As a consequence, specific aspects pertaining to the temporal dynamics of energy load patterns and their dependency on transient phenomena (e.g., weather conditions, inhabitants’ presence and actions) cannot be realistically represented. To address this circumstance, we have conceived, implemented, and documented a two-step urban energy modeling approach that combines cluster analysis and sampling techniques, full dynamic numeric simulation capability, and stochastic methods. The paper describes the suggested urban energy modeling approach and the embedded cluster analysis supported sampling methodology. More particularly we focus on the aspects of this approach that explicitly involve the representation of inhabitants in urban-scale energy modeling. In this regard, the potential to recover lost dynamic diversity (e.g., in computation of temporal load patterns) due to the deployed reductive sampling is explored. Parametric runs based on stochastic variations of underlying building use profiles facilitate the generation of highly realistic load patterns despite the small number of buildings selected to represent the simulation domain. We illustrate the utility of the proposed urban energy modeling approach to address queries concerning the energy efficiency potential of behaviorally effective instruments. The feasibility of the envisioned scenarios concerning inhabitants and their behavior (high-resolution temporal load prediction, assessment of behavioral variation) is presented in detail via specific instances of district-level energy modeling for the city of Vienna, Austria."

abstract,"Abstract Load shedding enjoys increasing popularity as a way to reduce power consumption in buildings during hours of peak demand on the electricity grid. This practice has well known cost saving and reliability benefits for the grid, and the contracts utilities sign with their “interruptible” customers often pass on substantial electricity cost savings to participants. Less well-studied are the impacts of load shedding on building occupants, hence this study investigates those impacts on occupant comfort and adaptive behaviors. It documents experience in two office buildings located near Philadelphia (USA) that vary in terms of controllability and the set of adaptive actions available to occupants. An agent-based model (ABM) framework generalizes the case-study insights in a “what-if” format to support operational decision making by building managers and tenants. The framework, implemented in EnergyPlus and NetLogo, simulates occupants that have heterogeneous thermal and lighting preferences. The simulated occupants pursue local adaptive actions such as adjusting clothing or using portable fans when central building controls are not responsive, and experience organizational constraints, including a corporate dress code and miscommunication with building managers. The model predicts occupant decisions to act fairly well but has limited ability to predict which specific adaptive actions occupants will select."

abstract,"Abstract Building-to-grid integration is one important step in having a smart grid. This integration will support energy efficiency, load balancing, and the incorporation of renewables. This study introduces a residential building energy management solution to control connected devices based on economic signals from the grid and occupant behavior. An air-conditioning unit, a water heater, and an electric vehicle (EV) were modeled and controlled using a traditional on/off controller and model predictive controller (MPC). The MPC is designed to minimize the total building electricity costs while maintaining occupant comfort. The MPC utilizes the building thermal mass, the EV battery storage, and the water heater’s hot water tank to shift electricity use to a period when the price is lower. This controller considers occupant behavior as a constraint in controlling these devices to maintain users’ comfort. The simulation results show a 10%–30% reduction in the electricity bill by applying the MPC in a dynamic electricity price scenario, as compared to the traditional methods of control. The proposed method of control makes buildings responsive to grid signals that provide the potential of peak shaving and ancillary services."

abstract,"Abstract Smart building management and control are adopted nowadays to achieve zero-net energy use in buildings. However, without considering the human dimension, technologies alone do not necessarily guarantee high performance in buildings. An office building was designed and built according to state-of-the-art design and energy management principles in 2008. Despite the expectations of high performance, the owner was facing high utility bills and low user comfort in the building located in Budapest, Hungary. The objective of the project was to evaluate the energy performance and comfort indices of the building, to identify the causes of malfunction and to elaborate a comprehensive energy concept. Firstly, current building conditions and operation parameters were evaluated. Our investigation found that the state-of-the-art building management system was in good conditions but it was operated by building operators and occupants who are not aware of the building management practice. The energy consumption patterns of the building were simulated with energy modelling software. The baseline model was calibrated to annual measured energy consumption, using actual occupant behaviour and presence, based on results of self-reported surveys, occupancy sensors and fan-coil usage data. Realistic occupant behaviour models can capture diversity of occupant behaviour and better represent the real energy use of the building. This way our findings and the effect of our proposed improvements could be more reliable. As part of our final comprehensive energy concept, we proposed intervention measures that would increase indoor thermal comfort and decrease energy consumption of the building. A parametric study was carried out to evaluate and quantify energy, comfort and return on investment of each measure. It was found that in the best case the building could save 23% of annual energy use. Future work includes the follow-up of: occupant reactions to intervention measures, the realized energy savings, the measurement of occupant satisfaction and behavioural changes."

abstract,"Abstract In order to dissipate sound which passes through an open awning window, we have developed a hybrid absorber made of a modified Helmholtz resonator with perforated foam. Generally, acoustic absorbers are divided into two major categories. The first one is porous materials which dissipate the acoustic wave in a visco-inertial form and heat. The second category is systems which absorb the energy of the acoustic wave by resonance. The aim of this work was to design a hybrid absorber which incorporates the benefits of the two categories for both high frequencies (conventional foam) and low frequencies (resonator). After describing the concept and the principles, we present the prototype which was built and tested under laboratory conditions between two reverberant rooms to attenuate the sound when an awning window is open. The prototype allows reduction of noise transmission (up to 6 dB) at low and high frequencies."

abstract,"Abstract Choosing the right control strategies is an important task for effective operation of variable air volume reheat (VAVR) system in commercial buildings. In this design, dampers’ position inside air terminal units (ATUs) are modulated to adjust the amount of air supply volume based on thermal zones’ cooling or heating demand. A minimum air flow fraction (MAFF) is set for damper settings of ATUs to avoid under-ventilation problem in thermal zones. This study investigated the impact of MAFF value on various performance aspects of multiple-zone VAVR design in different building applications and climate types. A five-storey commercial building for three applications of school, office and retail in four climate types of tropical monsoon, hot desert, Mediterranean and humid continental have been simulated in EnergyPlus building simulation software. The results of simulations have shown that lowering MAFF value in ATUs would reduce the required reheat coil energy to maintain precise air supply temperature at part load cooling scenarios. Nonetheless, this reduction could have some implications on thermal comfort and indoor air quality level of thermal zones in a multiple-zone arrangement. It was concluded that in general it is an energy efficient control strategy to keep MAFF value to as low as 0.1 for high ventilation rate spaces like classrooms in school buildings (except for hot desert climate). On the other hand, it is advisable to not reduce MAFF value below 0.3 for low ventilation rate spaces like office areas to avoid any air quality issues in thermal zones."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents an assessment of the efficiency of the fenestration system in a courtyard house in hot climate. The empirical work draws better understanding of the wind behavior inside and outside the building and the manner of both the wind-driven and stack ventilation through conducting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Numerous steady state simulations were applied for different time-steps to cover possible variations of boundary conditions to get aggregated results for airflow during summer in a couple of spaces in the house. The results were analyzed and values of the air change rates were extracted for the summer season. The role of each component involved in the natural ventilation process was identified through determination of the airflow pattern and break-down assessment. Simulations showed the stabilization of wind velocity inside the courtyard which protects the building against undesirable high velocities. The analysis demonstrated the efficiency of the distribution of openings as well as the role of the roof wind-escape in the enhancement of air circulation and the indoor air quality. For two different spaces, the wind escape device is found to increase the air change rates (ACH) as more as 25% and 60% than the 2-side ventilation case in which the ACH was increased as more as 45% and 27% than the single-side. The relationship between cross ventilation and indoor temperature was illustrated through the transient simulations."

abstract,"Abstract Courtyards are very popular in South China. They are considered to be micrometeorological modifiers and have great impacts on human thermal comfort and building energy consumption. Micrometeorological conditions, including air and surface temperatures, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, were continuously measured in both an enclosed courtyard and a semi-enclosed courtyard in Guangzhou on a sunny summer day. The performance of the CTTC (cluster thermal time constant) models with various calculation methods was tested against the recorded data for predicting courtyard air temperature. The results show that the daily courtyard air temperature variations were mainly caused by solar radiation. The solar radiation contribution was overestimated by only considering the radiation absorbed by the ground, and the thermal inertia was overestimated by calculating the cluster thermal time constant with an equivalent method. A new predictive model based on the CTTC model was proposed by integrating the impacts of ground and walls weighted by their surface areas. The performances of the model in the daily mean error, root mean square error and consistency index were determined to be 0.1 °C, 0.5 °C and 0.98, respectively, for the enclosed courtyard and 0.1 °C, 1.1 °C and 0.96, respectively, for the semi-enclosed courtyard. The model is beneficial to aid architects to evaluate courtyard micrometeorological conditions in early design stages."

abstract,"Abstract In modern building design, engineers are constantly facing challenging to find an optimal design to maintain a high level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants while minimizing the system energy consumption. Over the past decades, several algorithms have been proposed and developed for optimizing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system for indoor environment. Nevertheless, majority of these optimization algorithms are focused on single objective optimization procedures and require large training sample for surrogate modelling. For multi-objective HVAC design problems, previous studies introduced an arbitrary weighting factor to combine all design objectives into one single objective function. The near optimal solutions were however sensitive to the chosen value of the weighting factor. Aiming to develop a multi-objective optimization platform with minimal computational cost, this paper presents a nondominated sorting-based particle swarm optimization (NSPSO) algorithm together with the Kriging method to perform optimization for the HVAC system design of a typical office room. In addition, an adaptive sampling procedure is also proposed to enable the optimization platform to adjust the sampling point and resolution in constructing the training sample. Significant computational cost could be reduced without sacrificing the accuracy of the optimal solution. The proposed methods are applied and assessed in a typical HVAC system and the results indicate that comparing to traditional methods, the presented approach can handle multi-objective optimization in ventilation system with up to 46.6% saving of computational time."

abstract,"Abstract This article aims to investigate the influence of climate conditions and occupancy levels on the energy savings potential of a novel hydronic circuit configuration in active beam systems. This configuration consists of a room-temperature water loop, which delivers water at a temperature of 22 °C to all the zones in a building. An inherent characteristic of the circuit is that excess heat can be transferred from warm to cold zones when simultaneous need of heating and cooling occurs in the building. This process leads to a reduction of the annual energy use when comparing the novel configuration with traditional ones. The amount of energy reduction depends on the diversity of thermal loads applied to different zones in the building, which are mainly due to climate conditions and occupancy. Therefore, to capture the influence of these two factors on the heat transfer potential of the water loop, a parametric analysis was performed. Three climate locations and five occupancy levels were considered in a model of the system developed in Dymola. Simulation results show that heat transfer between zones leads to annual energy savings of between 7% and 27%, depending on the scenario considered. In absolute terms, the energy savings were between 1.6 kWh/m2 and 6.4 kWh/m2."

abstract,"Abstract The effects of dynamic controls on external massive shutter positioning are studied as refurbishment measure to reduce energy demand in residential buildings. This kind of shading device can not only regulate solar radiation, but it also provides additional thermal insulation that reduces heat conduction when closed. Based on their capability for controlling both processes, a comparison of different qualitative shutter positioning control strategies are proposed to minimize thermal energy demand. To this aim, a simulation model based on the constructive characteristics of an experimental building has been developed with TRNSYS. The results show that when more input variables are considered greater thermal demand reduction is achieved. However, the most relevant input variables for reducing thermal demand are solar radiation and real demand of the building. A large reduction in thermal energy demand is also displayed in the comparison between massive shutters, and non-massive blinds, increasing from 23% to 35%. Surprisingly, this improvement can be achieved using simple radiation-based control strategies, whereas the inclusion of heat conduction as control variable only improves the results by 0.2%. Therefore, there is no need to increase the complexity of the shading control of the massive shutters to take advantage of their insulation properties. The thermal energy reduction is comparable to the effect of refurbishment of an ordinary double-glazed window (U=2.46 W/(K·m2)) with high-efficiency triple-xenon glazing (U=0.59 W/(K·m2))."

abstract,"Abstract Numerous methods are available in various studies that investigate the optimization of central air conditioning systems. However, the majority of these studies focus on a single chiller or multiple chillers of identical capacity and type. Although the data indicated substantial energy conservation, all relevant findings were optimized under continuous concave functions, which cannot resolve the optimal load distributions of multiple-chiller plants commonly seen today due to their discontinuous properties. This study targets a large public exhibition venue, which uses a central air conditioning system consisting of heterogeneous chillers: fixed /variable frequency screw chillers, and centrifugal chillers. This system adopts a manual method (MM) for controlling the on/off operation of chillers; after an extended period of monitoring and collecting data, the operational characteristics of each chiller are better understood. This study uses the neural network (NN) to establish a chiller power consumption model, which considers the operating constrains of various types of chillers to ensure stable operation of the chiller plant. Genetic algorithm (GA) is also integrated while satisfying cooling load conditions to optimize chiller loading and determine the minimum power consumption of chiller plant. This is achieved by overcoming the deficiency of the traditional method, which fails to converge at low loads, and liberating from the restrictions limited by discontinuous functions. The results show that integrating NN and GA (NNGA) between 95% and 55% cooling loads improved power savings compared to MM load distributions, saving total power consumption by approximately 14.55%. A simulation data analysis for a one-year operation period showed that the proposed method can save up to 16.68% in power consumption over the MM method on a monthly basis and is conclusively superior to the MM controlled chiller model. This proved that the NNGA method proposed in this study provides an effective solution for optimizing load distributions of common multiple-chiller plants in parallel operation."

abstract,"Abstract Over the past several decades, rapidly growing popularity of airline transportation has pushed many passengers and crew to focus on potential risk of contaminant transmission during commercial air travel. Understanding airflow dynamics and transport property within an aircraft cabin is critical to creating a healthy cabin environment and improving control of epidemics. This work reveals the temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region and evaluates impact of airflow’s large-scale flow structures (swing motion around the aisle region and large-scale vortices) on transport property by calculating traces of marked fluid particles (MFPs) passing through passengers’ exhalation area within a Boeing 737-200 cabin mock-up. The Peixoto theorem has been used to interpret temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region. Transport property within this single-aisle aircraft cabin is a mixed effect of the airflow’s swing motion, large-scale vortices and longitudinal airflow. Airflow’s swing motion around the aisle region tends to carry MFPs nearby across the aisle region and invade the large-scale vortex in the opposite side. The large-scale vortices try to control MFPs in its each separated zone. The airflow’s swing motion and large-scale vortices dominate MFPs’ latitudinal transmission, while longitudinal airflow dominates MFPs’ longitudinal transmission."

abstract,"Abstract To improve energy efficiency of office buildings in Tianjin, we select a prototypical high-rise office tower as an example and focus on the effect of geometric factors on building energy performance. These factors include the orientation, plane shape, floor area, plane shape factor (the ratio of the plane length to the plane width, only as regards to a rectangle-shaped plane), floor height, floor number and window-to-wall ratio. The simulation is performed in DesignBuilder, which integrates artificial lighting with instantaneous daylight during the energy simulation process. The geometric factors of the defined prototype are examined in both single-parameter and multi-parameter evaluations. As to the multi-parameter results, the energy saving rate can vary by up to 18.9%, and reducing the floor height is observed to be the most effective means of reducing annual total end-use energy consumption, followed by increasing the plane shape factor and reducing the floor area. The results can serve as a reference for passive design strategies related to geometric factors in the early design stage."

abstract,"Abstract An explosion while repairing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) taxis in a garage located at the ground level of an old residential building constructed in Hong Kong was reported in 2015. Part of the building structures was damaged with the owners staying inside killed. The cause of explosion is still under investigation, but the explosion source can be due to leaking of LPG fuel or flammable clean refrigerants with LPG. A taxi has over 0.5 kg of refrigerant HFC134a (R134a) stored in the air-conditioning unit. A pressure rise exceeding 21 kPa (or 0.21 bar) due to explosion from a small amount of LPG would give damages to the building. As firefighters are always exposing themselves to the risk of explosion when they are carrying out rescue operation in a gas-filled environment, the explosion overpressure has to be more reliably estimated for working out protection schemes during operation. This garage LPG explosion incident was studied numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamics software FLame ACceleration Simulation (FLACS). Three scenarios of different LPG-air mixture volumes and LPG concentrations were investigated. Dispersion of LPG was simulated first with an ignition taken at a position at the garage centre. Overpressure and temperature rise were predicted using a fine grid system with 1 657 600 computing cells was employed. Results  were compared with numerical predictions using coarse grids of 207 200 cells. Discussion and conclusions were made with reference to the threshold value of 21 kPa in overpressure."

abstract,"Abstract This paper reports the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of sidewall automatic fire sprinklers installed adjacent to and in close proximity to the trains to suppress the fire at the undercarriage of the trains in the stabling yard, for the sake of protection of the train assets. Plume cooling due to water spray from fast response sprinklers is simulated with the sprinkler model available in Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Concurrently, fire suppression due to the interaction between the water and fire source is simply modelled with the assumption of an exponential reduction of the prescribed burning/pyrolysis rate. The objective is to gain some insight about the effectiveness of sidewall sprinklers proposed to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent trains. CFD simulation results demonstrate that it is highly likely that the undercarriage fire will spread to both the connected train-car and its adjacent train, if only overhead sprinklers are provided in the design. Due to the obstruction posed by the train, water cannot reach the fire source. Sidewall sprinklers are very effective to detect, control, suppress and even extinguish the fire, hence preventing the spread of fire. When sidewall sprinklers are installed on both sides of the trains, further asset protection may be extended successfully to the connected train cars. This study implies that the installation of sidewall sprinklers may be a practical solution for the protection of train assets in the stabling yard."

abstract,"Abstract A simulation model for heating different cooking oils including soybean, safflower, canola, olive, peanut and sunflower oils was developed using Aspen Plus. The simulation results showed that in contrast to indoor air temperature, increases in heating temperature and relative humidity, resulted in higher particulate matter (PM) mass emission rates and saturation ratio values. Olive oil showed the highest PM mass emission rate among all of the oils. Triolein was the dominant triglyceride in the PM emitted from all of the heated oils such that its high mass fraction in PM was influential in PM physical properties. Decamethylcyclo-pentasiloxane showed the highest mass fraction in PM compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Addition of the salt to the soybean oil reduced triglyceride masses in the PM. The emission rates of triolein, trigadolein and triarachidin were reduced by 45.64%, 47.13% and 48.30%, respectively. PM surface tension for all of the oils increased with indoor relative humidity, while viscosity decreased."

abstract,"Abstract Inflow conditions play a key role in the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of wind environment. Taking the micro wind climate of Hong Kong Kowloon Bay costal town as a research object, two kinds of widely used inflow condition determination methods are adopted to test their performances. One is to fit the velocity profile into the empirical (logarithmic/exponential) law, hereafter referred to as the Fitted Empirical Profile (FEP) method. The other is to interpolate the outflow velocities and turbulence properties from a pre-simulation of the upstream region, hereafter referred to as the Interpolated Multiscale Profile (IMP) method. The GIS data of this mountainous/ urban area are digitalized and simplified into the CFD geometry model. Computational treatments for numerical algorithms, domain size, grid systems and boundary conditions are carefully configured according to the published CFD Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). By validating with one year of real scale wind measurement data from two meteorological stations, it is found that these two inflow conditions lead to considerably different results. Having less consideration for the blockage effects of terrain/buildings, the FEP method tends to predict higher wind speed. As more thermal effects are removed by increasing wind speed thresholds, the results of IMP method demonstrate an incremental agreement with the measurement data. Finally, the validated simulation results are applied to the spatial representativeness assessment of two meteorological stations. Both the point-to-surface consistency indicator and point-centered semivariance are employed. The results show that the meteorological stations show a good representation within a range of 400 m."

abstract,"Abstract This paper considers pre-retrofit and post-retrofit lighting energy end-use of two sub-metered office spaces. Building lighting retrofits are typically installed to reduce energy consumption and operational costs of buildings. This traditionally includes replacing lights and introducing Building Management System (BMS). Through this process, an occupant’s ability to override new computerized controls could be compromised, which can dramatically affect the overall success of the project. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the effectiveness of the lighting retrofit, influence of the BMS upgrade, occupant behavior, and the lessons learned. The analysis comprises three different phases including one pre-retrofit and two post-retrofit phases. Each of the retrofit phases lasted approximately one year, leading to the monitoring of three years of sub-metered lighting energy end-use. The results showed that when the occupants had access to the lighting switches while BMS managed the operational lighting schedule, the office area with the responsible occupant saved 23.2% compared to the pre-retrofit phase. For the second lighting retrofit phase when the occupants did not have access to the light switches, the lighting schedule operated for more than two hours after the typical work day and the occupant was not able to turn off the lights upon departure. It should be noted that there are limited numbers of studies that consider three years sub-metered lighting retrofit data with the presented granularities in this study. Similar lighting retrofit projects could benefit from the findings of this study. Finally, the results of this sub-metered lighting data could address uncertainty in the selection of lighting power density and associated schedules of building energy simulations."

abstract,"Abstract Trigeneration is a strategic deployment to achieve the energy saving target in response to climate change mitigation. Appropriate choice of prime movers is paramount to make trigeneration feasible. It is common for trigeneration to be considered in district-wide application; however, there is little study on the effectiveness of various available prime movers in building-scale use. As such, diesel engine (DE), gas engine (GE), gas turbine with recuperator, and combined gas turbine cycle (CGTC) were involved as prime mover options for trigeneration in this study. Through year-round dynamic simulation, the energy and environmental performances of different trigeneration systems were thoroughly evaluated for a high-rise hotel building in subtropical climate. It was found that the DE-primed trigeneration would have the highest primary energy saving, while the CGTC-primed trigeneration would be the largest in carbon emissions cut. However, the GE-primed trigeneration system was deemed to be the best choice with both energy merit and system simplicity. It was also found that the part-load performance of prime mover and the required fuel type were closely associated to the annual energy and environmental performances."

abstract,"Abstract The efficiency of air curtain in reducing infiltration and associated energy usage is currently evaluated statically by using an efficiency factor, η air, based on single steady/static condition, which is often not the case for actual buildings under variable weather conditions and door usages. Based on a new method to consider these dynamic effects on air curtains, this study uses a dynamic efficiency factor η B in terms of whole building site end-use energy to assess the efficiency of air curtains when compared to single doors (i.e. without air curtains) and vestibule doors. Annual energy simulations were conducted for two reference building models considering their specific door usage schedules in 16 climate zone locations in the North America. The variations of the proposed efficiency factor for different climate zones illustrated the dynamic impacts of weather, building, unit fan energy and door usage frequency on air curtain efficiency. A sensitivity study was also conducted for the operation temperature conditions of air curtain and showed that η B also considers these operational conditions. It was thus concluded that using whole building site end-use energy to calculate the efficiency factor, ηB, can provide more realistic estimates of the performance of air curtains operations in buildings than the existing static efficiency factor."

abstract,"Abstract Virtual acoustics provides a highly useful tool for the investigation into the influence that spatial transformations may exert on indoor acoustics of cathedrals, which are remarkable spaces due to their heritage value, complexity and multifunctional character. The spatial organization of cathedrals is primarily governed by the location of the choir, which represents the main musical expression. Following various reforms, certain European cathedrals undertook a relocation of the choir stalls from their original position. The Cathedral of Granada is a highly significant case. Since its original construction, three major changes have occurred due to the relocation of the choir. In this article, simulation of indoor acoustics is employed to recover the soundfield in each of these three configurations. An extensive analysis compares the results of the main acoustic parameters in each of the virtual reconstruction models. Consequently, acoustic models are created and then calibrated based on a campaign of onsite measurements."

abstract,"Abstract In areas with poor ambient air quality, indoor particle concentrations can be significantly affected by particulate matter originating outdoors. The indoor environments of multi-zone and multi-story buildings are affected differently by outdoor particles compared with single-family houses, because of the buildings’ more complicated airflow characteristics. The objective of this study is to analyze outdoor particle penetration and transport, and their impact on indoor air, in a multi-zone and multi-story building using a CONTAMW simulation. For the airflow and particle transport analysis, the building leakage, penetration coefficients, and deposition rates were determined by on-site experiments. The results of airflow simulations for cold winters show that outdoor air infiltrates through the lower part of building and exfiltrates from the upper part. The results of the particle simulation also indicated that the airflow characteristics, combined with deposition rates, cause the lower floors of a multi-story building to be exposed to higher fine particle concentrations compared with the upper floors of the building. The study demonstrated that the CONTAMW simulation can be useful in analyzing the impact of outdoor particles on indoor environments through the identification of key particle transport parameters and validated airflow simulations."

abstract,"Abstract This paper focuses on the effectiveness of passive adaptation measures against climate change, in the medium (2036–2065) and long term (2066–2095), for three case studies located in Florence (central Italy). In order to identify and highlight the passive measures which can provide comfort conditions with the lowest net heating and cooling energy demand, the input assumptions consider a constant thermal comfort level and don’t take into account either the effect of HVAC system’s performance and the degradation of the materials by ageing. The study results show that, in case of poorly insulated buildings, on the medium term, the reduction of energy needed for heating could be bigger than the increase for cooling, resulting in a total annual net energy need decrease, while in the long term the opposite happens. Conversely, considering a high level of thermal insulation, due to the large increase in cooling demand, the total annual energy need rises in both periods. Furthermore, attention should be paid to internal loads and solar gains that, due to the projected climate change, could become main contributors to the energy balance. In general, since the magnitude of energy need increase for cooling and decrease for heating is very significant on the long term, and varies in function of the type of building, the passive measure adopted and the level of thermal insulation, the research results lead to pay close attention to different types of energy refurbishment interventions, that should be selected in function of their effectiveness over time."

abstract,"Abstract Between 2000 and 2015, annual electric peak demand in Kuwait has doubled to 15000 MW and the Ministry of Energy and Water expects this number to double once more by 2030 attributing 70% of this growth to new housing projects. Within this context, this manuscript evaluates the effect of incorporating PCM-wallboards in low-rise air-conditioned residential heavyweight buildings in Kuwait. Using an EnergyPlus single-zone model, a parametric study is performed considering several window-to-wall ratios (WWRs), different solar orientations and some PCM-wallboards configurations. The main study goals are to: (i) explore the validity of a single PCM-wallboard solution that can be universally applied throughout residential buildings in Kuwait; (ii) evaluate the impact of PCMwallboard on the reduction of both cooling demand and peak-loads; (iii) provide some guidelines for incorporating PCM-wallboards in Kuwait. Following an extensive parametric study, a 4 cm thick PCM-wallboard with a melting-peak temperature of 24 °C yielded the lowest annual cooling demand across a variety of room orientations and WWRs assuming cooling setpoint of 24 °C. Its implementation led to annual cooling energy savings of 4%–5% across all the case-studies. Regarding the impact throughout the year, cooling demand and peak-loads can be reduced by 5%–7% during summer months. The average daily cooling loads can be reduced by 5%–8%."

abstract,"Abstract Quality assurance in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is essential for an accurate and reliable assessment of complex indoor airflow. Two important aspects are the limitation of numerical diffusion and the appropriate choice of inlet conditions to ensure the correct amount of physical diffusion. This paper presents an assessment of the impact of both numerical and physical diffusion on the predicted flow patterns and contaminant distribution in steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations of mixing ventilation at a low slot Reynolds number (Re≈2,500). The simulations are performed on five different grids and with three different spatial discretization schemes; i.e. first-order upwind (FOU), second-order upwind (SOU) and QUICK. The impact of physical diffusion is assessed by varying the inlet turbulence intensity (TI) that is often less known in practice. The analysis shows that: (1) excessive numerical and physical diffusion leads to erroneous results in terms of delayed detachment of the wall jet and locally decreased velocity gradients; (2) excessive numerical diffusion by FOU schemes leads to deviations (up to 100%) in mean velocity and concentration, even on very high-resolution grids; (3) difference between SOU and FOU on the coarsest grid is larger than difference between SOU on coarsest grid and SOU on 22 times finer grid; (4) imposing TI values from 1% to 100% at the inlet results in very different flow patterns (enhanced or delayed detachment of wall jet) and different contaminant concentrations (deviations up to 40%); (5) impact of physical diffusion on contaminant transport can markedly differ from that of numerical diffusion."

Microclimate parameters were obtained from in-situ experiments and used as boundary conditions and validation of the numerical experiments with a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis tool using the standard k–ε model. Good agreements were obtained with less than 10% deviations between the measured and simulated results. Subsequent upon successful validation, the model was used to investigate hygrothermal and airflow profile within the shelves holding stored components in the facility. The predicted in-shelf hygrothermal profile was superimposed on mould growth limiting curve earlier documented in the literature. Results  revealed the growth of xerophilic species in most parts of the shelves. The mould growth prediction was found in correlation with the microbial investigation in the case-studied room reported by the authors elsewhere. Satisfactory prediction of mould growth in the room successfully proved that the CFD simulation can be used to investigate the conditions that lead to microbial growth in the indoor environment."

The results show that the relative errors of the two algorithms to the harmonic response method or to the direct solution method are all less than 1%, and the solving time with the two MOR algorithms decreases greatly. In addition, the Krylov subspace MOR algorithm has a faster solving speed and is more suitable for solving the heat transfer through a building envelope than the balanced truncation MOR algorithm."

abstract,"Abstract Building simulation based optimization involves direct coupling of the optimization algorithm to a simulation model, making it computationally intensive. To overcome this issue, an approach is proposed using a combination of experimental design techniques (fractional factorial design and response surface methodology). These techniques approximate the simulation model behavior using surrogate models, which are several orders of magnitude faster than the simulation model. Fractional factorial design is used to identify the significant design variables. Response surface methodology is used to create surrogate models for the annual cooling and lighting energy with the screened significant variables. The error for these models is less than 10%, validating their effectiveness. These surrogate models speed up optimization with genetic algorithms, for single- and multi-objective optimization problems and scenario analyses, resulting in a better solution. Thus, optimization becomes possible within reasonable computational time with the proposed methodology. This framework is illustrated using the case study of a three-storey office building for New Delhi."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a new technique for and the results of normalizing building energy consumption to enable a fair comparison among various types of buildings located near different weather stations across the United States. The method was developed for the U.S. Building Energy Asset Score, a whole-building energy efficiency rating system focusing on building envelope, mechanical systems, and lighting systems. The Asset Score is based on simulated energy use under standard operating conditions. Existing weather normalization methods such as those based on heating and cooling degrees days are not robust enough to adjust all climatic factors such as humidity and solar radiation. In this work, over 1000 sets of climate coefficients were developed to separately adjust building heating, cooling, and fan energy use at each weather station in the United States. This paper also presents a robust, standardized weather station mapping based on climate similarity rather than choosing the closest weather station. This proposed simulated-based climate adjustment was validated through testing on several hundreds of thousands of modeled buildings. Results  indicated the developed climate coefficients can adjust the climate variations to enable a fair comparison of building energy efficiency."

abstract,"Abstract The window/door opening behavior of occupants is a very important factor in determining the airflows and ventilation conditions in buildings, on which indoor pollutant concentration and transport are highly dependent. A two-room residence model was simulated in this study to analyze the airflow characteristics and pollutant transport under different window/door opening behaviors. Airflows were unidirectional and the residence could not be treated as a well-mixed zone when there were no temperature differences. If there were temperature differences, two-way airflow occurred at the exterior window of the room when it was open and the interior door was closed, resulting in a much larger ventilation rate than the situation without temperature differences. Strong two-way airflow occurred at the interior door in the case of the exterior window closed and interior door open, as the air in the two connected rooms was well mixed after the interior door was opened for tens of minutes. The ventilation rate of the room with double-sided ventilation was much higher than that of the room with single-sided ventilation, even though the total opening areas were the same. Opening the exterior window and closing the interior door could effectively remove pollutants from a polluted room and prevent their transport to a clean room. Field experiments were performed and the main conclusions of the simulation were verified."

abstract,"Abstract The compartment fires have been studied through full-scale experiments, which were conducted in a compartment of size 4 m × 4 m × 4 m with a door of size 2 m (height) × 1 m (width). Four different experiments were performed, in which the width of the door was varied. The diesel fuel pan of 60 cm diameter was placed in the center of compartment. The maximum heat release rates measured were 502, 564, 446 and 124 kW for Exp. 1, Exp. 2, Exp. 3 and Exp. 4 respectively. The average hot gas temperature in Exp. 1, Exp. 2, Exp. 3 and Exp. 4 were found to be 266, 328, 314, and 174 °C respectively. In Exp. 3, highest heat flux was found to be 13.6 kW at ceiling. Further, the numerical simulations were performed for Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 experimental condition using Fire Dynamics Simulator incorporating different mesh sizes."

abstract,"Abstract NetZero Energy Homes (NZEHs) have emerged as a solution to alleviate the energy demand from residential building operation, where appropriate design of building envelope and mechanical system is a means to achieving energy conservation and recovery for NZEHs. This research thus proposes an informed decision making framework for NZEH building design based on an automated energy simulation approach. The Batch Version of HOT2000 is utilized to achieve automated single-factor and combined-factor simulations, and a total of 16 200 combinations of building envelope and mechanical device design options are simulated for NZEH design. An NZEH project in Edmonton, Canada, is utilized as the case study in this research. The initial design of the NZEH results in an estimated energy deficit of 6048.0 MJ, accounting for 8.8% of the total consumption, and, based on the combined-factor simulations results, improved design scenarios are recommended for this NZEH. The simulation results of the initial design are also validated using the monitored data, with the actual performance showing an energy deficit of 4.1% of total consumption. Furthermore, such analysis as regression, factor importance ranking, and temperature set-point simulation are also conducted for the NZEH building design. This research proposes a framework to support informed design decision making for NZEHs, and builds a baseline for future study."

abstract,"Abstract The particle concentrations outside and inside two historical churches were monitored for at least ten months. The highest levels of outdoor concentrations were recorded in winter. This was caused by high levels of particle emissions from the burning of predominantly solid fuel for domestic heating in premises around the two churches monitored. These high levels of particle concentrations declined over the warmer periods of the year with the lowest concentrations occurring in the summer months. Owing to the marked winter–summer pattern for outdoor concentrations, the particles of outdoor origin accounted for 80%–90% of the overall indoor particle concentrations in the period of predominantly cold weather conditions (December to March) and for 50%–60% in the warm period (June to September). Reducing air exchange between the external space and the church interiors by keeping windows and doors closed had a limited effect on the reduction of average particle concentrations indoors (by less than 10%). A controlled air exchange system, which would increase the ventilation of a church when the particle concentration outdoors is lower than indoors and reduce ventilation when the outdoor air is polluted, would produce a further reduction of 10% in the indoor average particle concentration. The general conclusion is that the protection of the interiors of historical churches against soiling is primarily achieved by the improved particle filtering capacity of building envelopes and the gradual reduction of the overall outdoor particle concentration. Use of air cleaning systems with particle filtration may be a viable long-term option."

abstract,"Abstract Smoke contamination in upper balconies of shopping mall atriums presents a significant hazard to occupants by affecting evacuation and risking lives. Past research investigated the effects of varying balcony breadth, fire compartment opening width and fire size on smoke contamination. However, effects of varying the down stand depth at the fire compartment opening on smoke contamination have not been investigated. The down stand structure is widely used in shopping malls shops to display the trade names. This research investigates the effect of down stand depth on smoke contamination occurrence and severity in atrium upper balconies by varying the down stand depth together with the previously investigated parameters by utilizing Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Results  demonstrated that the extent of smoke contamination increased with increased down stand depth. CFD simulation results showed that as down stand depth increased, from no down stand to 0.1 m in 1/10 scaled model, smoke severity increased by up to 40%. An empirical correlation was also developed to predetermine the smoke contamination height by relating the above mentioned variables in a single correlation."

abstract,"Abstract Particles emitted from vehicles can threaten human health. Therefore the investigations about the particle dispersion characteristics inside the street canyon are of significance. For the current work, the airflow fields and the particle movement inside an isolated street canyon with three aspect ratios under perpendicular wind direction and two typical wind speeds are studied numerically, for which the particle distributions are obtained by solving the drift-flux model. The conclusions demonstrate that the trees will result in the particles gathering. However, the particle deposition fluxes on the trees are so small which cannot effectively remove the particles from the ambient air. Besides, the vehicles tend to cluster particles around the street axis and slow down the dispersion to the curbside buildings. Therefore, the vehicles should not be ignored in the numerical models, especially for the cases in the wind direction of 90°. Moreover the cases with the aspect ratio of 0.5 are more sensitive to the effects of trees and vehicles. The shop vendors expose to the highest particle concentrations in most of the scenarios."

The percentage of uncomfortable hours per year was defined in terms of the PPD index (Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) as the fraction of time in which PPD > 20%. Optimal combinations were determined for each city, and it was found that the major effects of the solar reflectance and infrared emissivity occur in cities featuring climates whose ambient temperature is not far away from the comfortable temperature range. The maximum reduction of percentage of uncomfortable hours due to combined effect of solar reflectance and infrared emissivity ranging from 1.9% to 40.6%."

abstract,"Abstract Stair evacuation plays a crucial role in building evacuation since stairs are generally the only means to evacuate high-rises on fire. To ensure safety stair design, the Life Safety Code suggests using a performance-based design approach, which requires evacuation simulations. Most of existing simulations, however, do not consider the structure of stairs and fatigue of evacuees, and these simulations are not validated by real emergency events or experiments. This paper is on improving the simulation of pedestrian flow in the stairs of high-rises by addressing these issues. A new Cellular Automata simulation model is developed where the simulation map is divided into zones based on the stair structure, and the rule of evacuees’ movement for each zone is appropriately defined to simulate turning behavior. To validate the simulation, a fire drill was held in two high-rise buildings. In this drill, evacuees felt tired after a walk. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the simulation without fatigue factor, our simulation can predict the evacuation time more accurately. Building designers can make evacuation plans and strategies based on the new simulation."

abstract,"Abstract Air pollution is becoming more and more severe in large cities. Accurate and rapid identification of outdoor pollutant sources can facilitate proper and effective air quality management in urban environments. Traditional “trial–error” process is time consuming and is incapacity in distinguishing multiple potential sources, which is common in urban pollution. Inverse prediction methods such as probability based adjoint modelling method have shown viability for locating indoor contaminant sources. This paper advances the adjoint probability method to track outdoor pollutant sources of constant release. The study develops an inverse modelling algorithm that can promptly locate multiple outdoor pollutant sources with limited pollution information detected by a movable sensor. Two numerical field experiments are conducted to illustrate and verify the predictions: one in an open space and the other in an urban environment. The developed algorithm promptly and accurately identifies the source locations in both cases. The requirement of an accurate urban building model is the primary prerequisite of the developed algorithm for urban application."

abstract,"Abstract As one of the most basic parameters, manikin body feature could be an important factor influencing the airflow and temperature fields in indoor environments. This study aims to improve the computational efficiency by optimising and simplifying manikin body features. A 3D scanned computer-simulated person (CSP) with extremely detailed body features was employed, followed by two simplified CSP models with different approaches. One of the simplified models was rebuilt based on the skeleton of the 3D scanned model with very limited body features, while the other model was simplified by removing some of the features from the 3D scanned model. All CSPs were tested under quiescent condition, followed by further comparisons under displacement and mixed ventilations. The outcomes indicated that the geometric difference of manikin body would have significant impact on the airflow patterns near manikin bodies, whilst it has very limited influence on the temperature field. The difference of body features could significantly affect the development of thermal plume, which mainly reflected above the manikin head. Also, change of CSP body features due to simplifications may become more sensitive to the predicted results under mixed ventilation, as a result of fewer interactions between the thermal plume and injected airflow."

abstract,"Abstract Chinese Kangs are widely used for home space heating in rural residences. However, the energy efficiency of a traditional Kang is less than 20%. Thus, the hot-wall Kang is gradually becoming popular in Jilin, Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia of China because of its higher energy efficiency, comfortable indoor thermal environment and flexibility of application. The hot-wall Kang has three operation modes. The heat transfer model of Kang in previous studies was developed based on the three assumptions, which include the uniform Kang surface temperature, the neglect of the radiation effect of gas and the thermal storage of ash soil layer. However, the model of hot-wall Kang in this paper was improved with respect to the three assumptions, which were discussed in this paper. Then, the model was validated by experiments and applied to optimize the thermal performance of the hot-wall Kang. The results showed that the simulation results were in good agreement with the measurement results. Furthermore, based on the verified model, the better thickness and material of the cover board were found to be 0.06 m and foam concrete, respectively."

The batteries are represented by a simplified system in the form of a rectangular cell, in which strong vertical electric current flows through three horizontal layers: the layer of a heavy metal at the bottom, the layer of a light metal at the top, and the layer of electrolyte in the middle. A new two-dimensional nonlinear model based on the conservative shallow water approximation is derived and utilized in a numerical study. It is found that in the case of small density difference between the electrolyte and one of the metals, the instability closely resembles the rolling pad instability observed earlier in the aluminum reduction cells. When the two electrolyte-metal density differences are comparable, the dynamics of unstable systems is more complex and characterized by interaction between two nearly synchronized or nearly anti-synchronized interfacial waves."

abstract,"Abstract Flow control has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical works. We analyze full-order, optimal controllers for large dynamical systems in the presence of multiple actuators and sensors. The full-order controllers do not require any preliminary model reduction or low-order approximation: this feature allows us to assess the optimal performance of an actuated flow without relying on any estimation process or further hypothesis on the disturbances. We start from the original technique proposed by Bewley et al. (Meccanica 51(12):2997–3014, 2016.  https://doi.org/10.1007/s11012-016-0547-3), the adjoint of the direct-adjoint (ADA) algorithm. The algorithm is iterative and allows bypassing the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation associated with the optimal control problem, typically infeasible for large systems. In this numerical work, we extend the ADA iteration into a more general framework that includes the design of controllers with multiple, coupled inputs and robust controllers (\(\mathcal {H}_{\infty }\) methods). First, we demonstrate our results by showing the analytical equivalence between the full Riccati solutions and the ADA approximations in the multiple inputs case. In the second part of the article, we analyze the performance of the algorithm in terms of convergence of the solution, by comparing it with analogous techniques. We find an excellent scalability with the number of inputs (actuators), making the method a viable way for full-order control design in complex settings. Finally, the applicability of the algorithm to fluid mechanics problems is shown using the linearized Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation and the Kármán vortex street past a two-dimensional cylinder."

abstract,"Abstract Whenever linear eigenmodes of open flows are computed on a numerical domain that is truncated in the streamwise direction, artificial boundary conditions may give rise to spurious pressure signals that are capable of providing unwanted perturbation feedback to upstream locations. The manifestation of such feedback in the eigenmode spectrum is analysed here for two simple configurations. First, explicitly prescribed feedback in a Ginzburg–Landau model is shown to produce a spurious eigenmode branch, named the ‘arc branch’, that strongly resembles a characteristic family of eigenmodes typically present in open shear flow calculations. Second, corresponding mode branches in the global spectrum of an incompressible parallel jet in a truncated domain are examined. It is demonstrated that these eigenmodes of the numerical model depend on the presence of spurious forcing of a local \(k^+\) instability wave at the inflow, caused by pressure signals that appear to be generated at the outflow. Multiple local \(k^+\) branches result in multiple global eigenmode branches. For the particular boundary treatment chosen here, the strength of the pressure feedback from the outflow towards the inflow boundary is found to decay with the cube of the numerical domain length. It is concluded that arc branch eigenmodes are artefacts of domain truncation, with limited value for physical analysis. It is demonstrated, for the example of a non-parallel jet, how spurious feedback may be reduced by an absorbing layer near the outflow boundary."

abstract,"Abstract The opposed-jet counterflow configuration is widely used to measure fundamental flame properties that are essential targets for validating chemical kinetic models. The main and key assumption of the counterflow configuration in laminar flame experiments is that the flow field is steady and quasi-one-dimensional. In this study, experiments and numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the behavior and controlling parameters of counterflowing isothermal air jets for various nozzle designs, Reynolds numbers, and surrounding geometries. The flow field in the jets’ impingement region was analyzed in search of instabilities, asymmetries, and two-dimensional effects that can introduce errors when the data are compared with results of quasi-one-dimensional simulations. The modeling involved transient axisymmetric numerical simulations along with bifurcation analysis, which revealed that when the flow field is confined between walls, local bifurcation occurs, which in turn results in asymmetry, deviation from the one-dimensional assumption, and sensitivity of the flow field structure to boundary conditions and surrounding geometry. Particle image velocimetry was utilized and results revealed that for jets of equal momenta at low Reynolds numbers of the order of 300, the flow field is asymmetric with respect to the middle plane between the nozzles even in the absence of confining walls. The asymmetry was traced to the asymmetric nozzle exit velocity profiles caused by unavoidable imperfections in the nozzle assembly. The asymmetry was not detectable at high Reynolds numbers of the order of 1000 due to the reduced sensitivity of the flow field to boundary conditions. The cases investigated computationally covered a wide range of Reynolds numbers to identify designs that are minimally affected by errors in the experimental procedures or manufacturing imperfections, and the simulations results were used to identify conditions that best conform to the assumptions of quasi-one-dimensional modeling."

abstract,"Abstract The “double-buffer problem” has been regarded as a crucial concern for the strategy behind the hybrid large eddy simulation (LES)/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model (or HLR model, for short). Such models are likely to show unphysical mean-velocity distributions in the LES–RANS interface region, where “super-streak structures” also appear that look like low-speed streaks generated in the near-wall region of wall turbulence. To overcome this difficulty, the stochastic backscatter model, in which the vortex structures in the interface region are divided into smaller scales, holds promise due to the effect of random source term imposed in the momentum equation. Although this method is effective, several parameters must be prescribed and their specification process is arbitrary and ambiguous. An alternative advanced HLR model has been proposed, in which an anisotropy-resolving subgrid-scale (SGS) model was adopted in the LES region as well as a one-equation nonlinear eddy viscosity model in the RANS region. Previous investigations indicated that this HLR model did not exhibit or, at least, largely reduced the “double-buffer problem” in the mean-velocity distribution, with no special treatment being applied. The main purpose of the present study is to reveal why this HLR model improves the predictive performance in the LES–RANS interface region. Specifically, we focus on the role of the extra anisotropic term introduced in the SGS model, finding that it plays an important role in enhancing vortex structures in the interface region, leading to a considerable improvement in model performance."

abstract,"Abstract Sensitivity of drag to tangential surface motion is calculated in flow past a circular cylinder in both two- and three-dimensional conditions at Reynolds number \(\textit{Re} \le 1000\). The magnitude of the sensitivity maximises in the region slightly upstream of the separation points where the contour lines of spanwise vorticity are normal to the cylinder surface. A control to reduce drag can be obtained by (negatively) scaling the sensitivity. The high correlation of sensitivities of controlled and uncontrolled flow indicates that the scaled sensitivity is a good approximation of the nonlinear optimal control. It is validated through direct numerical simulations that the linear range of the steady control is much higher than the unsteady control, which synchronises the vortex shedding and induces lock-in effects. The steady control injects angular momentum into the separating boundary layer, stabilises the flow and increases the base pressure significantly. At \(\textit{Re}=100\), when the maximum tangential motion reaches 50% of the free-stream velocity, the vortex shedding, boundary-layer separation and recirculation bubbles are eliminated and 32% of the drag is reduced. When the maximum tangential motion reaches 2.5 times of the free-stream velocity, thrust is generated and the power savings ratio, defined as the ratio of the reduced drag power to the control input power, reaches 19.6. The mechanism of drag reduction is attributed to the change of the radial gradient of spanwise vorticity (\(\partial _{r} \hat{\zeta }\)) and the subsequent accelerated pressure recovery from the uncontrolled separation points to the rear stagnation point."

abstract,"Abstract A numerical investigation is performed on the electroosmotic flow (EOF) in a surface-modulated microchannel to induce enhanced solute mixing. The channel wall is modulated by placing surface-mounted obstacles of trigonometric shape along which the surface potential is considered to be different from the surface potential of the homogeneous part of the wall. The characteristics of the electrokinetic flow are governed by the Laplace equation for the distribution of external electric potential; the Poisson equation for the distribution of induced electric potential; the Nernst–Planck equations for the distribution of ions; and the Navier–Stokes equations for fluid flow simultaneously. These nonlinear coupled set of governing equations are solved numerically by a control volume method over the staggered system. The influence of the geometric modulation of the surface, surface potential heterogeneity and the bulk ionic concentration on the EOF is analyzed. Vortical flow develops near a surface modulation, and it becomes stronger when the surface potential of the modulated region is in opposite sign to the surface potential of the homogeneous part of the channel walls. Vortical flow also depends on the Debye length when the Debye length is in the order of the channel height. Pressure drop along the channel length is higher for a ribbed wall channel compared to the grooved wall case. The pressure drop decreases with the increase in the amplitude for a grooved channel, but increases for a ribbed channel. The mixing index is quantified through the standard deviation of the solute distribution. Our results show that mixing index is higher for the ribbed channel compared to the grooved channel with heterogeneous surface potential. The increase in potential heterogeneity in the modulated region also increases the mixing index in both grooved and ribbed channels. However, the mixing performance, which is the ratio of the mixing index to pressure drop, reduces with the rise in the surface potential heterogeneity."

These simulations are used to assess how the behavior of this system at the atomistic length scale compares to continuum mechanics models. In order to determine the effective size of the particles, we calculate the solvent forces on spherical particles of different radii as a function of different positions near and overlapping with the atomistically defined wall and compare them to continuum models. This procedure also then determines the effective position of the wall. Our analysis is based solely on forces that the particles sense, ensuring self-consistency of the method. The simulations were carried out using both Weeks–Chandler–Andersen and modified Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials to identify the different contributions of simple repulsion and van der Waals attractive forces. Upon correction for behavior arising the discreteness of the atomic system, the underlying continuum physics analysis appeared to be correct down to much less than the particle radius. For both particle types, the effective radius was found to be \(\sim 0.75\sigma \), where \(\sigma \) defines the length scale of the force interaction (the LJ diameter). The effective “hydrodynamic” radii determined by this means are distinct from commonly assumed values of \(0.5\sigma \) and \(1.0\sigma \), but agree with a value developed from the atomistic analysis of the viscosity of such systems."

abstract,"Abstract Moist processes are among the most important drivers of atmospheric dynamics, and scale analysis and asymptotics are cornerstones of theoretical meteorology. Accounting for moist processes in systematic scale analyses therefore seems of considerable importance for the field. Klein and Majda (Theor Comput Fluid Dyn 20:525–551, 2006) proposed a scaling regime for the incorporation of moist bulk microphysics closures in multiscale asymptotic analyses of tropical deep convection. This regime is refined here to allow for mixtures of ideal gases and to establish consistency with a more general multiple scales modeling framework for atmospheric flows. Deep narrow updrafts, the so-called hot towers, constitute principal building blocks of larger scale storm systems. They are analyzed here in a sample application of the new scaling regime. A single quasi-one-dimensional upright columnar cloud is considered on the vertical advective (or tower life cycle) time scale. The refined asymptotic scaling regime is essential for this example as it reveals a new mechanism for the self-sustainance of such updrafts. Even for strongly positive convectively available potential energy, a vertical balance of buoyancy forces is found in the presence of precipitation. This balance induces a diagnostic equation for the vertical velocity, and it is responsible for the generation of self-sustained balanced updrafts. The time-dependent updraft structure is encoded in a Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the precipitation mixing ratio. Numerical solutions of this equation suggest that the self-sustained updrafts may strongly enhance hot tower life cycles."

abstract,"Abstract The effect of local forcing on the separated, three-dimensional shear layer downstream of a backward-facing step is investigated by means of large-eddy simulation for a Reynolds number based on the step height of 10,700. The step edge is either oriented normal to the approaching turbulent boundary layer or swept at an angle of \(40^\circ \). Oblique vortices with different orientation and spacing are generated by wavelike suction and blowing of fluid through an edge parallel slot. The vortices exhibit a complex three-dimensional structure, but they can be characterized by a wavevector in a horizontal section plane. In order to determine the step-normal component of the wavevector, a method is developed based on phase averages. The dependence of the wavevector on the forcing parameters can be described in terms of a dispersion relation, the structure of which indicates that the disturbances are mainly convected through the fluid. The introduced vortices reduce the size of the recirculation region by up to 38%. In both the planar and the swept case, the most efficient of the studied forcings consists of vortices which propagate in a direction that deviates by more than \(50^\circ \) from the step normal. These vortices exhibit a spacing in the order of 2.5 step heights. The upstream shift of the reattachment line can be explained by increased mixing and momentum transport inside the shear layer which is reflected in high levels of the Reynolds shear stress \(-\rho \overline{u'v'}\). The position of the maximum of the coherent shear stress is found to depend linearly on the wavelength, similar to two-dimensional free shear layers."

We present an expression for the probability that a given large drop suffers a given number of collisions, for a general statistically homogeneous distribution of droplets. We hope that our approach will serve as a valuable tool in dealing with droplet distribution in real clouds, which has been found to deviate from the idealized Poisson distribution due to mechanisms such as inertial clustering."

abstract,"Abstract A leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) that is derived from potential flow theory as a measure of suction at the airfoil leading edge is used to study initiation of leading-edge vortex (LEV) formation in this article. The LESP hypothesis is presented, which states that LEV formation in unsteady flows for specified airfoil shape and Reynolds number occurs at a critical constant value of LESP, regardless of motion kinematics. This hypothesis is tested and validated against a large set of data from CFD and experimental studies of flows with LEV formation. The hypothesis is seen to hold except in cases with slow-rate kinematics which evince significant trailing-edge separation (which refers here to separation leading to reversed flow on the aft portion of the upper surface), thereby establishing the envelope of validity. The implication is that the critical LESP value for an airfoil–Reynolds number combination may be calibrated using CFD or experiment for just one motion and then employed to predict LEV initiation for any other (fast-rate) motion. It is also shown that the LESP concept may be used in an inverse mode to generate motion kinematics that would either prevent LEV formation or trigger the same as per aerodynamic requirements."

abstract,"Abstract Following the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code validation and verification proposal by Smolentsev et al. (Fusion Eng Des 100:65–72, 2015), we perform code to code and code to experiment comparisons between two computational solvers, FLUIDYN and HIMAG, which are presently considered as two of the prospective CFD tools for fusion blanket applications. In such applications, an electrically conducting breeder/coolant circulates in the blanket ducts in the presence of a strong plasma-confining magnetic field at high Hartmann numbers, \(\textit{Ha}\) (\(\textit{Ha}^2\) is the ratio between electromagnetic and viscous forces) and high interaction parameters, \(\textit{N}\) (\(\textit{N}\) is the ratio of electromagnetic to inertial forces). The main objective of this paper is to provide the scientific and engineering community with common references to assist fusion researchers in the selection of adequate computational means to be used for blanket design and analysis. As an initial validation case, the two codes are applied to the classic problem of a laminar fully developed MHD flows in a rectangular duct. Both codes demonstrate a very good agreement with the analytical solution for \(\textit{Ha}\) up to 15, 000. To address the capabilities of the two codes to properly resolve complex geometry flows, we consider a case of three-dimensional developing MHD flow in a geometry comprising of a series of interconnected electrically conducting rectangular ducts. The computed electric potential distributions for two flows (Case A) \(\textit{Ha}=515\), \(\textit{N}=3.2\) and (Case B) \(\textit{Ha}=2059\), \(\textit{N}=63.8\) are in very good agreement with the experimental data, while the comparisons for the MHD pressure drop are still unsatisfactory. To better interpret the observed differences, the obtained numerical data are analyzed against earlier theoretical and experimental studies for flows that involve changes in the relative orientation between the flow and the magnetic field."

abstract,"Abstract Görtler vortices develop along concave walls as a result of the imbalance between the centrifugal force and radial pressure gradient. In this study, we introduce a simple control strategy aimed at reducing the growth rate of Görtler vortices by locally modifying the surface geometry in spanwise and streamwise directions. Such wall deformations are accounted in the boundary region equations by using a Prandtl transform of dependent and independent variables. The vortex energy is then controlled via a classical proportional control algorithm for which either the wall-normal velocity or the wall shear stress serves as the control variable. Our numerical results indicate that the control algorithm is quite effective in minimizing the wall shear stress."

To demonstrate the validity of the moving bubble interface, the present simulations are compared with existing numerical and experimental results available in the literature; and for these comparisons, the computational geometries are considered same as reported in corresponding literatures. The present bubble deformation characteristics are satisfactorily agreeing with their literature counterparts. After establishing the validity of the numerical solution procedure, the same method is applied to obtain the deformation characteristics of an air bubble in Carreau model non-Newtonian fluids. Further, the results in terms of the volume fraction images, streamlines, and viscosity profiles around the deforming bubbles are presented as function of the bubble rise time."

One criterion was proven in a previous work, and a related criterion is proved here. These criteria are based on an inviscid regularization of the Euler equations known as the 3D Euler–Voigt equations, which are known to be globally well-posed. Moreover, simulations of the 3D Euler–Voigt equations also require less resolution than simulations of the 3D Euler equations for fixed values of the regularization parameter \(\alpha >0\). Therefore, the new blow-up criteria allow one to gain information about possible singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations indirectly, namely by simulating the better-behaved 3D Euler–Voigt equations. The new criteria are only known to be sufficient criterion for blow-up. Therefore, to test the robustness of the inviscid-regularization approach, we also investigate analogous criteria for blow-up of the 1D Burgers equation, where blow-up is well known to occur."

The RBC is considered as neo-Hookean elastic membrane with bending resistance. The motion and deformation of the RBC under different values of the Reynolds number are evaluated. In addition, the variations of blood flow resistance and time-averaged pressure due to the motion and deformation of the RBC are assessed. It was found that a healthy RBC moves faster than a sick one. The apparent viscosity and blood flow resistance are greater for the case involving the sick RBC. Blood pressure at the presence of stenosis and low deformable RBC increases, which is thought of as the reason of many serious diseases including cardiovascular diseases. As the Re number increases, the RBC deforms further and moves easier and faster through the stenosis. The results of this study were compared to the available experimental and numerical results, and good agreements were observed."

abstract,"Abstract The flow of two-dimensional drops on an inclined channel is studied by numerical simulations at finite Reynolds numbers. The effect of viscosity ratio on the behaviour of the two-phase medium is examined. The flow is driven by the acceleration due to gravity, and there is no pressure gradient along the flow direction. An implicit version of the finite difference/front-tracking method was developed and used in the present study. The lateral migration of a drop is studied first. It is found that the equilibrium position of a drop moves away from the channel floor as the viscosity ratio increases. However, the trend reverses beyond a certain viscosity ratio. Simulations with 40 drops in a relatively large channel show that there exists a limiting viscosity ratio where the drops behave like solid particles, and the effect of internal circulation of drops becomes negligible. This limiting condition resembles the granular flow regime except that the effect of interstitial fluid is present. The limiting viscosity ratio depends on the flow conditions (80 for \(Re=10\), and 200 for \(Re=20\)). There are two peaks in the areal fraction distribution of drops across the channel which is different from granular flow regime. It is also found that the peak in areal fraction distribution of drops moves away from the channel floor as the inclination angle of the channel increases."

The Dirichlet boundary condition for the parabolic equation is obtained from the solution of the ordinary differential equations, but this solution itself depends on the solution of the parabolic equations. We first present the governing equations describing diffusional growth of cloud particles. In a second step, we consider a simplified model problem, motivated by the diffusional growth equations. The main difference between the simplified model problem and the diffusional growth equations consists in neglecting the dependence of the domain for the parabolic equations on the solution. For the model problem, we show unique solvability using a fixed point method. Finally, we discuss application of the main result for the model problem to the diffusional growth equations and illustrate these equations with the help of a numerical solution."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents an analysis of the combined electro-osmotic and pressure-driven axial flows of viscoelastic fluids in a rectangular microchannel with arbitrary aspect ratios. The rheological behavior of the fluid is described by the complete form of Phan-Thien–Tanner (PTT) model with the Gordon–Schowalter convected derivative which covers the upper convected Maxwell, Johnson–Segalman and FENE-P models. Our numerical simulation is based on the computation of 2D Poisson–Boltzmann, Cauchy momentum and PTT constitutive equations. The solution of these governing nonlinear coupled set of equations is obtained by using the second-order central finite difference method in a non-uniform grid system and is verified against 1D analytical solution of the velocity profile with less than 0.06% relative error. Also, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of channel aspect ratio (width to height), wall zeta potential and the Debye–Hückel parameter on 2D velocity profile, volumetric flow rate and the Poiseuille number in the mixed EO/PD flows of viscoelastic fluids with different Weissenberg numbers. Our results show that, for low channel aspect ratios, the previous 1D analytical models underestimate the velocity profile at the channel half-width centerline in the case of favorable pressure gradients and overestimate it in the case of adverse pressure gradients. The results reveal that the inapplicability of the Debye–Hückel approximation at high zeta potentials is more significant for higher Weissenberg number fluids. Also, it is found that, under the specified values of electrokinetic parameters, there is a threshold for velocity scale ratio in which the Poiseuille number is approximately independent of channel aspect ratio."

This paper concerns with a new indicator, related to the sensitivity map of global stability problems, suitable for an optimal grid refinement that minimizes the global solution error. The new criterion is derived from the properties of the adjoint operator and provides a map of the sensitivity of the global error (or its estimate) to a local mesh refinement. Examples are presented for both a scalar partial differential equation and for the system of Navier–Stokes equations. In the last case, we also present a grid-adaptation algorithm based on the new estimator and on the \(FreeFem++\) software that improves the accuracy of the solution of almost two order of magnitude by redistributing the nodes of the initial computational mesh."

Numerical simulations allow to characterize this state up to \(Re\approx 270\) and confirm that it substantially differs from the steady-state solution which exists in the wake of a fixed, non-rotating sphere beyond the threshold \(Re^\mathrm{SS}=212\). A weakly nonlinear analysis is carried out and is shown to successfully reproduce the results and to give substantial improvement over a previous analysis (Fabre et al. in J Fluid Mech 707:24–36, 2012).

abstract,"Abstract Modal global linear instability analysis is performed using, for the first time ever, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to analyze incompressible flows with two and three inhomogeneous spatial directions. Four linearization models have been implemented in order to recover the linearized Navier–Stokes equations in the incompressible limit. Two of those models employ the single relaxation time and have been proposed previously in the literature as linearization of the collision operator of the lattice Boltzmann equation. Two additional models are derived herein for the first time by linearizing the local equilibrium probability distribution function. Instability analysis results are obtained in three benchmark problems, two in closed geometries and one in open flow, namely the square and cubic lid-driven cavity flow and flow in the wake of the circular cylinder. Comparisons with results delivered by classic spectral element methods verify the accuracy of the proposed new methodologies and point potential limitations particular to the LBM approach. The known issue of appearance of numerical instabilities when the SRT model is used in direct numerical simulations employing the LBM is shown to be reflected in a spurious global eigenmode when the SRT model is used in the instability analysis. Although this mode is absent in the multiple relaxation times model, other spurious instabilities can also arise and are documented herein. Areas of potential improvements in order to make the proposed methodology competitive with established approaches for global instability analysis are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract The pressure drag of blunt bluff bodies is highly relevant in many practical applications, including to the aerodynamic drag of road vehicles. This paper presents theory revealing that a mean drag reduction can be achieved by manipulating wake flow fluctuations. A linear feedback control strategy then exploits this idea, targeting attenuation of the spatially integrated base (back face) pressure fluctuations. Large-eddy simulations of the flow over a D-shaped blunt bluff body are used as a test-bed for this control strategy. The flow response to synthetic jet actuation is characterised using system identification, and controller design is via shaping of the frequency response to achieve fluctuation attenuation. The designed controller successfully attenuates integrated base pressure fluctuations, increasing the time-averaged pressure on the body base by 38%. The effect on the flow field is to push the roll-up of vortices further downstream and increase the extent of the recirculation bubble. This control approach uses only body-mounted sensing/actuation and input–output model identification, meaning that it could be applied experimentally."

abstract,"Abstract Optimization of natural convection-driven flows may provide significant improvements to the performance of cooling devices, but a theoretical investigation of such flows has been rarely done. The present paper illustrates an efficient gradient-based optimization method for analyzing such systems. We consider numerically the natural convection-driven flow in a differentially heated cavity with three Prandtl numbers (\(Pr=0.15{-}7\)) at super-critical conditions. All results and implementations were done with the spectral element code Nek5000. The flow is analyzed using linear direct and adjoint computations about a nonlinear base flow, extracting in particular optimal initial conditions using power iteration and the solution of the full adjoint direct eigenproblem. The cost function for both temperature and velocity is based on the kinetic energy and the concept of entransy, which yields a quadratic functional. Results  are presented as a function of Prandtl number, time horizons and weights between kinetic energy and entransy. In particular, it is shown that the maximum transient growth is achieved at time horizons on the order of 5 time units for all cases, whereas for larger time horizons the adjoint mode is recovered as optimal initial condition. For smaller time horizons, the influence of the weights leads either to a concentric temperature distribution or to an initial condition pattern that opposes the mean shear and grows according to the Orr mechanism. For specific cases, it could also been shown that the computation of optimal initial conditions leads to a degenerate problem, with a potential loss of symmetry. In these situations, it turns out that any initial condition lying in a specific span of the eigenfunctions will yield exactly the same transient amplification. As a consequence, the power iteration converges very slowly and fails to extract all possible optimal initial conditions. According to the authors’ knowledge, this behavior is illustrated here for the first time."

The flow field over the airfoil and in its wake has been computed by full three-dimensional direct numerical simulation at a chord Reynolds number of \(Re_{c}=1750\) and two angles of attack, \(\mathrm{{AoA}}=0^\circ \) and \(5^\circ \). Point-vortex methods have been employed to predict the inviscid counterpart of this flow. The spatial BiGlobal eigenvalue problem governing linear small-amplitude perturbations superposed upon the viscous three-dimensional wake has been solved at several axial locations, and results were used to initialize linear PSE-3D analyses without any simplifying assumptions regarding the form of the trailing vortex system, other than weak dependence of all flow quantities on the axial spatial direction. Two classes of linearly unstable perturbations were identified, namely stronger-amplified symmetric modes and weaker-amplified antisymmetric disturbances, both peaking at the vortex sheet which connects the trailing vortices. The amplitude functions of both classes of modes were documented, and their characteristics were compared with those delivered by local linear stability analysis in the wake near the symmetry plane and in the vicinity of the vortex core. While all linear instability analysis approaches employed have delivered qualitatively consistent predictions, only PSE-3D is free from assumptions regarding the underlying base flow and should thus be employed to obtain quantitative information on amplification rates and amplitude functions in this class of configurations."

abstract,"Abstract Numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the linear global stability behaviour of the Bödewadt, Ekman, von Kármán (BEK) family of flows, for cases where a disc rotates beneath an incompressible fluid that is also rotating. This extends the work reported in recent studies that only considered the rotating-disc boundary layer with a von Kármán configuration, where the fluid that lies above the boundary layer remains stationary. When a homogeneous flow approximation is made, neglecting the radial variation of the basic state, it can be shown that linearised disturbances are susceptible to absolute instability. We shall demonstrate that, despite this prediction of absolute instability, the disturbance development exhibits globally stable behaviour in the BEK boundary layers with a genuine radial inhomogeneity. For configurations where the disc rotation rate is greater than that of the overlying fluid, disturbances propagate radially outwards and there is only a convective form of instability. This replicates the behaviour that had previously been documented when the fluid did not rotate beyond the boundary layer. However, if the fluid rotation rate is taken to exceed that of the disc, then the propagation direction reverses and disturbances grow while convecting radially inwards. Eventually, as they approach regions of smaller radii, where stability is predicted according to the homogeneous flow approximation, the growth rates reduce until decay takes over. Given sufficient time, such disturbances can begin to diminish at every radial location, even those which are positioned outwards from the radius associated with the onset of absolute instability. This leads to the confinement of the disturbance development within a finitely bounded region of the spatial–temporal plane."

abstract,"Abstract The stability properties of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) compressible flows over a rectangular cavity with length-to-depth ratio of \(L/D=6\) are analyzed at a free-stream Mach number of \(M_\infty =0.6\) and depth-based Reynolds number of \(Re_D=502\). In this study, we closely examine the influence of three-dimensionality on the wake mode that has been reported to exhibit high-amplitude fluctuations from the formation and ejection of large-scale spanwise vortices. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) and bi-global stability analysis are utilized to study the stability characteristics of the wake mode. Using the bi-global stability analysis with the time-averaged flow as the base state, we capture the global stability properties of the wake mode at a spanwise wavenumber of \(\beta =0\). To uncover spanwise effects on the 2D wake mode, 3D DNS are performed with cavity width-to-depth ratio of \(W/D=1\) and 2. We find that the 2D wake mode is not present in the 3D cavity flow with \(W/D=2\), in which spanwise structures are observed near the rear region of the cavity. These 3D instabilities are further investigated via bi-global stability analysis for spanwise wavelengths of \(\lambda /D=0.5{-}2.0\) to reveal the eigenspectra of the 3D eigenmodes. Based on the findings of 2D and 3D global stability analysis, we conclude that the absence of the wake mode in 3D rectangular cavity flows is due to the release of kinetic energy from the spanwise vortices to the streamwise vortical structures that develops from the spanwise instabilities."

abstract,"Abstract The linearized pressure Poisson equation (LPPE) is used in two and three spatial dimensions in the respective matrix-forming solution of the BiGlobal and TriGlobal eigenvalue problem in primitive variables on collocated grids. It provides a disturbance pressure boundary condition which is compatible with the recovery of perturbation velocity components that satisfy exactly the linearized continuity equation. The LPPE is employed to analyze instability in wall-bounded flows and in the prototype open Blasius boundary layer flow. In the closed flows, excellent agreement is shown between results of the LPPE and those of global linear instability analyses based on the time-stepping nektar++, Semtex and nek5000 codes, as well as with those obtained from the FreeFEM++ matrix-forming code. In the flat plate boundary layer, solutions extracted from the two-dimensional LPPE eigenvector at constant streamwise locations are found to be in very good agreement with profiles delivered by the NOLOT/PSE space marching code. Benchmark eigenvalue data are provided in all flows analyzed. The performance of the LPPE is seen to be superior to that of the commonly used pressure compatibility (PC) boundary condition: at any given resolution, the discrete part of the LPPE eigenspectrum contains converged and not converged, but physically correct, eigenvalues. By contrast, the PC boundary closure delivers some of the LPPE eigenvalues and, in addition, physically wrong eigenmodes. It is concluded that the LPPE should be used in place of the PC pressure boundary closure, when BiGlobal or TriGlobal eigenvalue problems are solved in primitive variables by the matrix-forming approach on collocated grids."

abstract,"Abstract Reference solutions are important in several applications. They are used as base states in linear stability analyses as well as initial conditions and reference states for sponge zones in numerical simulations, just to name a few examples. Their accuracy is also paramount in both fields, leading to more reliable analyses and efficient simulations, respectively. Hence, steady-states usually make the best reference solutions. Unfortunately, standard marching schemes utilized for accurate unsteady simulations almost never reach steady-states of unstable flows. Steady governing equations could be solved instead, by employing Newton-type methods often coupled with continuation techniques. However, such iterative approaches do require large computational resources and very good initial guesses to converge. These difficulties motivated the development of a technique known as selective frequency damping (SFD) (Åkervik et al. in Phys Fluids 18(6):068102, 2006). It adds a source term to the unsteady governing equations that filters out the unstable frequencies, allowing a steady-state to be reached. This approach does not require a good initial condition and works well for self-excited flows, where a single nonzero excitation frequency is selected by either absolute or global instability mechanisms. On the other hand, it seems unable to damp stationary disturbances. Furthermore, flows with a broad unstable frequency spectrum might require the use of multiple filters, which delays convergence significantly. Both scenarios appear in convectively, absolutely or globally unstable flows. An alternative approach is proposed in the present paper. It modifies the coefficients of a marching scheme in such a way that makes the absolute value of its linear gain smaller than one within the required unstable frequency spectra, allowing the respective disturbance amplitudes to decay given enough time. These ideas are applied here to implicit multi-step schemes. A few chosen test cases shows that they enable convergence toward solutions that are unstable to stationary and oscillatory disturbances, with either a single or multiple frequency content. Finally, comparisons with SFD are also performed, showing significant reduction in computer cost for complex flows by using the implicit multi-step MGM schemes."

abstract,"Abstract A parametric study is presented for the incompressible, zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary layer perturbed by streamwise vortices. The vortices are placed near the leading edge and model the vortices induced by miniature vortex generators (MVGs), which consist in a spanwise-periodic array of small winglet pairs. The introduction of MVGs has been experimentally proved to be a successful passive flow control strategy for delaying laminar-turbulent transition caused by Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) waves. The counter-rotating vortex pairs induce non-modal, transient growth that leads to a streaky boundary layer flow. The initial intensity of the vortices and their wall-normal distances to the plate wall are varied with the aim of finding the most effective location for streak generation and the effect on the instability characteristics of the perturbed flow. The study includes the solution of the three-dimensional, stationary, streaky boundary layer flows by using the boundary region equations, and the three-dimensional instability analysis of the resulting basic flows by using the plane-marching parabolized stability equations. Depending on the initial circulation and positioning of the vortices, planar TS waves are stabilized by the presence of the streaks, resulting in a reduction in the region of instability and shrink of the neutral stability curve. For a fixed maximum streak amplitude below the threshold for secondary instability (SI), the most effective wall-normal distance for the formation of the streaks is found to also offer the most stabilization of TS waves. By setting a maximum streak amplitude above the threshold for SI, sinuous shear layer modes become unstable, as well as another instability mode that is amplified in a narrow region near the vortex inlet position."

abstract,"Abstract The ability to manipulate and control fluid flows is of great importance in many scientific and engineering applications. The proposed closed-loop control framework addresses a key issue of model-based control: The actuation effect often results from slow dynamics of strongly nonlinear interactions which the flow reveals at timescales much longer than the prediction horizon of any model. Hence, we employ a probabilistic approach based on a cluster-based discretization of the Liouville equation for the evolution of the probability distribution. The proposed methodology frames high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics into low-dimensional, probabilistic, linear dynamics which considerably simplifies the optimal control problem while preserving nonlinear actuation mechanisms. The data-driven approach builds upon a state space discretization using a clustering algorithm which groups kinematically similar flow states into a low number of clusters. The temporal evolution of the probability distribution on this set of clusters is then described by a control-dependent Markov model. This Markov model can be used as predictor for the ergodic probability distribution for a particular control law. This probability distribution approximates the long-term behavior of the original system on which basis the optimal control law is determined. We examine how the approach can be used to improve the open-loop actuation in a separating flow dominated by Kelvin–Helmholtz shedding. For this purpose, the feature space, in which the model is learned, and the admissible control inputs are tailored to strongly oscillatory flows."

abstract,"Abstract Numerical simulation and theoretical analysis were performed to investigate the upstream topology of a jet–crossflow interaction. The numerical results were validated with mathematical theory as well as a juncture flow structure. The upstream critical point satisfies the condition of occurrence for a saddle point of attachment in the horseshoe vortex system. In addition to the classical topology led by a saddle point of separation, a new topology led by a saddle point of attachment was found for the first time in a jet–crossflow interaction. The degeneration of the critical point from separation to attachment is determined by the velocity ratio of the jet over the crossflow, and the boundary layer thickness of the flat plate. When the boundary layer thickness at the upstream edge of the jet is close to one diameter of the jet, the flow topology is led by a saddle point of attachment. Variation of the velocity ratio does not change the topology but the location of the saddle point. When the boundary layer thickness is less than 0.255 of the jet flow diameter, large velocity ratio can generate a saddle point of attachment without spiral horseshoe vortex; continuously decreasing the velocity ratio will change the flow topology to saddle point of the separation. The degeneration of the critical point from attachment to separation was observed."

abstract,"Abstract Transition from steady to oscillatory buoyancy convection of air in a laterally heated cubic box is studied numerically by straight-forward time integration of Boussinesq equations using a series of gradually refined finite volume grids. Horizontal and spanwise cube boundaries are assumed to be either perfectly thermally conducting or perfectly thermally insulated, which results in four different sets of thermal boundary conditions. Critical Grashof numbers are obtained by interpolation of numerically extracted growth/decay rates of oscillation amplitude to zero. Slightly supercritical flow regimes are described by time-averaged flows, snapshots, and spatial distribution of the oscillation amplitude. Possible similarities and dissimilarities with two-dimensional instabilities in laterally heated square cavities are discussed. Break of symmetries and sub- or supercritical character of bifurcations are examined. Three consequent transitions from steady to the oscillatory regime, from the oscillatory to the steady regime, and finally to the oscillatory flow, are found in the case of perfectly insulated horizontal and spanwise boundaries. Arguments for grid and time-step independence of the results are given."

abstract,"Abstract Boundary layer flows over concave wall can be unstable to disturbances giving rise to streamwise counter-rotating vortices known as Görtler vortices. These vortices in its nonlinear form are responsible for a strong distortion of the streamwise velocity profiles in the wall-normal and spanwise directions. The resulting inflectional velocity profiles are unstable to unsteady disturbances. These disturbances are called secondary instabilities and can develop into horseshoe vortices or a sinuous motion of the Görtler vortices. These types of secondary instabilities are known as even (varicose) and odd (sinuous) modes, respectively. Although many studies focused this subject, it has not been stated which mode dominates the transition process. In the present study the secondary instability of Görtler flow is investigated using high-order spatial numerical simulation. Multi-frequency unsteady disturbances are introduced with the same spanwise wavelength as the Görtler vortices, but different spanwise phases. Three different spanwise phases are used and the effect on the secondary instability is analyzed. Both, even and odd secondary instabilities are observed, according to the relative spanwise position of the unsteady disturbances. The growth analysis for each secondary crossplane instability mode is made using a temporal Fourier analysis and the physics is explored with the aid of the flow structures visualization. The results introducing disturbances that give rise to odd and even modes simultaneously show that, for the spanwise wavelength analyzed, the odd modes grow first and dominate the transition process."

The flow was simulated at a jet Reynolds number of 1000 (based on \(\Delta R\) and the jet velocity), \(\frac{L}{\Delta R} \) in the range 1–20, and \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\) in the range 0.05–0.25. Five characteristic flow evolution patterns were observed and classified based on \(\frac{L}{\Delta R} \) and \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\). The results showed that the relative position, relative strength, and radii of the vortex rings during and soon after formation played a prominent role in the evolution of the trajectories of their vorticity centroids at the later time. The conditions on relative strength of the vortices necessary for them to travel together as a pair following formation were studied, and factors affecting differences in vortex circulation following formation were investigated. In addition to the characteristics of the primary vortices, the stopping vortices had a strong influence on the initial vortex configuration and effected the long-time flow evolution at low \(\frac{L}{\Delta R}\) and small \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\). For long \(\frac{L}{\Delta R} \) and small \(\frac{\Delta R}{R}\), shedding of vorticity was sometimes observed and this shedding was related to the Kelvin–Benjamin variational principle of maximal energy for steadily translating vortex rings."

abstract,"Abstract The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)—a popular method for performing data-driven Koopman spectral analysis—has gained increased popularity for extracting dynamically meaningful spatiotemporal descriptions of fluid flows from snapshot measurements. Often times, DMD descriptions can be used for predictive purposes as well, which enables informed decision-making based on DMD model forecasts. Despite its widespread use and utility, DMD can fail to yield accurate dynamical descriptions when the measured snapshot data are imprecise due to, e.g., sensor noise. Here, we express DMD as a two-stage algorithm in order to isolate a source of systematic error. We show that DMD’s first stage, a subspace projection step, systematically introduces bias errors by processing snapshots asymmetrically. To remove this systematic error, we propose utilizing an augmented snapshot matrix in a subspace projection step, as in problems of total least-squares, in order to account for the error present in all snapshots. The resulting unbiased and noise-aware total DMD (TDMD) formulation reduces to standard DMD in the absence of snapshot errors, while the two-stage perspective generalizes the de-biasing framework to other related methods as well. TDMD’s performance is demonstrated in numerical and experimental fluids examples. In particular, in the analysis of time-resolved particle image velocimetry data for a separated flow, TDMD outperforms standard DMD by providing dynamical interpretations that are consistent with alternative analysis techniques. Further, TDMD extracts modes that reveal detailed spatial structures missed by standard DMD."

abstract,"Abstract The motion of a heavy finite-size tracer is numerically calculated in a two-dimensional shear-driven cavity. The particle motion is computed using a discontinuous Galerkin-finite-element method combined with a smoothed profile method resolving all scales, including the flow in the lubrication gap between the particle and the boundary. The centrifugation of heavy particles in the recirculating flow is counteracted by a repulsion from the shear-stress surface. The resulting limit cycle for the particle motion represents an attractor for particles in dilute suspensions. The limit cycles obtained by fully resolved simulations as a function of the particle size and density are compared with those obtained by one-way coupling using the Maxey–Riley equation and an inelastic collision model for the particle–boundary interaction, solely characterized by an interaction-length parameter. It is shown that the one-way coupling approach can faithfully approximate the true limit cycle if the interaction length is selected depending on the particle size and its relative density."

abstract,"Abstract The stability of the conduction regime of natural convection in a porous vertical slab saturated with an Oldroyd-B fluid has been studied. A modified Darcy’s law is utilized to describe the flow in a porous medium. The eigenvalue problem is solved using Chebyshev collocation method and the critical Darcy–Rayleigh number with respect to the wave number is extracted for different values of physical parameters. Despite the basic state being the same for Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, it is observed that the basic flow is unstable for viscoelastic fluids—a result of contrast compared to Newtonian as well as for power-law fluids. It is found that the viscoelasticity parameters exhibit both stabilizing and destabilizing influence on the system. Increase in the value of strain retardation parameter \(\Lambda _2 \) portrays stabilizing influence on the system while increasing stress relaxation parameter \(\Lambda _1\) displays an opposite trend. Also, the effect of increasing ratio of heat capacities is to delay the onset of instability. The results for Maxwell fluid obtained as a particular case from the present study indicate that the system is more unstable compared to Oldroyd-B fluid."

In order to characterize such forces, a numerical model is developed in this study and is validated using analytical expressions of pressure as a function of the speed of sound-wave propagation in water. The computational results not only accurately match the analytical values but are also able to effectively capture the propagation of acoustic waves in water. The model is further applied to a case study wherein the impact impulse required by the basilisk lizard to assist in its walking on the water surface is evaluated. The numerical results are found to be in agreement with the closest available experimental data. The model and approach are thus proposed to evaluate impact forces for wide range of applications."

abstract,"Abstract An analysis of pressure-gradient-driven flows in channels with walls modified by transverse ribs has been carried out. The ribs have been introduced intentionally in order to generate streamwise vortices through centrifugally driven instabilities. The cost of their introduction, i.e. the additional pressure losses, have been determined. Linear stability theory has been used to determine conditions required for the formation of the vortices. It has been demonstrated that there exists a finite range of rib wave numbers capable of creating vortices. Within this range, there exists an optimal wave number which results in the minimum critical Reynolds number for the specified rib amplitude. The optimal wave numbers marginally depend on the rib positions and amplitudes. As the formation of the vortices can be interfered with by viscosity-driven instabilities, the critical conditions for the onset of such instabilities have also been determined. The rib geometries which result in the vortex formation with the smallest drag penalty and without interference from the viscosity-driven instabilities have been identified."

abstract,"Abstract We report the findings from a theoretical analysis of optimally growing disturbances in an initially turbulent boundary layer. The motivation behind this study originates from the desire to generate organized structures in an initially turbulent boundary layer via excitation by disturbances that are tailored to be preferentially amplified. Such optimally growing disturbances are of interest for implementation in an active flow control strategy that is investigated for effective jet noise control. Details of the optimal perturbation theory implemented in this study are discussed. The relevant stability equations are derived using both the standard decomposition and the triple decomposition. The chosen test case geometry contains a convergent nozzle, which generates a Mach 0.9 round jet, preceded by a circular pipe. Optimally growing disturbances are introduced at various stations within the circular pipe section to facilitate disturbance energy amplification upstream of the favorable pressure gradient zone within the convergent nozzle, which has a stabilizing effect on disturbance growth. Effects of temporal frequency, disturbance input and output plane locations as well as separation distance between output and input planes are investigated. The results indicate that optimally growing disturbances appear in the form of longitudinal counter-rotating vortex pairs, whose size can be on the order of several times the input plane mean boundary layer thickness. The azimuthal wavenumber, which represents the number of counter-rotating vortex pairs, is found to generally decrease with increasing separation distance. Compared to the standard decomposition, the triple decomposition analysis generally predicts relatively lower azimuthal wavenumbers and significantly reduced energy amplification ratios for the optimal disturbances."

abstract,"Abstract The presence of a finite tangential velocity on a hydrodynamically slipping surface is known to reduce vorticity production in bluff body flows substantially while at the same time enhancing its convection downstream and into the wake. Here, we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic slippage on the convective heat transfer (scalar transport) from a heated isothermal circular cylinder placed in a uniform cross-flow of an incompressible fluid through analytical and simulation techniques. At low Reynolds (\({\textit{Re}}\ll 1\)) and high Péclet (\({\textit{Pe}}\gg 1\)) numbers, our theoretical analysis based on Oseen and thermal boundary layer equations allows for an explicit determination of the dependence of the thermal transport on the non-dimensional slip length \(l_s\). In this case, the surface-averaged Nusselt number, Nu transitions gradually between the asymptotic limits of \(Nu \sim {\textit{Pe}}^{1/3}\) and \(Nu \sim {\textit{Pe}}^{1/2}\) for no-slip (\(l_s \rightarrow 0\)) and shear-free (\(l_s \rightarrow \infty \)) boundaries, respectively. Boundary layer analysis also shows that the scaling \(Nu \sim {\textit{Pe}}^{1/2}\) holds for a shear-free cylinder surface in the asymptotic limit of \({\textit{Re}}\gg 1\) so that the corresponding heat transfer rate becomes independent of the fluid viscosity. At finite \({\textit{Re}}\), results from our two-dimensional simulations confirm the scaling \(Nu \sim {\textit{Pe}}^{1/2}\) for a shear-free boundary over the range \(0.1 \le {\textit{Re}}\le 10^3\) and \(0.1\le {\textit{Pr}}\le 10\). A gradual transition from the lower asymptotic limit corresponding to a no-slip surface, to the upper limit for a shear-free boundary, with \(l_s\), is observed in both the maximum slip velocity and the Nu. The local time-averaged Nusselt number \(Nu_{\theta }\) for a shear-free surface exceeds the one for a no-slip surface all along the cylinder boundary except over the downstream portion where unsteady separation and flow reversal lead to an appreciable rise in the local heat transfer rates, especially at high \({\textit{Re}}\) and Pr. At a Reynolds number of \(10^3\), the formation of secondary recirculating eddy pairs results in appearance of additional local maxima in \(Nu_{\theta }\) at locations that are in close proximity to the mean secondary stagnation points. As a consequence, Nu exhibits a non-monotonic variation with \(l_s\) increasing initially from its lowermost value for a no-slip surface and then decreasing before rising gradually toward the upper asymptotic limit for a shear-free cylinder. A non-monotonic dependence of the spanwise-averaged Nu on \(l_s\) is observed in three dimensions as well with the three-dimensional wake instabilities that appear at sufficiently low \(l_s\), strongly influencing the convective thermal transport from the cylinder. The analogy between heat transfer and single-component mass transfer implies that our results can directly be applied to determine the dependency of convective mass transfer of a single solute on hydrodynamic slip length in similar configurations through straightforward replacement of Nu and \({\textit{Pr}}\) with Sherwood and Schmidt numbers, respectively."

abstract,"Abstract The flow over two square cylinders in staggered arrangement is simulated numerically at a fixed Reynolds number (\(Re =150\)) for different gap spacing between cylinders from 0.1 to 6 times a cylinder side to understand the flow structures. The non-inclined square cylinders are located on a line with a staggered angle of \(45^{\circ }\) to the oncoming velocity vector. All numerical simulations are carried out with a finite-volume code based on a collocated grid arrangement. The effects of vortex shedding on the various features of the flow field are numerically visualized using different flow contours such as \(\lambda _{2}\) criterion, vorticity, pressure and magnitudes of velocity to distinguish the distinctive flow patterns. By changing the gap spacing between cylinders, five different flow regimes are identified and classified as single body, periodic gap flow, aperiodic, modulated periodic and synchronized vortex shedding regimes. This study revealed that the observed multiple frequencies in global forces of the downstream cylinder in the modulated periodic regime are more properly associated with differences in vortex shedding frequencies of individual cylinders than individual shear layers reported in some previous works; particularly, both shear layers from the downstream cylinder often shed vortices at the same multiple frequencies. The maximum Strouhal number for the upstream cylinder is also identified at \({G}^{*}=1\) for aperiodic flow pattern. Furthermore, for most cases studied, the downstream cylinder experiences larger drag force than the upstream cylinder."

abstract,"Abstract The appearance of a ground surface can play an important role in the flow structures for the flows past a flat plate. We conduct two-dimensional numerical simulations on viscous flows past a flat plate inclined at an angle of attack of \(20^\circ \) with ground effects using a finite-volume method. Results  show that the effects on the separated flow from the ground are highly dependent on the gap (G) between the plate and the ground. As the gap decreases, the strength of vortices generated from the trailing edge is restrained, which is consistent with experimental observations. Further decrease in the gap even eliminates the vortex shedding and yields a steady flow. It is also found that the flow between the gap can either be accelerated at large gap ratios (\({G/L >1}\), G is the gap, L is the plate length), or be decelerated at small gap ratios (\({G/L <1}\)). Furthermore, the numerical results show that the wake flow behind the plate can significantly change the distribution of surface shear stress on the ground. Specifically, the mean shear stress on the ground in the downstream region at a gap ratio \(G/L = 2.0\) is one order of magnitude larger than that at a small gap ratio \(G/L = 0.3\), and the length of the downstream region where the shear stress can be effectively changed is much larger than the plate length, which provides a guideline to manipulate the ground wall surface shear stress using an inclined plate in the vicinity of the wall."

abstract,"Abstract This study aims to investigate effective slip arising from pressure-driven flow through a slit channel bounded by lubricant-impregnated grooved surfaces. The problem for flow over longitudinal grooves is solved analytically using the methods of domain decomposition and eigenfunction expansion, while that for flow over transverse grooves is solved numerically using the front tracking method. It is found that the effective slip length and the lubricant flow rate can depend strongly on the geometry of the microstructure, the direction of flow, and the lubricant viscosity. In particular, the effective slip can be effectively enhanced by increasing the thickness of a lubricating film atop the ribs. Under the same conditions, a flow that is parallel to the lubricant-impregnated grooves will have a larger effective slip, but also a larger lubricant flow rate, when compared with the case of flow normal to the grooves. It is also shown that, in the case of transverse grooves, because of the downward displacement of the interface between the working/lubricating fluids, the effective slip length and lubricant flow rate may vary non-monotonically with the groove depth."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a two-dimensional numerical study for mixed convection in a laminar cross-flow with a pair of stationary equal-sized isothermal cylinders in tandem arrangement confined in a channel. The governing equations are solved using the control volume method on a nonuniform orthogonal Cartesian grid, and the immersed boundary method is employed to identify the cylinders placed in the flow field. The numerical scheme is first validated against standard cases of symmetrically confined isothermal circular cylinders in plane channels, and grid convergence tests were also examined. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of buoyancy and the blockage ratio constraint on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the immersed cylinder array. Using a fixed Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter of \(Re_{D} = 200\), a fixed value of the Prandtl number of \(Pr = 7\), and a blockage ratio of \(D/H = 0.2\), all possible flow regimes are considered by setting the longitudinal spacing ratio (\(\sigma = L/D\)) between the cylinder axes to 2, 3, and 5 for values of the buoyancy parameter (Richardson number) in the range \(-1\le Ri\le 4\). The interference effects and complex flow features are presented in the form of mean and instantaneous velocity, vorticity, and temperature distributions. The results demonstrate how the buoyancy, spacing ratio, and wall confinement affect the wake structure and vortex dynamics. In addition, local and average heat transfer characteristics of both cylinders are comprehensively presented for a wide range in the parametric space."

abstract,"Abstract We present a low-dimensional Galerkin model with state-dependent modes capturing linear and nonlinear dynamics. Departure point is a direct numerical simulation of the three-dimensional incompressible flow around a sphere at Reynolds numbers 400. This solution starts near the unstable steady Navier–Stokes solution and converges to a periodic limit cycle. The investigated Galerkin models are based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and derive the dynamical system from first principles, the Navier–Stokes equations. A DMD model with training data from the initial linear transient fails to predict the limit cycle. Conversely, a model from limit-cycle data underpredicts the initial growth rate roughly by a factor 5. Key enablers for uniform accuracy throughout the transient are a continuous mode interpolation between both oscillatory fluctuations and the addition of a shift mode. This interpolated model is shown to capture both the transient growth of the oscillation and the limit cycle."

abstract,"Abstract This article addresses a classical fluid mechanics problem where the effect of capillary action on a column of viscous liquid is analyzed by quantifying its time-dependent penetrated length in a narrow channel. Despite several past studies, a rigorous mathematical formulation of this inherently unsteady process is still unavailable, because these existing works resort to a crucial assumption only valid for mildly transient systems. The approximate theories use an integral approach where the penetration is described by equating total force acting on the domain to rate of change of total momentum. However, while doing so, the viscous resistance under temporally varying condition is assumed to be same as the resistance created by a quasi-steady velocity profile. Thus, leading order error appears due to such approximation which can only be true when the variation in time is not strong enough causing negligible transient deviation in the hydrodynamic quantities. The present paper proposes a new way to solve this problem by considering the unsteady field itself as an unknown variable. Accordingly, the analysis applies an eigenfunction expansion of the flow with unknown time-dependent amplitudes which along with the unsteady intrusion length are calculated from a system of ordinary differential equations. A comparative exploration identifies the situation for which the integral approach and the rigorous technique based on eigenfunction expansion deviate from each other. It also reveals that the two methods differ substantially in short-time dynamics at the initial stage. Then, an asymptotic perturbation shows how the two sets of results should coincide in their long-time behavior. In this way, the findings will provide a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind the transport phenomenon."

abstract,"Abstract Idealized models of reduced complexity are important tools to understand key processes underlying a complex system. In climate science in particular, they are important for helping the community improve our ability to predict the effect of climate change on the earth system. Climate models are large computer codes based on the discretization of the fluid dynamics equations on grids of horizontal resolution in the order of 100 km, whereas unresolved processes are handled by subgrid models. For instance, simple models are routinely used to help understand the interactions between small-scale processes due to atmospheric moist convection and large-scale circulation patterns. Here, a zonally symmetric model for the monsoon circulation is presented and solved numerically. The model is based on the Galerkin projection of the primitive equations of atmospheric synoptic dynamics onto the first modes of vertical structure to represent free tropospheric circulation and is coupled to a bulk atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) model. The model carries bulk equations for water vapor in both the free troposphere and the ABL, while the processes of convection and precipitation are represented through a stochastic model for clouds. The model equations are coupled through advective nonlinearities, and the resulting system is not conservative and not necessarily hyperbolic. This makes the design of a numerical method for the solution of this system particularly difficult. Here, we develop a numerical scheme based on the operator time-splitting strategy, which decomposes the system into three pieces: a conservative part and two purely advective parts, each of which is solved iteratively using an appropriate method. The conservative system is solved via a central scheme, which does not require hyperbolicity since it avoids the Riemann problem by design. One of the advective parts is a hyperbolic diagonal matrix, which is easily handled by classical methods for hyperbolic equations, while the other advective part is a nilpotent matrix, which is solved via the method of lines. Validation tests using a synthetic exact solution are presented, and formal second-order convergence under grid refinement is demonstrated. Moreover, the model is tested under realistic monsoon conditions, and the ability of the model to simulate key features of the monsoon circulation is illustrated in two distinct parameter regimes."

abstract,"Abstract Leading-edge modifications based on designs inspired by the protrusions on the pectoral flippers of the humpback whale (tubercles) have been the subject of research for the past decade primarily due to their flow control potential in ameliorating stall characteristics. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in the transitional flow regime, full-span wings with tubercled leading edges outperform unmodified wings at high attack angles. The flow mechanism associated with such enhanced loading traits is, however, still being investigated. Also, the performance of full-span tubercled wings in the turbulent regime is largely unexplored. The present study aims to investigate Reynolds number effects on the flow mechanism induced by a full-span tubercled wing with the NACA-0021 cross-sectional profile in the transitional and near-turbulent regimes using computational fluid dynamics. The analysis of the flow field suggests that, with the exception of a few different flow features, the same underlying flow mechanism, involving the presence of transverse and streamwise vorticity, is at play in both cases. With regard to lift-generation characteristics, the numerical simulation results indicate that in contrast to the transitional flow regime, where the unmodified NACA-0021 undergoes a sudden loss of lift, in the turbulent regime, the baseline foil experiences gradual stall and produces more lift than the tubercled foil. This observation highlights the importance of considerations regarding the Reynolds number effects and the stall characteristics of the baseline foil, in the industrial applications of tubercled lifting bodies."

abstract,"Abstract The dynamics of oblique shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interactions is analyzed by mining a large-eddy simulation (LES) database for various strengths of the incoming shock. The flow dynamics is first analyzed by means of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which highlights the simultaneous occurrence of two types of flow modes, namely a low-frequency type associated with breathing motion of the separation bubble, accompanied by flapping motion of the reflected shock, and a high-frequency type associated with the propagation of instability waves past the interaction zone. Global linear stability analysis performed on the mean LES flow fields yields a single unstable zero-frequency mode, plus a variety of marginally stable low-frequency modes whose stability margin decreases with the strength of the interaction. The least stable linear modes are grouped into two classes, one of which bears striking resemblance to the breathing mode recovered from DMD and another class associated with revolving motion within the separation bubble. The results of the modal and linear stability analysis support the notion that low-frequency dynamics is intrinsic to the interaction zone, but some continuous forcing from the upstream boundary layer may be required to keep the system near a limit cycle. This can be modeled as a weakly damped oscillator with forcing, as in the early empirical model by Plotkin (AIAA J 13:1036–1040, 1975)."

abstract,"Abstract A combined theoretical and numerical analysis of an experiment devoted to the excitation of Görtler vortices by localized stationary or vibrating surface nonuniformities in a boundary layer over a concave surface is performed. A numerical model of generation of small-amplitude disturbances and their downstream propagation based on parabolic equations is developed. In the framework of this model, the optimal and the modal parts of excited disturbance are defined as solutions of initial-value problems with initial values being, respectively, the optimal disturbance and the leading local mode at the location of the source. It is shown that a representation of excited disturbance as a sum of the optimal part and a remainder makes it possible to describe its generation and downstream propagation, as well as to predict satisfactorily the corresponding receptivity coefficient. In contrast, the representation based on the modal part provides only coarse information about excitation and propagation of disturbance in the range of parameters under investigation. However, it is found that the receptivity coefficients estimated using the modal parts can be reinterpreted to preserve their practical significance. A corresponding procedure was developed. The theoretical and experimental receptivity coefficients are estimated and compared. It is found that the receptivity magnitudes grow significantly with the disturbance frequency. Variation of the span-wise scale of the nonuniformities affects weakly the receptivity characteristics at zero frequency. However, at high frequencies, the efficiency of excitation of Görtler vortices depends substantially on the span-wise scale."

The SFML is used as a test case in which the efficacy of the model closure for the physical-space transport of the fluid velocity field can be tested in a flow with inhomogeneity, without the additional complexity of mean-flow coupling. The model is able to capture certain features of the SFML quite well for intermediate to long times, including the evolution of the mixing-layer width and turbulent kinetic energy. At short-times, and for more sensitive statistics such as the generation of the velocity field anisotropy, the model is less accurate. We propose two possible causes for the discrepancies. The first is the local approximation to the pressure-transport and the second is the a priori spherical averaging used to reduce the dimensionality of the solution space of the model, from wavevector to wavenumber space. DNS data are then used to gauge the relative importance of both possible deficiencies in the model."

In the present study, a simple and novel length scale combining the wall distance and the von Karman length scale is proposed by introducing a structural function. The new length scale becomes the von Karman length scale once local unsteady structures are detected. The proposed method is adopted in a series of turbulent channel flows at different Reynolds numbers. The results show that the proposed length scale with the structural function can precisely simulate turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, even with a coarse grid resolution."

abstract,"Abstract We study the drift induced by the passage of two cylinders through an unbounded extent of inviscid incompressible fluid under the assumption that the flow is two dimensional and steady in the moving frame of reference. The goal is to assess how the resulting total particle drift depends on the parameters of the geometric configuration, namely the distance between the cylinders and their angle with respect to the direction of translation. This problem is studied by numerically computing, for different cylinder configurations, the trajectories of particles starting at various initial locations. The velocity field used in these computations is expressed in closed form using methods of the complex function theory, and the accuracy of calculations is carefully verified. We identify cylinder configurations which result in increased and decreased drift with respect to the reference case when the two cylinders are separated by an infinite distance. Particle trajectories shed additional light on the hydrodynamic interactions between the cylinders in configurations resulting in different drift values. This ensemble of results provides insights about the accuracy of models used to study biogenic transport."

abstract,"Abstract In this study, the melting process of ice as a phase-change material (PCM) saturated with a nickel–steel porous matrix inside a horizontal elliptical tube is investigated. Due to the low thermal conductivity of the PCM, it is motivated to augment the heat transfer performance of the system simultaneously by finding an optimum value of the aspect ratio and impregnating a metallic porous matrix into the base PCM. The lattice Boltzmann method with a double distribution function formulated based on the enthalpy method, is applied at the representative elementary volume scale under the local thermal equilibrium assumption between the PCM and porous matrix in the composite. While reducing or increasing the aspect ratio of the circular tubes leads to the expedited melting, the 90\(^{\circ }\) inclination of each elliptical tube in the case of the pure PCM melting does not affect the melting rate. With the reduction in the porosity, the effective thermal conductivity and melting rate in all tubes promoted. Although the natural convection is fully suppressed due to the significant flow blockage in the porous structure, the melting rates are generally increased in all cases."

abstract,"Abstract An exegesis of a novel mechanism leading to vortex splitting and subsequent shedding that is valid for two-dimensional incompressible, inviscid or viscous, and external or internal or wall-bounded flows, is detailed in this research. The mechanism, termed the vortex shedding mechanism (VSM) is simple and intuitive, requiring only two coincident conditions in the flow: (1) the existence of a location with zero momentum and (2) the presence of a net force having a positive divergence. Numerical solutions of several model problems illustrate causality of the VSM. Moreover, the VSM criteria is proved to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a vortex splitting event in any two-dimensional, incompressible flow. The VSM is shown to exist in several canonical problems including the external flow past a circular cylinder. Suppression of the von Kármán vortex street is demonstrated for Reynolds numbers of 100 and 400 by mitigating the VSM."

This method is designed for experimental configurations, requiring no computations nor prior knowledge of the system, and enjoys intrinsic robustness. It is illustrated on two systems: the control of the transitions of a Lorenz’63 dynamical system, and the control of the drag of a cylinder flow. The method is shown to perform well."

Mean flow for stability analysis is obtained by solving the parabolized Navier–Stokes equations. Hump with height smaller than local boundary layer thickness is considered. The case of flat plate and sharp cone without the hump are also studied to provide comparable data. For flat plate boundary layers, destabilization and stabilization effect is confirmed for hump located at upstream and downstream of synchronization point, respectively. Results  of parametric studies to examine the effect of hump height, location, etc., are also given. For sharp cone boundary layer, stabilization influence of hump is also identified for a specific range of frequency. Stabilization influence of hump on convective instability of mode S is found to be a possible cause of previous experimental observations of delaying transition in hypersonic boundary layers."

abstract,"Abstract Canonical problems involving single, pairs, and arrays of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are investigated numerically with the objective of understanding the underlying flow structures and their implications on energy production. Experimental studies by Dabiri (J Renew Sustain Energy 3, 2011) suggest that VAWTs demand less stringent spacing requirements than their horizontal axis counterparts and additional benefits may be obtained by optimizing the placement and rotational direction of VAWTs. The flowfield of pairs of co-/counter-rotating VAWTs shows some similarities with pairs of cylinders in terms of wake structure and vortex shedding. When multiple VAWTs are placed in a column, the extent of the wake is seen to spread further downstream, irrespective of the direction of rotation of individual turbines. However, the aerodynamic interference between turbines gives rise to regions of excess momentum between the turbines which lead to significant power augmentations. Studies of VAWTs arranged in multiple columns show that the downstream columns can actually be more efficient than the leading column, a proposition that could lead to radical improvements in wind farm productivity."

abstract,"Abstract This numerical study describes the eddy emergence and transformations in a slow steady axisymmetric air–water flow, driven by a rotating top disk in a vertical conical container. As water height \(H_{\mathrm{w}}\) and cone half-angle \(\beta \) vary, numerous flow metamorphoses occur. They are investigated for \(\beta =30^{\circ }, 45^{\circ }\), and \(60^{\circ }\). For small \(H_{\mathrm{w}}\), the air flow is multi-cellular with clockwise meridional circulation near the disk. The air flow becomes one cellular as \(H_{\mathrm{w}}\) exceeds a threshold depending on \(\beta \). For all \(\beta \), the water flow has an unbounded number of eddies whose size and strength diminish as the cone apex is approached. As the water level becomes close to the disk, the outmost water eddy with clockwise meridional circulation expands, reaches the interface, and induces a thin layer with anticlockwise circulation in the air. Then this layer expands and occupies the entire air domain. The physical reasons for the flow transformations are provided. The results are of fundamental interest and can be relevant for aerial bioreactors."

abstract,"Abstract Model-based feedback control of vortex shedding at low Reynolds numbers is considered. The feedback signal is provided by velocity measurements in the wake, and actuation is achieved using blowing and suction on the cylinder’s surface.

These models are used to design feedback controllers using \(\mathcal {H}_\infty \) loop-shaping. Complete suppression of shedding is demonstrated up to Re \(=\) 110—both for a single-sensor arrangement and for a three-sensor arrangement. The robustness of the feedback controllers is also investigated by applying them over a range of off-design Reynolds numbers, and good robustness properties are seen. It is also observed that it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve acceptable control performance—measured in a suitable way—as Reynolds number increases."

abstract,"Abstract Most computational fluid dynamics simulations are, at present, performed in a body-fixed frame, for aeronautical purposes. With the advent of sharp manoeuvre, which may lead to transient effects originating in the acceleration of the centre of mass, there is a need to have a consistent formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations in an arbitrarily moving frame. These expressions should be in a form that allows terms to be transformed between non-inertial and inertial frames and includes gravity, viscous terms, and linear and angular acceleration. Since no effects of body acceleration appear in the inertial frame Navier–Stokes equations themselves, but only in their boundary conditions, it is useful to investigate acceleration source terms in the non-inertial frame. In this paper, a derivation of the energy equation is provided in addition to the continuity and momentum equations previously published. Relevant dimensionless constants are derived which can be used to obtain an indication of the relative significance of acceleration effects. The necessity for using computational fluid dynamics to capture nonlinear effects remains, and various implementation schemes for accelerating bodies are discussed. This theoretical treatment is intended to provide a foundation for interpretation of aerodynamic effects observed in manoeuvre, particularly for accelerating missiles."

abstract,"Abstract The sudden impact of a free surface flow upon a solid wall is a common occurrence in many situations in nature and technology. The design of marine structures is probably the most obvious example, but also river and dam hydraulics as well as the necessity of understanding flood and debris flow-induced damage have led to theoretical and experimental work on the mechanism of fluid slamming loads. This is therefore a very old and rich research field, which has not yet reached full maturity, so that semi-empirical methods in design practice are still the rule in many sectors. Up-to-date CFD technology with both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches is employed to investigate highly non-stationary fluid impact on a solid wall. The development of the pressure wave produced by the impact is examined as it propagates and interacts with the fluid boundaries, as well as the subsequent build-up of high-pressure gradients of high fluid velocities. The geometry and the velocity field of the problem considered are very simple, but the results seem to provide new insight, in particular, into the connection between phenomena with different timescales."

abstract,"Abstract Many fluid flows of engineering interest, though very complex in appearance, can be approximated by low-order models governed by a few modes, able to capture the dominant behavior (dynamics) of the system. This feature has fueled the development of various methodologies aimed at extracting dominant coherent structures from the flow. Some of the more general techniques are based on data-driven decompositions, most of which rely on performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) on a formulated snapshot (data) matrix. The amount of experimentally or numerically generated data expands as more detailed experimental measurements and increased computational resources become readily available. Consequently, the data matrix to be processed will consist of far more rows than columns, resulting in a so-called tall-and-skinny (TS) matrix. Ultimately, the SVD of such a TS data matrix can no longer be performed on a single processor, and parallel algorithms are necessary. The present study employs the parallel TSQR algorithm of (Demmel et al. in SIAM J Sci Comput 34(1):206–239, 2012), which is further used as a basis of the underlying parallel SVD. This algorithm is shown to scale well on machines with a large number of processors and, therefore, allows the decomposition of very large datasets. In addition, the simplicity of its implementation and the minimum required communication makes it suitable for integration in existing numerical solvers and data decomposition techniques. Examples that demonstrate the capabilities of highly parallel data decomposition algorithms include transitional processes in compressible boundary layers without and with induced flow separation."

abstract,"Abstract Manipulation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability using an external electric field has been the subject of many studies. However, most of these studies are focused on early stages of the evolution. In this work, the long-term evolution of the instability is investigated, focusing on the forces acting on the interface between the two fluids. To this end, numerical simulations are carried out at various electric permittivity and conductivity ratios as well as electric field intensities using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. The electric field is applied in parallel to gravity to maintain unstable evolution. The results show that increasing top-to-bottom permittivity ratio increases the rising velocity of the bubble while hindering the spike descent. The opposite trend is observed for increasing top-to-bottom conductivity ratio. These effects are amplified at larger electric field intensities, resulting in narrower structures as the response to the excitation is non-uniform along the interface."

An alternative and more general way to compute the projections is proposed. The approach is based on the Chorin projection combined with a SIMPLE-like iteration. Compared to the previous methodology based on divergence-free Galerkin–Chebyshev bases, this technique, formulated in general curvilinear coordinates, is applicable to any flow region and allows for faster computations. To illustrate this visualization method, examples in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, as well as post-processing of experimental 3D-PTV data, are presented."

abstract,"Abstract Natural convection in a two-dimensional horizontal layer has been investigated. The layer is confined between two parallel horizontal plates. The upper plate is kept isothermal, while the lower plate has an externally imposed, long wavelength, spatially sinusoidal heating with the amplitude expressed in terms of the Rayleigh number Ra and the wavelength characterized by the wave number α. Only steady-state flow structures and their bifurcations have been considered. The detailed analysis has been carried out for two Prandtl numbers, i.e. Pr = 0.7 and Pr = 7, and only small differences in the bifurcation diagrams have been observed. When Ra < Ra cr = 427, convection has a simple topology consisting of one pair of counter-rotating rolls per heating period. Secondary motion in the form of rolls aligned in the direction of the primary rolls and concentrated around the hot spots occurs for Ra > 427. When 427 < Ra < ∼470 and α < ∼0.14, the secondary motion is described by the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. One of the branches of this bifurcation is associated with an odd number of secondary rolls per half wavelength, with rolls above the hot spots rotating in the direction opposite to the primary rolls. The other branch is associated with an even number of secondary rolls per half wavelength, with the rolls above the hot spots co-rotating with the primary rolls. The new rolls are pinched off in pairs when α decreases. When Ra > ∼470 and α > ~0.14, bifurcation assumes the form of “bifurcation from infinity”. The main branch is associated with one pair of rolls per heating period for α > 0.25. Decrease in α along this branch results in the formation of secondary rolls, with the rolls at the hot spot co-rotating with the primary rolls. The lower part of the other branch is associated with one pair of rolls per heating period in the limit α → 0. Increase in α results in pinching off a single roll which counter-rotates with respect to the primary roll at the hot spot."

abstract,"Abstract The effect of curved-boundary representation on the physics of the separated flow over a NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil is thoroughly investigated. A method is presented to approximate curved boundaries with a high-order discontinuous-Galerkin spectral element method for the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations. Multiblock quadrilateral element meshes are constructed with the grid generation software GridPro. The boundary of a NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil, defined by a cubic natural spline, is piecewise-approximated by isoparametric polynomial interpolants that represent the edges of boundary-fitted elements. Direct numerical simulation of the airfoil is performed on a coarse mesh and fine mesh with polynomial orders ranging from four to twelve. The accuracy of the curve fitting is investigated by comparing the flows computed on curved-sided meshes with those given by straight-sided meshes. Straight-sided meshes yield irregular wakes, whereas curved-sided meshes produce a regular Karman street wake. Straight-sided meshes also produce lower lift and higher viscous drag as compared with curved-sided meshes. When the mesh is refined by reducing the sizes of the elements, the lift decrease and viscous drag increase are less pronounced. The differences in the aerodynamic performance between the straight-sided meshes and the curved-sided meshes are concluded to be the result of artificial surface roughness introduced by the piecewise-linear boundary approximation provided by the straight-sided meshes."

Here we consider the post-collision flow dynamics, demonstrating that the equatorial jet serves to shed a finite amplitude toroidal vortex pair.

abstract,"Abstract A multidimensional computational fluid dynamic code was developed and integrated with probability density function combustion model to give the detailed account of multiphase fluid flow. The vapor phase within injector domain is treated with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes technique. A new parameter is proposed which is an index of plane-cut spray propagation and takes into account two parameters of spray penetration length and cone angle at the same time. It was found that spray propagation factor (SPI) tends to increase at lower r/d ratios, although the spray penetration tends to decrease. The results of SPI obtained by empirical correlation of Hay and Jones were compared with the simulation computation as a function of respective r/d ratio. Based on the results of this study, the spray distribution on plane area has proportional correlation with heat release amount, NO x  emission mass fraction, and soot concentration reduction. Higher cavitation is attributed to the sharp edge of nozzle entrance, yielding better liquid jet disintegration and smaller spray droplet that reduces soot mass fraction of late combustion process. In order to have better insight of cavitation phenomenon, turbulence magnitude in nozzle and combustion chamber was acquired and depicted along with spray velocity."

abstract,"Abstract In this research, the co-axial coalescence of a pair of gas bubbles rising in a viscous liquid column under the effects of an external uniform magnetic field is simulated numerically. Considered fluids are dielectric, and applied magnetic field is uniform. Effects of different strengths of magnetic field on the interaction of in-line rising bubbles and coalescence between them were investigated. For numerical modeling of the problem, a computer code was developed to solve the governing equations which are continuity, Navier–Stokes equation, magnetic field equation and level set and reinitialization of level set equations. The finite volume method is used for the discretization of the continuity and momentum equations using SIMPLE scheme where the finite difference method is used to discretization of the magnetic field equations. Also a level set method is used to capture the interface of two phases. The results are compared with available numerical and experimental results in the case of no-magnetic field effect which show a good agreement. It is found that uniform magnetic field accelerates the coalescence of the bubbles in dielectric fluids and enhances the rise velocity of the coalesced bubble."

abstract,"Abstract A three-dimensional unsteady theoretical model of droplet spreading process on an inclined surface is developed and numerically analyzed to investigate the droplet spreading dynamics via the lattice Boltzmann simulation. The contact line motion and morphology evolution for the droplet spreading on an inclined surface, which are, respectively, represented by the advancing/receding spreading factor and droplet wetted length, are evaluated and analyzed. The effects of surface wettability and inclination on the droplet spreading behaviors are examined. The results indicate that, dominated by gravity and capillarity, the droplet experiences a complex asymmetric deformation and sliding motion after the droplet comes into contact with the inclined surfaces. The droplet firstly deforms near the solid surface and mainly exhibits a radial expansion flow in the start-up stage. An evident sliding-down motion along the inclination is observed in the middle stage. And the surface-tension-driven retraction occurs during the retract stage. Increases in inclination angle and equilibrium contact angle lead to a faster droplet motion and a smaller wetted area. In addition, increases in equilibrium contact angle lead to a shorter duration time of the middle stage and an earlier entry into the retract stage."

The space–time structure of this component of the flow is then analyzed using POD and DMD in order to probe both the energetics and dynamics of the sound-producing flow skeleton. Both data processing techniques educe flapping and shedding modes and identify a nonlinear interaction between the two. POD shows the flapping mode to be energetically unimportant, while DMD highlights its dynamic importance. The difference mode—vortex shedding modulated by flapping of the separation bubble—is found to be the most acoustically important feature of the flow."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, the oscillation of two spark-generated bubbles placed on a vertical column in close proximity to a confined free surface is considered. The confined free surface is accorded by the top opening of different configurations. These configurations include (i) a centrally perforated horizontal flat plate (\({\theta=90^{\circ})}\), (ii) vertically placed cylinder (\({\theta=0^{\circ})}\) and (iii) nozzle (\({\theta >0^{\circ})}\). The main objective of the present work is to study the effects of key parameters such as the nozzle geometry, the locations of the energy input (i.e., initial position of the bubbles with respect to each other and relative to the free surface) on the dynamics of the two bubbles and the free surface. It was found that the lifetime of the upper bubble decreases from the vertical cylinder to the flat plate case. In addition, by reducing the inter-bubble distance, the lifetime of the upper bubble becomes longer and the repulsion between two bubbles during the expansion phase is stronger. Finally, by reducing the upper bubble-free surface distance, the repulsion between two bubbles during expansion phase increases, the tendency of the upper bubble to rebound and initiate another oscillation cycle decreases, and the amplitude of elevation of the free surface increases."

abstract,"Abstract We numerically investigate bouncing and non-bouncing of droplets during isothermal impact on superhydrophobic surfaces. An in-house, experimentally validated, finite element method-based computational model is employed to simulate the droplet impact dynamics and transient fluid flow within the droplet. The liquid–gas interface is tracked accurately in Lagrangian framework with dynamic wetting boundary condition at three-phase contact line. The interplay of kinetic, surface and gravitational energies is investigated via systematic variation of impact velocity and equilibrium contact angle. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the droplet bounces off the surface if the total droplet energy at the instance of maximum recoiling exceeds the initial surface and gravitational energy, otherwise not. The non-bouncing droplet is characterized by the oscillations on the free surface due to competition between the kinetic and surface energy. The droplet dimensions and shapes obtained at different times by the simulations are compared with the respective measurements available in the literature. Comparisons show good agreement of numerical data with measurements, and the computational model is able to reconstruct the bouncing and non-bouncing of the droplet as seen in the measurements. The simulated internal flow helps to understand the impact dynamics as well as the interplay of the associated energies during the bouncing and non-bouncing. A regime map is proposed to predict the bouncing and non-bouncing on a superhydrophobic surface with an equilibrium contact angle of 155°, using data of 86 simulations and the measurements available in the literature. We discuss the validity of the computational model for the wetting transition from Cassie to Wenzel state on micro- and nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces. We demonstrate that the numerical simulation can serve as an important tool to quantify the internal flow, if the simulated droplet shapes match the respective measurements utilizing high-speed photography."

abstract,"Abstract This work focuses on the comparison between Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood flows through a bileaflet mechanical heart valve in the aortic root. The blood, in fact, is a concentrated suspension of cells, mainly red blood cells, in a Newtonian matrix, the plasma, and consequently its overall behavior is that of a non-Newtonian fluid owing to the action of the cells’ membrane on the fluid part. The common practice, however, assumes the blood in large vessels as a Newtonian fluid since the shear rate is generally high and the effective viscosity becomes independent of the former. In this paper, we show that this is not always the case even in the aorta, the largest artery of the systemic circulation, owing to the pulsatile and transitional nature of the flow. Unexpectedly, for most of the pulsating cycle and in a large part of the fluid volume, the shear rate is smaller than the threshold level for the blood to display a constant effective viscosity and its shear thinning character might affect the system dynamics. A direct inspection of the various flow features has shown that the valve dynamics, the transvalvular pressure drop and the large-scale features of the flow are very similar for the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid models. On the other hand, the mechanical damage of the red blood cells (hemolysis), induced by the altered stress values in the flow, is larger for the non-Newtonian fluid model than for the Newtonian one."

abstract,"Abstract It has long been recognized that aortic root elasticity helps to ensure efficient aortic valve closure, but our understanding of the functional importance of the elasticity and geometry of the aortic root continues to evolve as increasingly detailed in vivo imaging data become available. Herein, we describe a fluid–structure interaction model of the aortic root, including the aortic valve leaflets, the sinuses of Valsalva, the aortic annulus, and the sinotubular junction, that employs a version of Peskin’s immersed boundary (IB) method with a finite element description of the structural elasticity. As in earlier work, we use a fiber-based model of the valve leaflets, but this study extends earlier IB models of the aortic root by employing an incompressible hyperelastic model of the mechanics of the sinuses and ascending aorta using a constitutive law fit to experimental data from human aortic root tissue. In vivo pressure loading is accounted for by a backward displacement method that determines the unloaded configuration of the root model. Our model yields realistic cardiac output at physiological pressures, with low transvalvular pressure differences during forward flow, minimal regurgitation during valve closure, and realistic pressure loads when the valve is closed during diastole. Further, results from high-resolution computations indicate that although the detailed leaflet and root kinematics show some grid sensitivity, our IB model of the aortic root nonetheless produces essentially grid-converged flow rates and pressures at practical grid spacings for the high Reynolds number flows of the aortic root. These results thereby clarify minimum grid resolutions required by such models when used as stand-alone models of the aortic valve as well as when used to provide models of the outflow valves in models of left-ventricular fluid dynamics."

The overall approach is applied to the study of a fluid–structure interaction problem, i.e., the hydrodynamics of swimming of an American eel, where the motion of the eel is derived from video imaging. It is shown that some first-blush approaches do not work, and therefore, careful consideration of appropriate techniques to connect moving images to flow simulations is necessary and forms the main contribution of the paper. A combination of level set-based active contour segmentation with optical flow and image morphing is shown to enable the image-to-computation process."

abstract,"Abstract The impact of surface trabeculae and papillary muscles on the hemodynamics of the left ventricle (LV) is investigated using numerical simulations. Simulations of ventricular flow are conducted for two different models of the LV derived from high-resolution cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans using an immersed boundary method-based flow solver. One model comprises a trabeculated left ventricle (TLV) that includes both trabeculae and papillary muscles, while the second model has a smooth left ventricle that is devoid of any of these surface features. Results  indicate that the trabeculae and papillary muscles significantly disrupt the vortices that develop during early filling in the TLV model. Large recirculation zones are found to form in the wake of the papillary muscles; these zones enhance the blockage provided by the papillary muscles and create a path for the mitral jet to penetrate deeper into the ventricular apex during diastole. During systole, the trabeculae enhance the apical washout by ‘squeezing’ the flow from the apical region. Finally, the trabeculae enhance viscous dissipation rate of the ventricular flow, but this effect is not significant in the overall power budget."

abstract,"Abstract Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical condition characterized by repetitive partial or complete occlusion of the airway during sleep. The soft tissues in the airway of OSA patients are prone to collapse under the low-pressure loads incurred during breathing. This paper describes efforts toward the development of a numerical tool for simulation of air–tissue interactions in the upper airway of patients with sleep apnea. A procedure by which patient-specific airway geometries are segmented and processed from dental cone-beam CT scans into signed distance fields is presented. A sharp-interface embedded boundary method based on the signed distance field is used on Cartesian grids for resolving the airflow in the airway geometries. For simulation of structure mechanics with large expected displacements, a cut-cell finite element method with nonlinear Green strains is used. The fluid and structure solvers are strongly coupled with a partitioned iterative algorithm. Preliminary results are shown for flow simulation inside the three-dimensional rigid upper airway of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Two validation cases for the fluid–structure coupling problem are also presented."

abstract,"Abstract Roughly one-third of all strokes are caused by an embolus traveling to a cerebral artery and blocking blood flow in the brain. The objective of this study is to gain a detailed understanding of the dynamics of embolic particles within arteries. Patient computed tomography image is used to construct a three-dimensional model of the carotid bifurcation. An idealized carotid bifurcation model of same vessel diameters was also constructed for comparison. Blood flow velocities and embolic particle trajectories are resolved using a coupled Euler–Lagrange approach. Blood is modeled as a Newtonian fluid, discretized using the finite volume method, with physiologically appropriate inflow and outflow boundary conditions. The embolus trajectory is modeled using Lagrangian particle equations accounting for embolus interaction with blood as well as vessel wall. Both one- and two-way fluid–particle coupling are considered, the latter being implemented using momentum sources augmented to the discretized flow equations. It was observed that for small-to-moderate particle sizes (relative to vessel diameters), the estimated particle distribution ratio—with and without the inclusion of two-way fluid–particle momentum exchange—were found to be similar. The maximum observed differences in distribution ratio with and without the coupling were found to be higher for the idealized bifurcation model. Additionally, the distribution was found to be reasonably matching the volumetric flow distribution for the idealized model, while a notable deviation from volumetric flow was observed in the anatomical model. It was also observed from an analysis of particle path lines that particle interaction with helical flow, characteristic of anatomical vasculature models, could play a prominent role in transport of embolic particle. The results indicate therefore that flow helicity could be an important hemodynamic indicator for analysis of embolus particle transport. Additionally, in the presence of helical flow, and vessel curvature, inclusion of two-way momentum exchange was found to have a secondary effect for transporting small to moderate embolus particles—and one-way coupling could be used as a reasonable approximation, thereby causing substantial savings in computational resources."

abstract,"Abstract Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease. Assessing the contribution of the valve as a portion to total ventricular load is essential for the aging population. A CT scan for one patient was used to create one in vivo tricuspid aortic valve geometry and assessed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulated the pressure, velocity, and flow rate, which were used to assess the Gorlin formula and continuity equation, current clinical diagnostic standards. The results demonstrate an underestimation of the anatomic orifice area (AOA) by Gorlin formula and overestimation of AOA by the continuity equation, using peak velocities, as would be measured clinically by Doppler echocardiography. As a result, we suggest that the Gorlin formula is unable to achieve the intended estimation of AOA and largely underestimates AOA at the critical low-flow states present in heart failure. The disparity in the use of echocardiography with the continuity equation is due to the variation in velocity profile between the outflow tract and the valve orifice. Comparison of time-averaged orifice areas by Gorlin and continuity with instantaneous orifice areas by planimetry can mask the errors of these methods, which is a result of the assumption that the blood flow is inviscid."

abstract,"Abstract Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital heart defect that has been associated with serious aortopathies, such as aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, calcific aortic valve and dilatation of ascending aorta. There are two main hypotheses to explain the increase prevalence of aortopathies in patients with BAV: the genetic and the hemodynamic. In this study, we seek to investigate the possible role of hemodynamic factors as causes of BAV-associated aortopathy. We employ the curvilinear immersed boundary method coupled with an efficient thin-shell finite-element formulation for tissues to carry out fluid–structure interaction simulations of a healthy trileaflet aortic valve (TAV) and a BAV placed in the same anatomic aorta. The computed results reveal major differences between the TAV and BAV flow patterns. These include: the dynamics of the aortic valve vortex ring formation and break up; the large-scale flow patterns in the ascending aorta; the shear stress magnitude, directions, and dynamics on the heart valve surfaces. The computed results are in qualitative agreement with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging data and suggest that the linkages between BAV aortopathy and hemodynamics deserve further investigation."

abstract,"Abstract This paper describes a procedure to synthesize Manufactured Solutions for Code Verification of an important class of Fluid–Structure Interaction (FSI) problems whose behaviors can be modeled as rigid body vibrations in incompressible fluids. We refer this class of FSI problems as Fluid–Solid Interaction problems, which can be found in many practical engineering applications. The methodology can be utilized to develop Manufactured Solutions for both 2-D and 3-D cases. We demonstrate the procedure with our numerical code. We present details of the formulation and methodology. We also provide the reasonings behind our proposed approach. Results  from grid and time step refinement studies confirm the verification of our solver and demonstrate the versatility of the simple synthesis procedure. In addition, the results also demonstrate that the modified decoupled approach to verify flow problems with high-order time-stepping schemes can be employed equally well to verify code for multi-physics problems (here, those of the Fluid–Solid Interaction) when the numerical discretization is based on the Method of Lines."

abstract,"Abstract Contact line phenomena govern a large number of multiphase flows. A reliable description of the contact line dynamics is therefore essential for prediction of such flows. Well-known difficulties of computation of the wetting phenomena include the mesh dependence of the results caused by flow singularity near the contact line and accurate estimation of its propagating velocity. The present study deals with the computational problem arising from the discontinuity in the dependence of the dynamic contact angle on the propagation velocity, associated with the contact angle hysteresis. The numerical simulations are performed using the volume of fluid method. The boundary conditions in the neighborhood of the contact line are switched depending on the value of the computed current local contact angle between a propagating contact line and a pinning condition. The method is applied to the simulation of the deformation and incipient motion of a shedding drop. The model is validated by comparison of the numerical predictions with experimental data."

abstract,"Abstract The paper outlines results of the theoretical study of an incompressible fluid flow in a rectangular microchannel subject to a sudden time-dependent pressure drop. The momentum equation together with the independent and dependent variables was reduced to a self-similar form by means of the symmetry analysis. The problem was solved using two analytical approaches, the Fourier method and the method of eigenfunction decomposition, as well as numerically by means of the lattice Boltzmann method. The unsteady two-dimensional velocity profiles in the microchannel were predicted using the infinite series and validated against the numerical solution. As expected, the flow pattern asymptotically attains the fully developed state, which is reached more rapidly for smaller Knudsen numbers. The analytical solution yielded expressions for the calculation of the hydraulic resistance coefficient."

abstract,"Abstract In this work, we derive a few new advective flux approximation expressions, apply them in a hybrid finite-volume-element (FVE) formulation, and solve the turbulent reacting flow governing equations in the cylindrical frame. To derive these advective-kinetic-based expressions, we benefit from the advantages of a physical influence scheme (PIS) basically, extend it to the cylindrical frame suitably, and approximate the required advective flux terms at the cell faces more accurately. The present numerical scheme not only respects the physics of flow correctly but also resolves the pressure–velocity coupling problem automatically. We also suggest a bi-implicit algorithm to solve the set of coupled turbulent reacting flow governing equations, in which the turbulence and chemistry governing equations are solved simultaneously. To evaluate the accuracy of new derived FVE–PIS expressions, we compare the current solutions with other available numerical solutions and experimental data. The comparisons show that the new derived expressions provide some more advantages over the past numerical approaches in solving turbulent diffusion flame in the cylindrical frame. Indeed, the current method and formulations can be used to solve and analyze the turbulent diffusion flames in the cylindrical coordinates very reliably."

abstract,"Abstract The flow pattern around a NACA0012 airfoil undergoing harmonic plunging motion corresponding to the deflected wake phenomenon reported by Jones and Platzer (Exp Fluids 46:799–810, 2009) is investigated in detail using direct numerical simulations. An arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation based on an unstructured side-centered finite volume method is utilized in order to solve the incompressible unsteady Navier–Stokes equations. The Reynolds number is chosen to be 252, and the reduced frequency of plunging motion (k = 2π fc/U ∞) and the plunge amplitude non-dimensionalized with respect to chord are set to be 12.3 and 0.12, respectively, as in the experimental study of Jones and Platzer (2009). The present numerical simulations reveal a highly persistent transient effect, and it takes two orders of magnitude larger duration than the heave period to reach the time-periodic state. In addition, the three-dimensional simulation reveals that the flow field is three-dimensional for the parameters used herein. The calculation reproduces the deflected wake and shows a good agreement with the experimental wake pattern. The instantaneous vorticity contours, finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields and particle traces are presented along with the aerodynamic parameters including the lift and thrust coefficients."

abstract,"Abstract In conventional Micro-Air-Vehicle design inspired by insects, the periodical motion of flapping airfoil usually leads to generation of a periodical aerodynamic force. However, recent studies indicate that time courses of aerodynamic force and flow structure of a flapping airfoil may be non-periodical even though the airfoil undergoes a periodical motion. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics analysis is employed to investigate the effects of some dimensionless variables, such as Reynolds number, plunging amplitude, advance ratio, and angle of attack, on the periodicity of the flow around a flapping airfoil. The governing equations in an inertial frame of reference are solved to obtain unsteady flow structure and aerodynamic behaviors of the airfoil. It is found in the results that the periodicity of the flow and aerodynamics is greatly dependent on Reynolds number and plunging amplitude. Under given conditions, the product of these two variables may be utilized as a criterion parameter to judge whether the time course of the flow is periodical or not. In addition, a new mechanism that accounts for the non-periodical flow is revealed to explain the flow of airfoil with pre-stall angle of attack."

abstract,"Abstract The instability mechanism of fully three-dimensional, highly separated, shear-driven confined flow inside a diagonally lid-driven cavity was investigated. The analysis was conducted on 1003 and 2003 stretched grids by a series of direct numerical simulations utilizing a standard second-order accuracy finite volume code, openFoam. The observed oscillatory instability was found to set in via a subcritical symmetry breaking Hopf bifurcation. Critical values of the Reynolds number Re cr = 2320 and the non-dimensional angular oscillating frequency \({\omega_{\rm cr}=0.249}\) for the transition from steady to oscillatory flow were accurately determined. An oscillatory regime of the bifurcated flow was analyzed in depth, revealing and characterizing the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism. Characteristic spatial patterns of the base flow and the main flow harmonic were determined for the velocity, vorticity and helicity fields. Lagrangian particle tracers were utilized to visualize the mixing phenomenon of the flow from both sides of the diagonal symmetry plane."

abstract,"Abstract Inexact hardware can reduce computational cost, due to a reduced energy demand and an increase in performance, and can therefore allow higher-resolution simulations of the atmosphere within the same budget for computation. We investigate the use of emulated inexact hardware for a model of the randomly forced 1D Burgers equation with stochastic sub-grid-scale parametrisation. Results  show that numerical precision can be reduced to only 12 bits in the significand of floating-point numbers—instead of 52 bits for double precision—with no serious degradation in results for all diagnostics considered. Simulations that use inexact hardware on a grid with higher spatial resolution show results that are significantly better compared to simulations in double precision on a coarser grid at similar estimated computing cost. In the second half of the paper, we compare the forcing due to rounding errors to the stochastic forcing of the stochastic parametrisation scheme that is used to represent sub-grid-scale variability in the standard model setup. We argue that stochastic forcings of stochastic parametrisation schemes can provide a first guess for the upper limit of the magnitude of rounding errors of inexact hardware that can be tolerated by model simulations and suggest that rounding errors can be hidden in the distribution of the stochastic forcing. We present an idealised model setup that replaces the expensive stochastic forcing of the stochastic parametrisation scheme with an engineered rounding error forcing and provides results of similar quality. The engineered rounding error forcing can be used to create a forecast ensemble of similar spread compared to an ensemble based on the stochastic forcing. We conclude that rounding errors are not necessarily degrading the quality of model simulations. Instead, they can be beneficial for the representation of sub-grid-scale variability."

abstract,"Abstract We consider a plane channel flow of an electrically conducting fluid which is driven by a mean pressure gradient in the presence of an applied magnetic field that is streamwise periodic with zero mean. Magnetic flux expulsion and the associated bifurcation in such a configuration are explored using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The structure of the flow and magnetic fields in the Hartmann regime (where the dominant balance is through Lorentz forces) and the Poiseuille regime (where viscous effects play a significant role) are studied, and detailed comparisons to the existing one-dimensional model of Kamkar and Moffatt (J Fluid Mech 90:107–122, 1982) are drawn to evaluate the validity of the model. Comparisons show good agreement of the model with DNS in the Hartmann regime, but significant differences arising in the Poiseuille regime when nonlinear effects become important. The effects of various parameters like the magnetic Reynolds number, imposed field wavenumber etc. on the bifurcation of the flow are studied. Magnetic field line reconnections occurring during the dynamic runaway reveal a specific two-step pattern that leads to the gradual expulsion of flux in the core region."

abstract,"Abstract We investigate the motion of circular vortex sheets with surface tension. A linear stability analysis shows that high modes of the circular vortex sheet are stabilized by surface tension, and the sheet is stable if surface tension is larger than a critical value. The modes of perturbations, n = 1 and 2, are always stable, regardless of surface tension, and the mode n = 3 is also stable for large surface tension. The numerical results show that a stable vortex sheet rotates and oscillates weakly. The oscillations of each mode of the interface mainly consist of two travelling waves of different frequencies in time. The amplitude and the period of the oscillation depend on the mode of the perturbation and surface tension. We also perform long-time computations for the unstable evolution of circular sheets. For a high Weber number, ripples are produced on the sheets, as well as pinching and self-intersection. It is found that the appearance of ripples is associated with the growth of noise. For an intermediate Weber number, the sheet evolves to an exotic structure with small spikes on the fingers, while for a low Weber number, it is nonlinearly stable."

abstract,"Abstract The problem of steady axisymmetric deformations of a liquid sessile drop on a flat solid surface under an impinging gas jet is of interest for understanding the fundamental behavior of free surface flows as well as for establishing the theoretical basis in process design for the Aerosol \({{\rm Jet}^{\circledR}}\) direct-write technology. It is studied here numerically using a Galerkin finite-element method, by computing solutions of Navier–Stokes equations. For effective material deposition in Aerosol \({{\rm Jet}^{\circledR}}\) printing, the desired value of Reynolds number for the laminar gas jet is found to be greater than ~500. The sessile drop can be severely deformed by an impinging gas jet when the capillary number is approaching a critical value beyond which no steady axisymmetric free surface deformation can exist. Solution branches in a parameter space show turning points at the critical values of capillary number, which typically indicate the onset of free surface shape instability. By tracking solution branches around turning points with an arc-length continuation algorithm, critical values of capillary number can be accurately determined. Near turning points, all the free surface profiles in various parameter settings take a common shape with a dimple at the center and bulge near the contact line. An empirical formula for the critical capillary number for sessile drops with \({45^{\circ}}\) contact angle is derived for typical ranges of jet Reynolds number and relative drop sizes especially pertinent to Aerosol \({{\rm Jet}^{\circledR}}\) printing."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of this paper is to conduct a statistical analysis of the effects of the fillet radii on the dynamics of the falling plate using the nonintrusive spectral projection (NISP) method. The free fall of two-dimensional cards immersed in a fluid was studied using a deterministic and stochastic numerical approach. The motion is characterized by the fluid-body interaction described by coupling the Navier–Stokes and rigid body dynamic equations. The model’s predictions have been validated using both experimental and numerical data available in the literature. In the stochastic simulations, the fillet radius of the plate was considered a random variable characterized by a uniform probability density function introducing, in this way, some uncertainties in the plate’s trajectory. To take into account the uncertainties, we employed the NISP method based on polynomial chaos expansion. The analysis was focused on finding the ensemble mean trajectory and error bar for a confidence interval of 95 % for both tumbling and fluttering regimes."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a numerical analysis of the hole-tone phenomenon (Rayleigh’s bird-call), based on a three-dimensional discrete vortex method. Evaluation of the sound generated by the self-sustained flow oscillations is based on the Powell–Howe theory of vortex sound and a boundary integral/element method. While the fundamental problem can be modeled well under the assumption of axial symmetry, the purpose of employing a full three-dimensional model is to investigate the influence of non-axisymmetric perturbations of the jet on the sound generation (with a view to flow control). Experimentally, such perturbations can be applied at the jet nozzle via piezoelectric or electro-mechanical actuators, placed circumferentially inside the nozzle at its exit. In the mathematical/numerical model, this is simulated by wave motions of a deformable nozzle. Both standing and traveling (rotating) waves are considered. It is shown that a considerable reduction of the sound generation is possible."

abstract,"Abstract The counter-propagating Rossby wave perspective to shear flow instability is extended here to the weakly nonlinear phase. The nonlinear action at a distance interaction mechanism between a pair of waves is identified and separated from the linear one. In the former, the streamwise velocity converges the far-field vorticity anomaly of the opposed wave, whereas in the latter, the cross-stream velocity advects the far-field mean vorticity. A truncated analytical model of two vorticity interfaces shows that higher harmonics generated by the nonlinear interaction act as a forcing on the nonnormal linear dynamics. Furthermore, an intrinsic positive feedback toward small-scale enstrophy results from the fact that higher harmonic pair of waves are generated in anti-phase configuration which is favored for nonnormal growth. Near marginal stability, the waves preserve their structure and numerical simulations of the weakly nonlinear interaction show wave saturation into finite amplitudes, in good agreement both with the fixed point solution of the truncated model, as well as with its corresponding weakly nonlinear Ginzburg–Landau amplitude equation."

abstract,"Abstract The effects of discretization on the equations, and their solutions, describing Rayleigh–Bénard convection are studied through linear stability analysis and numerical integration of the discretized equations. Linear stability analyses of the discretized equations were conducted in the usual manner except that the assumed solution contained discretized components (e.g., spatial grid interval in the x direction, \({\Delta x}\)). As the resolution became infinitely high (\({\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\)), the solutions approached those obtained from the continuous equations. The wavenumber of the maximum growth rate increased with increasing \({\Delta x}\) until the wavenumber reached a minimum resolvable resolution, \({\pi \Delta x^{-1}}\). Therefore, the discretization of equations tends to reproduce higher-wavenumber structures than those predicted by the continuous equations. This behavior is counter intuitive and opposed to the expectation of \({\Delta x}\) leading to blurred simulated convection structures. However, when the analysis is conducted for discretized equations that are not combined into a single equation, as is the case for practically solved numerical models, the maximum growing wavenumber rather tends to decrease with increasing \({\Delta x}\) as intuitively expected. The degree of the decrease depends on the discretization accuracy of the first-order differentials. When the accuracy of the discretization scheme is of low order, the wavenumber monotonically decreases with increasing \({\Delta x}\). On the other hand, when higher-order schemes are used for the discretization, the wavenumber does increase with increasing \({\Delta x}\), a similar trend to that in the case of the single-discretized equation for smaller \({\Delta x}\)."

abstract,"Abstract This work proposes a new simulation methodology to study variable density turbulent buoyant flows. The mathematical framework, referred to as homogeneous buoyant turbulence, relies on a triply periodic domain and incorporates numerical forcing methods commonly used in simulation studies of homogeneous, isotropic flows. In order to separate the effects due to buoyancy from those due to large-scale gradients, the linear scalar forcing technique is used to maintain the scalar variance at a constant value. Two sources of kinetic energy production are considered in the momentum equation, namely shear via an isotropic forcing term and buoyancy via the gravity term. The simulation framework is designed such that the four dimensionless parameters of importance in buoyant mixing, namely the Reynolds, Richardson, Atwood, and Schmidt numbers, can be independently varied and controlled. The framework is used to interrogate fully non-buoyant, fully buoyant, and partially buoyant turbulent flows. The results show that the statistics of the scalar fields (mixture fraction and density) are not influenced by the energy production mechanism (shear vs. buoyancy). On the other hand, the velocity field exhibits anisotropy, namely a larger variance in the direction of gravity which is associated with a statistical dependence of the velocity component on the local fluid density."

abstract,"Abstract A comprehensive study was performed to analyze the unsteady laminar flow characteristics around a porously covered, a fully porous, and a solid squared section cylinder located in the middle of a plane channel. In order to simulate fluid flow inside porous media and porous–fluid interface accurately (minimizing modeling error), the porous region was analyzed in pore scale, using LBM. Additionally, to minimize the LBM-related compressibility error through the porous region, a multi-block multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT-LBM) was used. Also, to decrease CPU time, a Navier–Stokes flow solver, based on finite volume method and SIMPLE algorithm, was coupled with MRT-LBM to simulate flow around the porous obstacle. It should be noted that the flow inside the porous layer is in continuum regime, and hence, the no-slip boundary condition was used to treat the solid walls inside the porous media. In our simulations, we considered variations of porosity and Reynolds number ranging from 0.75 to 0.94 and from 60 to 240, respectively. The effects of porosity and Reynolds number on vortex pattern, mean drag coefficient, amplitude of lift coefficient, and Strouhal number were investigated. Comparison of our results with the ones obtained using Open FOAM, as well as published by others, shows the suitable accuracy of our computations. It is seen that at low Reynolds numbers or at low porosities, where the mean flow does not have large enough momentum to penetrate porous media, the resulting flow field and aerodynamic coefficients are relatively close for three different configurations used. However, as the flow Reynolds number or permeability increases, the mean flow penetrates easier into the porous media and thus provides different shedding characteristics and aerodynamic coefficients for different obstacle shapes."

abstract,"Abstract Consideration is given to the kinetic energy balance of a localized two-dimensional vortex in unbounded space, subject to a uniform background shear flow. For this problem, a quadratic invariant based on the total flow can be constructed that consists of the sum of the vortex self-energy and the energy of interaction with the background flow. It is shown that an energy equation also may be written for the rate of change of vortex self-energy, relating this to the rate of working by the Reynolds stress. The stress integral is demonstrated to converge for a localized vortex of finite circulation, in contrast to the total kinetic energy. The two approaches to the energy balance are shown to be complementary, and the relation between the Reynolds stress and interaction energy is discussed. As an example, the integrated Reynolds stress is evaluated for a uniformly sheared elliptical (Kirchhoff) vortex. The stress integral includes far field contributions, indicating that appreciable exchange of energy with the external flow occurs well beyond the boundary of the vortex."

abstract,"Abstract Linear waves are investigated in a rotating gas under the condition of strong centrifugal acceleration of the order 106 g realized in gas centrifuges for separation of uranium isotopes. Sound waves split into three families of the waves under these conditions. Dispersion equations are obtained. The characteristics of the waves strongly differ from the conventional sound waves on polarization, velocity of propagation and distribution of energy of the waves in space for two families having frequencies above and below the frequency of the conventional sound waves. The energy of these waves is localized in rarefied region of the gas. The waves of the third family were not specified before. They propagate exactly along the rotational axis with the conventional sound velocity. These waves are polarized only along the rotational axis. Radial and azimuthal motions are not excited. Energy of the waves is concentrated near the wall of the rotor where the density of the gas is largest."

One of the distinguished features of our IB method is to use level-set techniques in the cut-cells near the irregular boundary, where accurate discretization is of paramount importance for stability and accuracy of the computations. For this purpose, we present here an accurate discretization of the velocity gradients and shear rate in the cut-cells that fits elegantly in the framework of the velocity–pressure–stress staggered arrangement and the special quadratures developed previously for viscoelastic flows. After assessing the accuracy of the discretization on a benchmark solution for power-law fluids, the LS-STAG code is applied to the flow of various shear-thinning xanthan solutions in a wide-gap, non-coaxial, Taylor–Couette reactor for which rheological characterization, experimental flow measurements (PIV) and FLUENT simulations have recently been performed in our group. Our numerical investigation will give new insight on the flow patterns (onset, size and position of the recirculation zone) and will firmly correlate them to global flow properties such as shear-thinning index, generalized Reynolds number and torque ratio at the cylinders."

abstract,"Abstract Data generated by direct numerical simulation (DNS) for a Mach 2.75 zero-pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer interacting with shocks of different intensities are used for a priori analysis of subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence and various terms in the compressible filtered Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical method used for DNS is based on a hybrid scheme that uses a non-dissipative central scheme in the shock-free turbulent regions and a robust monotonicity-preserving scheme in the shock regions. The behavior of SGS stresses and their components, namely Leonard, Cross and Reynolds components, is examined in various regions of the flow for different shock intensities and filter widths. The backscatter in various regions of the flow is found to be significant only instantaneously, while the ensemble-averaged statistics indicate no significant backscatter. The budgets for the SGS kinetic energy equation are examined for a better understanding of shock–tubulence interactions at the subgrid level and also with the aim of providing useful information for one-equation LES models. A term-by-term analysis of SGS terms in the filtered total energy equation indicate that while each term in this equation is significant by itself, the net contribution by all of them is relatively small. This observation is consistent with our a posteriori analysis."

abstract,"Abstract Görtler vortices evolve in boundary layers over concave surfaces as a result of the imbalance between centrifugal effects and radial pressure gradients. Depending on various geometrical and flow conditions, these vortices can significantly distort the baseline flow and lead to secondary instabilities and ultimately to transition. In this study, the growth of Görtler vortices excited by distributed roughness elements is analyzed using the solution to the nonlinear boundary region equations with upstream boundary conditions derived previously via an asymptotic analysis applied in the vicinity of the roughness elements. Generalized Rayleigh pressure equation derived based on the assumption that the baseline flow is a function of the transverse coordinates only is used to determine the growth rates associated with the secondary instabilities. Within the analysis, the roughness shape, height and diameter as well as the spanwise separation between the roughness elements are varied in the linear regime, while keeping the same Görtler number. It is found that bell-shaped distributed roughness elements are more likely to excite the Görtler instabilities than sharp-edge-type (e.g., cylindrical) roughness elements, and by increasing the roughness diameter, the strength of Görtler vortices associated with the bell-shaped roughness elements increases as expected, but the strength of Görtler vortices associated with cylindrical-shaped roughness elements decreases."

abstract,"Abstract This paper introduces a 2D lattice Boltzmann-Saltation (LBM-Saltation) model for numerical simulation of velocity profiles of windblown sand particles. The model is based on the LBM equations for transient, incompressible viscous flow. We first introduced a lattice Boltzmann subgrid model, which was used to predict the turbulent wind field. Two-way coupling was then used to describe the interaction between wind and the saltating sand particles. The correctness of the model was verified by comparing the simulated results of several important variables of wind-sand flow with that of experiment over a flat bed surface. To show the feasibility of this model with complex boundary conditions, we used it to simulate the wind-sand flow at porous wind fences and mainly discussed the particle velocity profiles. Single porous wind fence case was computed first and compared with the measurement. Two tandem porous wind fences cases were simulated next. Different distance and porosity of the fences were considered to quantitatively investigate the variation of the shelter effect. The simulated results achieved additional conclusions: The wind speed and the velocity of sand particles are obviously weakened because of the fence; reduction of the particle velocity by porous fence varies with the fence distance and porosity; the larger the distance or the porosity (significantly larger than the 0.3), the worse the shelter effect, and the weaker the reduction of particle velocity."

abstract,"Abstract The interaction of a vortex and a pipe flow, modelled as the Lamb–Oseen vortex and the Poiseuille flow, respectively, is investigated by means of stability analyses and direct numerical simulations (DNS). From the distribution of the most unstable mode, it is observed that the instability is induced by the combination of the radial gradients of the base azimuthal and axial velocity components, e.g. an axial (or azimuthal) vorticity perturbation acts on the axial (or azimuthal) base velocity via a lift-up effect to generate axial (or azimuthal) velocity streaks, which are further stretched by the base azimuthal (or axial) velocity to create azimuthal (or axial) vorticity. This lift-up-stretch mechanism is confirmed in DNS of the model base flow initially perturbed by the most unstable mode. After nonlinear saturation, the perturbations decay since the flow no longer supports instability after sufficient radial mixing induced by the lift-up of the azimuthal and axial velocity components. These observations suggest that the vorticity outside the vortex core can be suppressed by instabilities if a streamwise boundary layer flow exists outside the core."

I study the effect of increases in cigarette prices following the MSA on alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year olds to determine the economic relationship between cigarettes and alcohol among young adults. I perform analyses at both the conditional mean and quantiles and find that increases in cigarette prices reduce drinking participation among young adults at the extensive margin. However, conditional upon one’s decision to drink, higher cigarette prices increase alcohol consumption. Such a pattern of substitution is concentrated between the 40th and 50th conditional quantiles. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when considering cigarettes and alcohol as complements."

abstract,"Abstract Estimates of extended household income (the sum of market income and the imputed value of non-market household production) should adjust for differences in household size and composition using equivalence scales. However, the equivalence parameters traditionally applied to market income do not plausibly apply to non-market income. Economies of scale in the relationship between living standards and household income are greater for non-market income from household production than market income, and the costs of children relative to adults are higher in household production time than in cash expenditures. Also, the presence of a full-time family caregiver significantly reduces cash expenditures on child care. This paper proposes equivalence scales that can be separately applied to the components of extended income, and demonstrates their empirical relevance with pooled data from the American Time Use Survey for 2010–2014. The proposed parameters significantly alter the relative contribution of non-market income to extended income and modify comparisons of extended income across different family household types, with particularly significant implications for the relative well-being of those with and without full-time family caregivers."

I simulate a marriage market to predict potential spouse earnings for a sample of single mothers in order to estimate the potential losses or gains in earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage. Using multinomial logistic regressions, I then analyze how the anticipated loss in earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage affects the likelihood of marrying or cohabiting. Results  suggest that the average earned income tax credit-eligible woman can expect to lose approximately US$1,300 in earned income tax credit benefits in the year following marriage, or about half of pre-marriage benefits. Single mothers who expect to lose earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage are 2.5 percentage points less likely to marry their partners and 2.5 percentage points more likely to cohabit compared to single mothers who expect no change or to gain earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage. Despite recent policy efforts to reduce the size of the marriage penalty embedded in the earned income tax credit structure, these results suggest that the earned income tax credit still creates distortions in marriage and cohabitation decisions among low-income single mothers."

Enforcement policies such as wage withholding also may affect father–child contact even when the amount of support paid is not affected if they change bargaining power between parents or the salience of fathers’ child support obligations. I develop a model of the salience of child support obligations which predicts that introduction of automatic withholding will reduce contact between noncustodial parents and children independent of payment amount. I then examine whether paying child support via wage withholding affects fathers’ frequency of contact with their children and their provision of in-kind support using instrumental variables and bounded OLS techniques for selection on unobservables. Withholding appears to decrease father–child contact. Withholding effects do not occur when payments are made to government agencies or courts but are present when payments go directly to the mother, consistent with bargaining models. More frequent payment schedules are associated with more contact, consistent with salience effects."

Previous research has found many negative consequences of food insecurity for families and households but has not examined its relationship with housing instability. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, difference-in-difference models show that food insecurity is associated with housing instability. The association remains statistically significant after accounting for potential selection and unobserved heterogeneity using propensity score matching and excluding households that experienced prior housing instability from the sample. Examining potential mediating factors, I find that material hardship explains about half of this association. These findings suggest that maintaining a strong social safety net would reduce the risk that families experience material hardship and housing instability, which may also reduce the risk of homelessness."

First, a female whose own immediate family is at least as rich as her husband’s counterpart enjoys a greater say over children- and asset-related decision-making. Second, the size, relative wealth and proximity of the extended family also matter. Third, kinship characteristics prove to be more important than (standard) individual and household characteristics. Finally, we also show that the female’s say over asset-related decision-making is positively associated with males’ education, more than with female’s education per se. All these correlation patterns can inform policies aiming at empowering women or targeting children through women’s empowerment."

abstract,"Abstract Up to 1987 the Spanish Income Tax imposed compulsory joint filing for married couples. However, the 1988 reform allowed spouses to choose between joint and separate taxation, involving a reduction in tax rates for secondary earners. Our aim is to analyze this reform as a quasi-natural experiment, assessing the effects of tax changes on labor participation. To find out the causal effect we adopt the difference-in-differences technique. We use data from the ‘Spanish Income Tax Panel 1982–1998’. Our results show that, as a consequence of differential tax changes, married women in families more strongly affected by the fiscal reform increase their labor participation more than secondary earners from families less affected by the reform. The participation rate for secondary earners in the treatment group increases by 9.4 percentage points whereas the control group increases their participation rate by 7.8 percentage points. We define the treatment group as those secondary earners in relatively low-income families in year 1987 and the control group as those in middle-high income families, because the former experiences a stronger reduction in tax rates than the latter. As a result, we can attribute the 1.6-percentage-point-increase in participation rates to the 1988 income tax reform."

The goal of this paper is twofold: to document and analyze the labor force participation of military wives between 1990 and 2010, using the U.S. Census and American Community Survey data, and to compare the relationship between migration and labor force participation for military and non-military wives. We find that the primary suspects to explain the widening gap are the repeated migration for military wives, and the deepening of the recession."

abstract,"Abstract It has been argued that child care should be treated separately from leisure or housework when analyzing time use data. This is because child care has a positive income gradient, whereas leisure and housework do not. Using U.S. data from PSID-CDS, this paper computes parental child care during and outside of typical work hours (TWH) by income quintile for two-parent families. The TWH distinction is important because the opportunity cost of spending time with children is first and foremost in terms of forgone earnings during TWH; outside of TWH, leisure or housework mainly constitute this opportunity cost. Indeed, I find that child care decreases with income during TWH and, hence, behaves similarly to leisure and other household chores. While maternal child care also slightly decreases with income outside of TWH, paternal care increases with income outside of TWH. Also, the discrepancy between paternal and maternal child care is smaller outside of TWH than it is during TWH. This is particularly pronounced in high income families. Theoretical implications are derived in a static framework of time allocation and child quality production encompassing the recent literature on the topic. Variation in child care during TWH can be rationalized by assuming a high elasticity of substitution between leisure, consumption and child quality. This is the standard explanation for the patterns observed in leisure and housework. Within this widely used framework, however, the facts outside of TWH point to systematic differences by income in preferences or productivity. Further exploration of child care patterns during and outside of TWH is needed to inform us about the dimensions in which this widely used framework should be extended."

We exploit panel variation across states prior to the Supreme Court decision to investigate the effect of marriage laws on demand for mortgage credit. Identification relies on the fact that states permitted same-sex marriage at different points in time, often through court order whereby the outcome and timing of ruling was unknown. We estimate that states permitting same-sex marriage experienced a 6–16% increase in same-sex mortgage applications after the policy was implemented. Federal recognition of marriage is associated with a stronger effect than state same-sex marriage prior to the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, but the effect of state-recognized marriage is also stronger than anti-discrimination policies in housing. Our findings provide important insight not only to the housing choices of same-sex households but the impact of marriage on all households."

These results mask strong heterogeneities. On the one hand, the positive association between grandparental care and child outcomes is stronger for children from more advantaged households; on the other, the negative association is only significant for those from more disadvantaged households. The results of OLS estimations used for our analysis are confirmed using panel methods and an instrumental variable approach."

These findings are consistent with cooperative bargaining models and with models viewing individuals as having a demand for household production services by a spouse, with market forces influencing the price of such services. In addition, we find that men benefit more from marriage than women and that this gender gap is more pronounced for older couples. This is likely to be due to social norms and prescribed gender roles which are more prevalent within the older generation."

Using data drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey–Replication, we examine the link between self-reported happiness, a broad gauge of subjective well-being, and four types of traumatic victimization that may occur at various points in the life cycle. In particular, we consider the association between home violence, sexual assault, community violence, and stalking and subsequent victims’ adult happiness. For females and males, we find that each of these traumas significantly reduces self-reported happiness later in the life course, and for both women and men, the estimated impact of home violence is greatest. Furthermore, we find that the adverse effects of trauma on happiness are comparable to the impact of critical socioeconomic developments on happiness. Moreover, we find that experiencing more than one type of these four traumas has a greater negative impact on subsequent happiness than experiencing only one type. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls, and the influence of trauma on subsequent happiness is independent of personal and family characteristics. Since happiness and mental health are closely related, our work suggests that traumatic victimization undermines overall health and well-being in the U.S."

We then explicitly assess the relative importance of the mother’s versus the father’s assessments in explaining child academic performance and diagnosed mental health to investigate whether one parent is systematically a better informant of their child’s outcomes than the other. Our results show that parental psychopathology, measured as maternal distress, is a source of systematic misreporting of child functioning, that the parent–child relationship matters, and that mothers are not necessarily a better informant of child functioning than fathers. This last finding should not only be valid for Denmark but also for many other countries, where the father’s role in childcare has been growing."

We find that all the age groups cooperate more when playing with relatives, indicating that family ties may have a positive relationship to contributions to the Public Good. We also find that this trend is more evident for the youths and the parents than for the grandparents. Furthermore, young individuals tend to cooperate less than older generations, especially in non-family treatments. Our results serve as evidence of the relationship between family ties and inter-generational cooperative behaviors."

The empirical analysis shows that there is imperfect consumption risk-sharing between birth-year cohorts in Turkey.

Finally, we find that cohorts would have sacrificed modest amounts to insure their consumption."

abstract,"Abstract Caregiving for grandchildren is becoming common and plays an important role in the childcare system in many countries. This study examines whether caregiving for grandchildren has a causal effect on grandparents’ cognitive functioning, using a longitudinal survey of older Koreans. To assess the causal relationship, we estimate a fixed-effects instrumental variable model by using the presence of a married child and a child aged 31–40 years as instruments. The estimation results reveal that caregiving for grandchildren significantly improves grandparents’ cognitive functioning. Caregiving for grandchildren is predicted to improve global cognitive functioning score by 30.05%, orientation score by 19.85%, delayed recall score by 95.58%, and language ability score by 30.10%. In addition, the effect of grandparent caregiving is salient among females as well as lower-income and less educated groups. Our findings suggest that caregiving for grandchildren, which is one of the most common forms of informal care, may play a complementary role to formal care."

Our results are twofold: first, we find evidence in favour of the precautionary saving hypothesis. Secondly, we find that, unlike other variables related to the performance of the labour market (such as the unemployment rate) the job insecurity indicator is an appropriate variable to approximate income uncertainty in any macroeconomic context."

abstract,"Abstract This study investigates the marriage protection and selection effects among middle-aged and elderly Japanese. Using 9 years of a longitudinal data set from a nationally representative survey in Japan from 2005 to 2013, we extract 15,242 respondents aged 50–59 years in the baseline year. We utilize positive self-rated health to present subjective health status and lifestyle diseases to present objective health status. Using dynamic panel data approach to control for endogeneity issue, we find that being married does protect respondents’ subjective health, in terms of a higher probability of self-ratings of “very good” or “good” health statuses. Nonetheless, we find that marriage deteriorated their objective health in terms of a higher probability of having lifestyle diseases. Regarding the selection effect, better subjective health is found to select middle-aged and elderly Japanese into marriage, but such influence is fairly modest. Although objective health status also selects respondents into marriage, it positively affects women but adversely affects men. The findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between marriage and health, which may have substantial implications for health-related public policies for middle-aged and elderly people in Japan."

abstract,"Abstract In the past two decades Iranian women have become much better educated and reduced their fertility, by more than two-thirds. However, their participation in market work has not increased appreciably. We turn to time-use data to better understand the relationship between women’s education and their time use, specially time allocated to children and market work. We employ new data from a time-use survey of urban households in 2009 and show that education affects the time use of married women in predictable ways, increasing their time in market work and child education and reducing their time in housework. These results indicate that in Iran productivity of women’s education is realized in the market as well as at home, in particular in investment in children. The fact that more educated women devote more time to market work and child education, the two activities that contribute to economic growth, challenges the notion prevalent in the conservative policy circles in Iran that public resources allocated to women’s education are somehow wasted."

abstract,"Abstract We empirically analyze the relationship between income inequality and individual preferences for public redistribution, focusing on intra-household income inequality between spouses. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we find that both one’s own earned income and earned intra-household income inequality are significantly negatively related to preferences for public redistribution. However, as the earned income inequality between partners increases, the poorer partner’s preference for public redistribution declines while the richer partner’s preference for public redistribution increases. The poorer partners’ preferences may, in fact, indicate preferences for intra-household redistribution from the richer to the poorer partner. The richer partners’ preferences may be explained by the fact that, when married, they can realize tax savings and, therefore, have to pay relatively less for public redistribution. Moreover, our results confirm previous findings regarding a partner’s future social mobility prospects upon cohabitation ending, because they show that having a strong outside option, i.e., a high wage potential, is significantly negatively related to redistributive preferences, especially among those with an above-average future wage potential."

The results show that a high level of alcohol consumption of one household member significantly affects the allocation of household resources and suggest thought-provoking policy implications."

Most previous studies use unit values, which are subject to several biases and reflect economizing choices made by households, so may not reliably estimate the bulk discount schedule. Instead, individual transaction records in household expenditure diaries are used, which report expenditure, quantity, brand, unit size and number purchased per transaction. The bulk discount schedule is estimated for four foods (rice, canned meat, canned fish and chicken) that make up one-third of the total food budget in a survey in urban Papua New Guinea. For each food we use the dominant brand(s) so there is no quality variation and the estimated price schedule only reflects discounts due to variations in purchase quantity. All foods have precisely measured but small elasticities of unit price with respect to quantity purchased."

In 2002, in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, Program 132 directed the transfer of farm land to ethnic minority households that had less than one hectare of land. Using the 2002 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey as a baseline, in 2008 we resurveyed over one-thousand households to provide a retrospective evaluation of the impact of their participation in Program 132. Contrary to official reports, our findings show that there was considerable deviation from the planned program parameters: many eligible households did not receive land, while ineligible households often did. We estimate that beneficiaries of the program in the province of Kon Tum experienced increases of household income largely in line with what one would expect from a small plot of poor farm land. Outside Kon Tum, where participation rates were substantially lower, the story is more mixed, and household incomes did not improve with program participation. Overall, our results underscore the limitations of simple transfers of land as a mechanism for improving the living standards of ethnic minorities. Our results also show the significant gap that can exist between program design and decentralized implementation. We discuss the potential implications for program evaluation."

We examine several possible channels for this correlation, and test its sensitivity to observable characteristics of individuals, households, and regions in order to infer the scope for selection on unobservables to drive the polygamy-child mortality correlation. We find a statistically significant positive relationship between polygamy and child mortality in the modern period, and a statistically insignificant positive relationship in the historical data. Although there is a limited role for polygamist-specific intra-household dynamics and behavioral practices in shaping the mortality of children in such households, the sensitivity of the polygamy-child mortality correlation is consistent with an important role for selection into polygamy, particularly on unobservable characteristics."

abstract,"Abstract This paper explores the welfare and livelihood strategies of women in rural Tanzania after they exit marriage. We draw from a three-wave individual-level longitudinal survey, using a correlated random effects approach within regression analysis to control for time-invariant individual effects. Attention is given to whether women exit marriage through widowhood or divorce, and whether they subsequently become household heads or join another household. Nearly 40% of widowed or divorced women are not the heads of their households, but instead reside with relatives. We find that women, and particularly widows, are more likely to be poor after marriage exit. Upon widowhood or divorce, women also work longer hours in off-farm employment, and those who become household heads are especially likely to experience a reduction in land access and a heightened reliance on non-farm income, including the receipt of transfers. This underscores the importance of both the non-farm economy and family networks for women’s livelihoods after marriage. Results  illustrate that women’s experiences outside of marriage are diverse and cannot be broadly proxied with a household status of being female-headed."

In this paper, we estimate the distributional and behavioral impacts of a simulated new benefit in Spain based on the replacement of the existing working mother tax credit (WMTC) using as a reference the US Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). We simulate the effects of the proposed scheme using EUROMOD and a discrete choice model of labor supply. Our results show that the enhancement of the proposed reform would have significant and positive effects both in terms of female labor participation and inequality and poverty reduction. The introduction of this benefit would generate a substantial increase in labor participation at the extensive margin and a non-negligible reduction at the intensive margin."

abstract,"Abstract Intrahousehold resource allocations have important implications for policies targeted at household resources and thus household welfare. Recent literature has shown, for single headed households, that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits may be inadequate to reach a nutritious diet due to a “time deficit” gap in food production. This paper first develops a simple theoretically based time adjustment multiplier to address this benefit inadequacy for single and dual headed households. A method is then developed for estimating spousal time in food production with limited data. The estimated time deficit gap and time adjustment multiplier are smaller for dual headed households than single headed households. For single headed households, the time adjusted benefits are about $107 per household per week higher than the unadjusted benefits. For dual headed households, ignoring the spousal time contribution, the time adjusted benefits are about $73 per household per week higher than the unadjusted benefits. However, by including the spousal time contribution, this benefit shortfall is reduced by about $50. These findings demonstrate the importance of taking into account intrahousehold time allocation in evaluating the adequacy of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits."

However, the labor market outcomes of the “1.5 generation” (1.5g), the foreign born who migrate as children, have not been thoroughly analyzed. This paper hypothesizes that the 1.5g could have an earnings advantage relative to subsequent generations due to the higher ability of their parents; however, the accumulation of destination-specific human capital (i.e., acculturation) also declines with age at migration (AAM). Using a Mincerian earnings regression as applied to CPS data (1994–2016), this analysis tests whether there is a within-group “critical” AAM threshold after which the earnings advantage of the 1.5g becomes an earnings disadvantage. Results  show that this threshold is approximately ages 5–9, varying by ethnicity and gender."

We hypothesized that financially literate people are more able to earn income and accumulate assets, leading them to have a less anxious life in old age. On the other hand, less financially literate people rely more on social security to secure themselves in the old age as they are not able to accumulate sufficient assets. By using US survey data, we provide evidence that assets significantly reduce anxiety about life in old age only for people who are more financially literate. For less financially literate people, social security plays an important role in reducing anxiety about life in old age. Besides these, having a child and doing regular exercise also reduced anxiety for all respondents but marital status reduced anxiety in respondents over 40 years of age. The results of our study are robust to measurement of financial literacy and endogeneity problems."

abstract,"Abstract Although there is considerable research evidence showing that immigrants are at great risk of poverty, there have been few comparative analyses of the poverty gap between immigrants and natives across Europe. We examine the patterns of variation in the immigrant–native poverty gap between and within countries. We simultaneously combine characteristics of households from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and some key country-specific factors, distinguishing among mixed and non-mixed immigrant households and natives. The main findings for 2012 reveal that immigrants, especially non-mixed immigrant households, are exposed to a higher risk of poverty than natives, though this gap varies across countries. We find evidence of significant household-level effects, but the contribution of country-level variables to explain cross-country differences in the poverty gap is substantially higher. Concerning household characteristics, employment and being young have less effect (positive and negative, respectively) on immigrants than on natives, while each additional child has a more negative effect. Education seems to have a lower effect on the likelihood of being poor for non-mixed immigrant households than for natives and owning a house reduces this likelihood more for non-mixed immigrant households. In terms of country-level factors, labour market and social benefits seem to be equally important for both natives and immigrants. We also compare the results in 2012 with those for 2007 to check for possible changes over time related to the influence of the economic cycle on the poverty gap and/or on the importance of household- and country-level factors."

The main objective of this study is to examine how drinking behavior developed over an economic boom, subsequent crisis, and an eventual recovery. We use individual longitudinal data collected through a postal survey by The Directorate of Health in Iceland in 2007, 2009, and 2012. Pooled OLS and linear probability models are used to study four outcomes: Alcohol-consumption frequency, frequency of binge drinking, binge-drinking participation and alcohol dependence. Alcohol-consumption frequency declined during the crisis, with a further decline during the recovery period. This change is driven by female behavior between 2007 and 2009, but a combined gender effect between 2009 and 2012. This effect is suppressed by male labor-market-changes, but partly mediated by labor marked changes in the case of females. Alcohol dependence declined during the crisis, with suggestive evidence of partially reverting back to previous levels during the recovery. There is some indication that during the crisis real price changes of alcohol played a role in the decline in alcohol consumption but that is not a likely determinant of changes in alcohol consumption for the 3 year period post-crisis that we explore. Men’s consumption can partly be explained through income changes while women’s consumption changes are rather driven by changes in work hours or other factors."

Using a joint adoption-influence econometric model, we find compelling evidence that women’s influence over intra-household decisions significantly increases adoption. We further distinguish between alternative sources of women’s influence, and argue that our distinction has potential implications for ICS dissemination policies. We find that while there is significant variation in women’s influence across rural India due to cultural and other sociological factors, the effect of intra-household influence on adoption has a significant bargaining power component. Our results suggest that ICS programs may be able to increase adoption by marketing stoves in ways that empower women."

(3) Couples’ synchronous time is significantly correlated to the husband’s and the wife’s labor supply and job characteristics, including wage rates, employment status, and occupation, as well as other personal characteristics and household demographics. This correlation differs between urban and rural couples. Generally speaking, urban couples are more similar to their Western counterparts. This paper is the first to provide a profile of couples’ coordination of time allocation in the socioeconomic context of a developing country, and it deepens the understanding of couples’ joint time allocation."

abstract,"Abstract The literature has shown that an increase in housing wealth, driven by unexpected shocks to house prices, exerts a positive effect on the birthrates of homeowners. According to canonical models, a decrease in housing wealth has a symmetric negative impact on the fertility behavior of households. That is, housing gains and losses of the same size have identical quantitative effects on fertility. In comparison, the reference-dependent preferences in prospect theory suggest that people care more about housing losses than equivalent gains, leading to an asymmetric effect of housing wealth on the fertility decision. We propose a theoretical model where household utility depends on both childbirth and housing wealth. In this model, the utility from housing wealth is reference dependent in the sense that we assume the housing value in the previous year is the reference. The theoretical model suggests that a decrease in housing wealth would have a larger impact on the probability of childbirth than an equivalent increase. We test this theoretical prediction using longitudinal data on Japanese households. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, our empirical results show that the fertility responses of homeowners are substantially larger for housing losses than equivalent gains."

However, few empirical studies have examined how time spent on health investment is determined. In this paper, we fill this void in the literature by investigating how people allocate their time for different types of health-related activities in response to economic variables. Using the American Time Use Survey, we distinguish health-enhancing and health-deteriorating leisure activities, with the rationale that these activities may respond differently to socioeconomic environment. We find that health-enhancing and health-deteriorating time respond to economic variables in opposite directions. Specifically, a higher wage rate leads to a reduction in health-deteriorating activities but an increase in health-enhancing activities, particularly those with an investment nature. This finding holds for most subsamples we examine. Our result implies substantial substitution within nonmarket time."

However, conditional on seeing any clients, college-educated prostitutes see more clients and provide longer client sessions. We demonstrate that these results are consistent with a model in which college-educated prostitutes have better outside options to prostitution, but are also able to reduce the marginal disutility of prostitution work by attracting fewer unpleasant clients and by combining sexual services with non-sexual services such as companionship, where college education may be productive."

We use variation in gender shares by fields of study implied by the recent expansion of college education in 19 European countries, and a difference-in-differences research design, to show that the share of women in study peer groups does not drive early fertility. When there are few available potential partners in one’s field of study, endogamous fertility by college graduates from the same field of study is lower, as expected, but non-endogamous fertility compensates for this effect for both genders. This compensation, however, comes at the cost of increasing the probability of parenting with a less-than-college educated spouse."

I use system generalized method of moments estimator with fixed effects to address the unobserved heterogeneity and the initial conditions problem. I find that older smokers (aged 51 and older) are virtually unresponsive to price changes, and younger smokers (aged 50 and younger) are more price sensitive; women smokers might be more price responsive; and the overall estimated price elasticity for the full sample of smokers is −0.26. In addition, smoke-free air laws do not show significant effects."

abstract,"Abstract This study estimates the associations of income with both (self-reported) child protective services involvement and parenting behaviors that proxy for child abuse and neglect risk among unmarried families. Our primary strategy follows the instrumental variables approach employed by Dahl and Lochner (2012), which leverages variation between states and over time in the generosity of the total state and federal earned income tax credit for which a family is eligible to identify exogenous variation in family income. As a robustness check, we also estimate standard OLS regressions (linear probability models), reduced form OLS regressions, and OLS regressions with the inclusion of a control function (each with and without family-specific fixed effects). Our micro-level data are drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth-cohort of relatively disadvantaged urban children who have been followed from birth to age nine. Results  suggest that an exogenous increase in income is associated with reductions in behaviorally approximated child neglect and CPS involvement, particularly among low-income single-mother families."

abstract,"Abstract This paper develops a theory of female labor supply in a general equilibrium framework in the context of a developing economy. In stage 1, men and women decide whether to get married foreseeing the power and market dynamics in stage 2. Single people make their own decisions whereas married couples make decisions together, the power distribution among partners is determined endogenously. It is shown that female labor supply can take different shapes due to structural differences between economies and multiple equilibria might occur, causing low female labor force participation trap. As for policy implications, we find that tax-break to the employers can give a huge boost to female employment and may reduce the wage-gap. However, tax-benefit to women may widen the wage-gap although both these policies empower women. We also conclude that true empowerment should come with the freedom of choice (to work); increasing female labor force participation does not necessarily empower women. Results  found here resonate well with previous empirical findings and suggest additional testable implications."

abstract,"Abstract A 2010 national policy change due to the Affordable Care Act allowed dependent children to remain on parental health insurance policies until age 26. Evidence shows the mandate increased insurance coverage among affected young adults and also increased premiums for family health insurance policies. In this paper, we investigate the use of dependent tax exemptions as a mechanism families could use to pay for increased costs associated with expanded coverage. Using data on households from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we use a difference-in-difference methodology comparing changes in the likelihood of being claimed as a dependent on a tax return for the 19–25 year olds affected by the coverage mandate compared to 16–18 year olds that were unaffected. We find a significant increase in dependent tax exemptions among 19–25 year olds following implementation of the dependent coverage mandate. Family income gains from switching an exemption from a young adult child to the parent would shift a substantial portion of young adult insurance coverage costs (ultimately medical costs) to other taxpayers. Though we point to family health insurance cost as a likely driver of the increased dependent tax exemptions, we cannot rule out a role for other outcomes also affected by the mandate, including labor market changes among 19–25 year olds. We further compare the overall social costs and benefits of the mandate and show that absent significant health improvement to date, welfare gains likely depend on the positive contribution of young adults to insurance pools in terms of lower average costs."

Second, we find that reduced fertility is associated with higher educational outcomes for immigrant children, possibly through a quantity–quality trade-off. Third, we show that between one-third and the complete difference in family-size adjusted educational outcomes between immigrants from different source countries or immigrant generations can be explained by parental background. This latter holds true for various immigrant groups in both France and Germany, two major European economies with distinct immigration histories."

This difference can cause spouses who have the same utility functions and the same family incomes to differ in their benefits from governmental tax and spending policies, and to cast opposing votes. In particular, these incentives can generate a gender gap, with women more supportive than men of governmental taxes and spending."

abstract,"Abstract The ability to combine work with quality time together as a family is at the heart of the concept of work-life balance. Using previously unexploited data on couples’ work schedules we investigate the effect of flexible working on couples’ coordination of their daily work schedules in the UK. We consider three distinct dimensions of flexible working: flexibility of daily start and finish times (flexitime), flexibility of work times over the year (annualized hours), and generalized control of working hours. We show that having flexitime at work increases a couple’s amount of coordination of their daily work schedules by a half to 1 h, which is double the margin of adjustment enjoyed by couples with no flexitime. The impact is driven by couples with children. In contrast to flexitime, the other two forms of flexible working do not seem to increase synchronous time. Our results suggest that having flexitime plays an important role in relaxing the work scheduling constraints faced by families with young children, and that effective flexible working time arrangements are those that increase the worker’s and not the employer’s flexibility."

Native born bilingualism is rare; only 6.5% report a non-English language, and of those 71% report Spanish. Most of the native-born bilinguals report speaking English “very well” (85%), with most of the others speaking it “well” (10%). Other variables the same, overall bilinguals earn 4.7% less than monolingual English speakers, but the earnings differential varies sharply by the language spoken. Those who speak Native American languages, Pennsylvania Dutch and Yiddish have very low earnings due to a tendency to live in geographic or cultural enclaves. Spanish speakers earn 20% less than the monolingual English speakers overall, and other variables the same, have statistically significant 7% lower earnings. On the other hand, those who speak certain Western European and East Asian languages and Hebrew earn significantly more than monolingual English speakers."

The aim of the paper is to identify the effect of parental separation on child cognitive and behavioural outcomes. It uses data on a sample of around 9000 children up to age 11, drawn from five waves of the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study. We use fixed-effects models to control for unobservable characteristics that do not vary over time, and explore the role of time and of post-separation conditions in mitigating these effects. We find that parental separation has detrimental but small effects on children’s behaviours, and that these effects appear stronger after a couple of years from separation. An intimate relationship between the child and the non-resident father, the presence of a new mother’s partner and of other relatives also play a role. No effect is found on cognitive development."

abstract,"Abstract In Japan, the availability of afterschool childcare for young school children is quite limited, although many preschool children attend daycare centers. As a result, parents experience a sudden lack of formal childcare when their child starts school. This dearth of childcare services is notorious, and has been referred to as the “Wall for Mothers with First Graders”. To illustrate the quantitative impacts of the Wall, I compare the maternal labor supply between nuclear and three-generation households at the time of the firstborn child’s school entry. Since mothers from three-generation households generally substitute formal afterschool childcare with informal childcare provided by the grandparents, I hypothesize that the first child’s school entry mainly affects the labor supply of mothers from nuclear households. Using the Japanese Panel Survey of Consumers, a difference-in-differences/event-study analysis is applied to the sample of mothers whose firstborn child was in daycare as a preschooler. The overall findings are generally consistent with my hypothesis. First, the baseline result shows that the labor market participation rate decreases by 10.9 percentage points at the time of their firstborn child’s school entry among mothers from nuclear households compared with those from three-generation households. Second, the firstborn child’s school entry decreases his/her mother’s daily paid work by about half an hour and increases time allocated to housework and childcare by the same amount. Taken together, this study shows that the shortage of afterschool childcare among nuclear households interrupts maternal labor supply."

abstract,"Abstract Marriage is positively correlated with income, and women with children are much less likely to be in poverty if they are married. Selection into marriage makes it difficult to assess whether these correlations represent a causal effect of marriage. One instrument for marriage proposed in past research is the gender of a woman’s first child. We find that women who have a boy first are about 0.33 percentage points more likely to be married at any point in time. This effect operates through both increasing the probability that unmarried mothers marry the child’s father and reducing the probability of divorce. We also find that women whose first child is a boy experience higher levels of family income and are less likely to receive welfare income, be below the poverty line, and receive food stamps. Estimates using child gender as an instrumental variable for marriage suggest that marriage plays a large causal role in improving the economic well-being of women with children and that these effects are largest among women at the lower end of the income distribution."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between female participation to the familial rural income improvement program (PARFAR) and domestic violence in the rural northern Cameroon. To achieve this, two hypothesis based respectively on the theory of marital bargaining and the theory of men’s backslash are tested applying propensity score matching to survey data from a sample of households in the area, to consider the possibility of sampling bias. A battery of test and estimation methods is used to check the robustness of findings. The results support the backslash theory. PARFAR participation leads to an improvement in the contribution of women in decision-making within the targeted households. This effect is associated with a reduction in violence acceptability but an increase in violence prevalence. This double result which embedded household dynamics in an adversarial logic then raises the question of prior cultural adjustment program for targeted households. Among actions to undertake for such attitudinal change about gender considerations in Cameroon, besides those mobilizing local government, non-governmental organizations and community based organizations, an additional challenge for policymakers could be improving policies facilitating access to legal institutions for victims of domestic violence."

Our evidence comes from a correspondence test performed in France in which we use three different kinds of ethnic identification: French sounding names, North African sounding names, and “foreign” sounding names with no clear ethnic association. Within the groups of men and women, we show that all non-French applicants are equally discriminated against when compared to French applicants. Moreover, we find direct evidence of ethnic homophily: recruiters with European names are more likely to call back French named applicants. These results show the importance of favoritism for in-group members. To test for the effect of information about applicant’s skills, we also add a signal related to language ability in all resumes sent to half the job offers. The design allows to uniquely identify the effect of the language signal by gender. Although the signal inclusion significantly reduces the discrimination against non-French females, it is much weaker for male minorities."

A dynamic discrete choice model is proposed in which agents choose residential arrangements, together with labor supply and marital status, conditional on the economic and institutional framework and on other agents’ choices. The model is structurally estimated with the Simulated Method of Moments for non-student high-school graduate males and then used to assess, through a variety of counterfactual experiments, the relative importance of factors that are claimed to influence the choice to leave home in the existing literature: labor market conditions, parental resources, housing market conditions and social interaction. Results  suggest that Italians choose to remain with their parents due to a combination of poor labor market conditions and high housing costs. The relatively high income of parents could contribute to the patterns observed by acting as an insurance against unemployment. Finally, estimates indicate that individuals tend to conform to a social norm, especially in the South of the country were family ties and the costs in terms of utility from not complying with expected behaviors appear to be stronger."

It has a negative impact in India, where the bride’s side has to pay substantial dowries to the groom’s side at marriage, but a positive impact in Korea, where, as in China, the groom’s side has to bear a disproportionate share of marriage-related expenses including purchasing a house or condominium for the newlywed couple."

Building on research showing that marriage can provide important resources for obtaining needed health care, we suggest that racial and ethnic differences in marriage could explain persistent disparities in access. Using data from MEPS and NLSY we investigate the association between marriage and access to health care among men, and estimate the extent to which racial and ethnic differences in both the returns to marriage and marital rates explain differences in access and preventive service use. We find that marriage accounts for up to 24 % of racial and ethnic differences in access and preventive use. The returns to marriage for whites and blacks, however, are greater than that for Hispanics. We suggest that differences in spousal characteristics such as education and income could explain why whites and blacks benefit from marriage more than Hispanics. We find support for this hypothesis: differences in spousal characteristics account for up to 37 % of the gap in access and preventive use among married adults.

For this purpose, we performed a five-round experiment with 95 established real-life couples in Germany. In each round, the couples received the same total amount of money, but the relative allocation to the spouses differed and they had to agree on an irreversible private goods consumption pattern. We find that for the majority of the sample, the consumption choices depend on the spouses’ relative resources. While this suggests a rejection of income pooling at the mean, a substantial share of the couples do indeed pool their resources. Pooling behavior is more common among couples in which the spouses’ socioeconomic characteristics are more similar. In particular, traditional couples with distinct work division between the spouses are significantly less likely to pool their individual resources and treat any spouse’s income symmetrically. Conventional variables used to approximate income pooling are only loosely related to the behavior observed in our experiment."

Having a first-born daughter as compared with a first-born son increases the level of household expenditures on child and adult female clothing, and it reduces spending on games, toys and hobbies. This could be a reflection of a pure gender bias on behalf of the parents or a reflection of gender complementarities between parents’ and children’s expenditures. We find no robust evidence on gender differences in educational investment, measured by kindergarten expenditure. The analysed expenditure patterns suggest a so-far unexamined role of gender in child development. Parents in Poland seem to pay more attention to how girls look and favour boys with respect to activities and play, which could have consequences in adult life and contribute to sustaining gender inequalities and stereotypes."

The study relies on 2003–2013 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data. Accounting for a variety of personal demographic characteristics, as well as state and year fixed effects, we find that an increase in state-level unemployment rates is associated with an increase in enriching child–father time in families with small children (ages 0–4). However, there is heterogeneity in results by race, education and marital status, with results being statistically significant for white, married and college-educated fathers. Additionally, we find some evidence that an increase in unemployment rates is also associated with an increase in primary childcare for fathers in families with small children, as well as some declines in total time that fathers spend with older children. In contrast to this result, we find that mothers’ total time with children, as well as primary childcare time, is invariant to macroeconomic fluctuations in the labor market, however, as the unemployment rate goes up we do observe small declines in enriching time that white mothers in families with small children devote to enriching activities."

We use the last two waves of the Italian Time Use Survey to analyse whether children imitate the reading habits of their parents. As reading is crucial for continuous investment in human capital throughout a person’s life, it is important that children acquire the habit of reading. This habit may be developed through both cultural and educational transfers from parents to children, and through imitative behaviours. Imitation is of particular interest, as it suggests that parents can have a direct influence on the formation of their children’s preferences and habits, and that active policies promoting good parenting behaviours might therefore be desirable. We investigate the short-run imitative behaviour of children using a household fixed-effects model in which we identify the impact of the parents’ role model by exploiting the differences in the exposure of siblings to their parents’ example within the same household. We find robust evidence of the existence of an imitation effect: on the day of the survey, children were more likely to had read after seeing either their mother or their father reading."

We find that the divorce law increases the hazard rate of having the first child by 61 % for more educated women, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, length of marriage and the negative trend in fertility rates observed in Chile since the mid-1960s.

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we examine the role of the business cycle in divorce. To do so, we use a panel of 29 European countries covering the period from 1991 to 2012. We find the unemployment rate negatively affects the divorce rate, pointing to a pro-cyclical evolution of the divorce rate, even after controlling for socio-economic variables and unobservable characteristics that can vary by country, and/or over time. Results  indicate that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate involves almost 0.025 fewer divorces per thousand inhabitants. The impact is small, representing around 1.2 % of the average divorce rate in Europe during the period considered. Supplementary analysis, developed to explore a possible non-linear pattern, confirms a negative relationship between unemployment and divorce in European countries, with the inverse relationship being more pronounced in those countries with higher divorce rates."

In this paper, I show that child benefits are disproportionately used for savings assignable to children. I exploit a policy reform in a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of child benefits on savings. The results suggest a significant positive effect on long-term savings and weak evidence for effects on child-assignable consumption. I conclude that labeling effects should be considered carefully by policy makers, if not for nudging individuals, then to avoid affecting decisions unintentionally."

However, fathers lower their labor-force-participation rates in response to custody reform. The patterns in the data are most easily reconciled with models that emphasize shifts in bargaining power to one household member, which is likely the father in the case of joint-custody reform."

abstract,"Abstract The prevalence of chronic conditions among children has been rising in the past four decades. Despite the policy relevance and plausible mechanisms through which child disability and severe early life health conditions can impact subsequent maternal reproductive behavior, there has been limited investigation of this question particularly in the US. Child disability or severe early life health problems such as very preterm birth (VPTB) and very low birth weight (VLBW) can constrain household resources to have another child but may also increase parental demand for healthy children and modify allocation of resources between children. Empirical assessment of this question is complicated by unobservables such as maternal health and preferences. We examine whether giving birth to a child with disabilities or severe adverse birth outcomes including VPTB and VLBW impacts subsequent maternal fertility. We employ a mother fixed-effect duration model for maternal fertility over time as a function of the proportion of previously born children with disabilities/health conditions in order to account for time-invariant unobservables, using merged data from the 1993 National Health Interview Survey and 1995 National Survey of Family Growth. We find no evidence that having disabled children reduces subsequent live births when using the mother fixed-effect model, in contrast to the classical model using within and between mother variation which suggests a fertility decline. Similarly, we find no evidence that having VPTB or VLBW children reduces fertility. Overall, our findings indicate no impact of child disability or health conditions on subsequent maternal fertility. Additional analyses excluding women who may qualify for AFDC show overall a similar pattern of results, suggesting that the findings may be generalizable post the AFDC. Time-varying unobservables may still be at work, but they likely result in an opposite (negative) bias toward reduction in fertility."

We focus on Italy, a country that, similar to many other OECD countries, is experiencing both an increasing number of single-parent families (most of which are headed by mothers) and an increasing gender gap in children’s cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. By using a difference-in-differences specification comparing children’s outcomes in single- vs. two-parent families for boys compared to girls, we analyze the differential effect across gender of living with a single mother on both the amount of time spent studying and the amount of effort put into studying. Our analysis suggests that living in a single-mother family has a more detrimental effect on boys, though all children—regardless of gender—receive fewer parental inputs if they live with a single mother. The greater detrimental effect of living with a single mother for boys seems to be driven by less educated, less well-off families or families with working mothers."

Our estimates suggest that the monetary and non-monetary components enter additively into marriage surplus, but with gender-specific marginal rates of substitution: divorce hazard is more sensitive to the non-pecuniary dissatisfaction of the wife than to that of the husband; impacts of the monetary components are also gender-specific and highly non-linear.

Using panel data for 230 municipalities that spans the years 2001–2014, this paper examines the impacts of family benefits on the fertility rate in Korea. I use the fact that different municipalities began providing the family benefits at different times to estimate the impact of family benefits on fertility rates using a difference-in-differences approach. This study finds a positive effect of family benefits on total fertility rate. Moreover, it finds little evidence of an anticipatory response within municipalities that adopted the policy. Given that a 10 million Korean won increase in family benefits is associated with a 3.5% increase in the total fertility rate, an increase in family benefits of about 44 million Korean won per child would be required to raise the total fertility rate to a safe zone above 1.5 children per woman, where population declines are gradual and easily reversed."

abstract,"Abstract Foster care is a source of significant costs to both governments and foster children. Policies that provide income support to households potentially reduce entry into foster care via reducing child maltreatment and improving child behavior. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 (ARRA2009), the federal government expanded the earned income tax credit (EITC), which is an important income support program for low-income working households. Using state-level data, we investigate the impact of this EITC expansion on state-level foster care entry rates. Typically, states with state-level EITC match federal EITC spending at a specific rate, meaning that increases in federal EITC spending increase state-level spending as well. We find that expansion of EITC decreased foster care entry rates by 7.43% per year in states with a state-level EITC, relative to those without. In models that separately examine foster care entry rates by age of the child, we find that the ARRA2009 had different effects on foster care entry based on the child’s age. We find that ARRA2009 decreased foster care entry rates for children age 11–15 by nearly 12% in states with a state EITC and it decreased foster care entry rates for children age 16–20 by roughly 17% in states with a state EITC, relative to states without a state EITC."

I detect a significant negative effect of this change in the parental leave system on the socio-emotional development of newborns and it turns out that children from loser-families drive this effect. The parental leave reform does not have a significant impact on 2–3-year-olds’ skills and development on average and the difference between children from losers and winners does also not persist in the longer run. I only find suggestive evidence that an increase in benefits improves some skills of 2–3-year-olds if compared to those who experience reductions in benefits."

abstract,"Abstract The practice of dowry is often thought to be the root cause of the unequal treatment of girls in India, as represented by sex-selective abortion and female infanticide. This is because the prospect of burdensome dowry payments in future makes the birth of a girl child unwelcome. For adult women without inheritance rights, however, dowry may function as their only source of protection. Using a nationwide dataset and exploiting a natural experimental setting, this study explores the relationship between dowry and women’s empowerment in India, a society where women do not have inheritance rights, and thus do not usually possess immovable assets. In such a society, dowry seems to enhance women’s status in the marital household. The relationship reverses when women have equal inheritance rights as their brothers. Empirical analysis suggests that the outright ban on dowry that ignores the context may not necessarily benefit women. It also implies that dowry may become unnecessary and disappear once women are assured of inheritance rights."

By controlling for a number of individual and family characteristics, we find that impatient individuals are more likely to experience divorce. The effect is robust to different specifications of our model and is not affected by reverse causality problems. We also find that the more risk averse individuals are, the less likely they are to experience divorce."

My strategy involves comparing international marriage premiums received by two groups of Mexican immigrants who arrived before and after the cutoff date of eligibility. Both groups face similar language and culture related obstacles and have to adapt themselves to the new environment, except that unauthorized Mexican workers who arrived before 1982 could obtain legal status through the amnesty while those who arrived after the cutoff date obtained legal status through marriage to a US citizen. Instrumental variables estimates show a significantly larger intermarriage premium for Mexican immigrants who migrated after the cutoff date and no statistically significant intermarriage premium is found in the pre-1982 group. The 35 % premium gap indicates a large effect of intermarriage on immigrant labor market outcomes, operating primarily through an improvement of legal status."

A simple decomposition reveals that this is mainly driven by the substantial rise in the emancipation rate among the full-time employed workers during the bust. To explain this change we discuss several factors such as macroeconomic conditions, rental subsidy policy, higher labor mobility, selection bias, reverse causation, time-lag in adjustment and secular trend."

The model predicts that the biological traits of same-sex couples, unlike those of heterosexual couples, should not be correlated—holding constant other household production characteristics. In addition, the model predicts that heterosexuals have a higher probability of having children and getting married, and that childless heterosexuals are less likely to engage in behaviors not complementary with children than childless gays and lesbians. Using two nationally representative probability samples that self-identify sexual orientation, these predictions are confirmed."

No statistically significant changes in paid work participation or hours are apparent for fathers of the same children. We find, moreover, evidence that the degree of specialization within families increases when there is a child with a disability. These responses are consistent with traditional gender roles within families, and may make sense as a ‘household’ coping strategy. However, such a division of labor may generate economic vulnerability for mothers compared to fathers."

Subgroup analyses show that the positive effects are much stronger for mothers with low wage potential, a group of mothers that were less likely to use formal childcare prior to the reform. The positive effects for this subgroup of mothers suggest that expanding child-care can be an effective tool for increasing labor supply of mothers who previously had relatively low labor market earnings potential."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper we present an alternative explanation of multiple job holdings. It is based on a behavioral portfolio approach using prospect theory. Multiple job holdings is often a result of economic hardship but also because of peer comparisons. Workers may decide to take on a risky job like self-employment and engage into new ventures but also hold on to a safe employment in order to stay as close as possible to their reference level. While multiple job holdings might be the case for some, many others might decide to keep on working only at a safe job and do not engage into new risky ventures. This paper presents a behavioral economics model to explain such decisions. We find that the decision to hold multiple jobs depends on the degree of loss aversion, the value of the reference level and on the expected return in the risky venture. The worker will not seek for a risky job if she has an income reference level equal to what she can earn from a safe job. At any other reference level, the worker will seek new ventures provided she is compensated with a higher expected wage and is sufficiently loss averse."

We propose an aggregate measure of employment deprivation among households that follows a methodological framework developed to measure wellbeing. This index verifies a set of reasonable axioms that other available measures do not: increases in three relevant employment deprivation elements-incidence, intensity and inequality. Incidence captures how many households in a population are touched by a lack of employment, while employment deprivation intensity reflects how far households are, on average, from being non-deprived of employment. Finally, employment deprivation inequality increases with the concentration of unemployment among few households. Based on this index, we analyze employment deprivation across the European Union using information from Labor Force Surveys during the current “Great Recession.” Our results provide evidence on the relevance of incorporating the household dimension to identify unemployment profiles, with a variety of implications, in terms of household wellbeing. Specifically, we show that countries with similar (intermediate) unemployment rates differ in their patterns of employment deprivation once the structure of employment across households is incorporated."

How large are the economies of scale of living together? And how do partners share their resources? The first question is usually answered by equivalence scales which assume equal sharing of resources within the household. Recent evidence based on collective household models rejects this equal sharing assumption. This paper uses data on financial satisfaction to simultaneously estimate the sharing rule and the economies of scale in a collective household model. The estimates indicate substantial scale economies of living together. Furthermore, wives receive on average almost 50 % of household resources, but the estimated shares vary between 30 and 60 %. Female resource shares increase with the ratio of female to male wages. Consumption inequality is underestimated by 16 % if unequal sharing is ignored."

We examine the effect of paid work in terms of the effect that total work time on a given day has on the amount of time spent on childcare; the allocation of time on activities across work and non-work days; and the effect of non-traditional work hours. The results show that mothers perform a large share of childcare, irrespective of their earning power or their partner’s availability to take on some of these tasks. The use of formal and informal childcare by others allows the mother to balance the competing demands of work and her own childcare; an effect that does not hold for fathers. These effects on childcare are also almost solely concentrated in the routine component of childcare (e.g. preparing meals, changing nappies), with each parent ‘protecting’ interactive childcare from the effect of both paid work and the relative availability of their partner to take on some of this childcare."

China launched a pension program for rural residents in 2009, now covering more than 300 million Chinese. This program offers a unique setting for studying the ageing population, given the rapidity of China’s population ageing, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level
. This paper examines whether receipt of the old-age pension payment equips elderly parents and their adult children to live apart and whether parents substitute children’s time involved in instrumental support to them with service consumption. Employing a regression discontinuity design to a primary longitudinal survey conducted in Guizhou province of China, this paper overcomes challenges in the literature that households eligible for pension payment might be systematically different from ineligible households and that it is difficult to separate the effect of pension from that of age or cohort heterogeneity. Around the pension eligibility age cut-off, results reveal large and significant reduction in intergenerational co-residence of the extended family and increase in service consumption among elderly parents.

abstract,"Abstract This paper uses retrospective micro data from eleven European countries to investigate the role of paternal retirement in explaining children’s decisions to leave the parental home.
 To assess causality, I use a bivariate discrete-time hazard model with shared frailty and exploit over time and cross-country variation in early retirement legislation. Overall, the results indicate a positive and significant influence of paternal retirement on the probability of first nest-leaving of children residing in Southern European countries, for both sons and daughters. Focusing on Southern Europe, I find that the increase in children’s nest-leaving around the time of paternal retirement does not appear to be justified by changes in parental resources. Rather, channels involving the supply of informal child care provided by grandparents or the quality of the home should be the focus of study."

abstract,"Abstract This paper argues that some women in developing countries use domestic labor as a tool to incentivize husbands. A theoretical model is derived based on the traditions of rural Malawi, where men often supplement farm income with wage labor. As wage labor is not observed by the wife, this creates moral hazard: husbands may not make enough effort to bring home wages. The model predicts that women overcome this by using domestic labor as an incentive device: they increase their domestic labor and reduce their leisure in response to good consumption outcomes, but only if they cannot rely on divorce threat as an alternative source of incentives. This prediction is confirmed using survey data from Malawi. Identification is based on the fact that Malawi’s kinship traditions exogenously determine women’s accessibility to divorce. Where divorce is not an option, women make inefficient labor choices in order to provide incentives."

abstract,"Abstract We investigate factors affecting the duration of eating and food preparation among adults in single decision-maker households. Eating time is differentiated into primary and secondary eating time and further differentiated by location: at home versus away from home. We construct a simple theoretical model, based on Becker’s household production approach, to motivate empirical equations for eating and food preparation time. Empirical analysis is performed using data from the 2006 to 2008 Eating and Health Module of the American Time Use Survey. Higher food-at-home prices are found to be associated with more time in food preparation and primary eating at home. Higher fast food prices are associated with more time in food preparation and less time in primary eating at home. We conclude that food prices influence home production and time allocation decisions. We also find that low-income adults spend more time in food preparation and primary eating at home and are less likely to eat away from home than those with more income. The presence of children in the household is associated with more time in food preparation and less time in primary eating away from home. Public policies attempting to effect an increase in food preparation among low-income, single adult households with children may need to account for limited opportunities such households can have to acquire and prepare healthier foods when additional time is required."

However, few studies have yet investigated the factors which may promote or inhibit breastfeeding practices in Japan. To fill this research gap, this paper uses data newly gathered in 2012 on breastfeeding initiation and duration for each child of each mother, which enable us to estimate mother fixed-effects models that control for unobserved differences among mothers. Compared to mothers who leave their jobs after childbirth, mothers who return to work within a year after childbirth do not significantly differ in breastfeeding initiation but have a breastfeeding duration which is shorter by 1.654 months. On the other hand, when fathers work under a flextime system after childbirth, breastfeeding initiation is higher, and the duration is longer by 4.418 months. Therefore, letting fathers work under a flextime system would help promote breastfeeding practices in Japan."

After accounting for selection on observables via propensity score matching and selection on unobservables via family fixed effects and instrumental variables approaches, we find that teen motherhood is negatively related to adult civic engagement. Descriptive evidence suggests that teen birth-induced reductions in educational attainment and the time-intensive nature of childcare are important mechanisms. Finally, we find that while the adverse civic engagement effects of teen parenthood may extend to teen fathers, the effects are much smaller in magnitude."

The higher BMI is not necessarily healthy because the boys are more likely to be in the overweight range and less likely to be in the normal range. I also find evidence that risk averse mothers spend more on their son’s schooling related expenditures such as materials, uniforms, and spending money. A comparison of siblings reveals a gender gap in child investments that is increasing in maternal risk aversion."

The analysis allows for intra-family and gender-specific effects. We find that among men, becoming unemployed initially has a favorable impact on smoking behavior, including a decreased likelihood of a smoking relapse and decreased cigarette consumption. However among men who are unemployed long term, some of these favorable effects attenuate. Among women, we find that becoming unemployed initially has a small impact on quitting smoking. However, being unemployed long term decreases their likelihood of quitting smoking. The perceived risk of unemployment has very little impact on men but affects women’s smoking behavior. Results  indicate that women experiencing an increase in their state’s unemployment rate are more likely to change their smoking behavior favorably."

Two main results emerge. First, we find strong and robust evidence that households hit by an employment shock do respond by increasing labor supply. Second, we document an added worker effect that is affecting not only wives, but also teenage children and students independently of their age, with important policy implications in terms of human capital formation. Results  are robust across gender, household financial conditions and the crisis, yet they do not point to differential reactions along these dimensions."

abstract,"Abstract This paper analyzes the relationship between parents’ time devoted to housework and the time devoted to housework by their children. Using data from the Multinational Time Use Study for the UK, we find positive intergenerational correlations in housework for both parents, indicating that the more time parents devote to housework, the more time their children will devote to housework. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we find that a higher father–mother housework ratio is positively related to a higher child–mother housework ratio, even after allowing for individual fixed-effects. In order to address the potential exacerbation of errors-in-variables arising from the fixed-effects specification, we instrument the father–mother ratio of housework using father’s and mother’s lagged weekly working hours. The Instrumental-Variable estimates fully support the fixed-effects estimates, and suggest that the latter should be regarded as a lower bound. We also present evidence of the link between housework during adolescence and during adulthood, which may indicate that housework time during adulthood depends on the housework time during childhood, which may also be affected by parents’ housework time. Our results contribute to the field of the intergenerational mobility of behaviors."

However, little is known about how taxes affect the labor supply decisions of this population. This paper provides an initial investigation, studying the impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansions of the early 1990s on the labor supply of adult dependents living with their relatives. I find that dependent individuals who were not a part of the nuclear family responded to the EITC expansions, increasing labor force participation by about 5 percentage points. For adult children, I show that the absence of a net response is likely due to an unexpected consequence of the EITC: expanded family credits led to a decrease in their labor force participation."

abstract,"Abstract Despite broad progress in closing many dimensions of the gender gap around the globe, recent research has shown that traditional gender roles can still exert a large influence on female labor force participation, even in developed economies. This paper empirically analyzes the role of culture in determining the labor market engagement of women within the context of collective models of household decision making. In particular, we use the epidemiological approach to study the relationship between gender in language and labor market participation among married female immigrants to the U.S. We show that the presence of gender in language can act as a marker for culturally acquired gender roles and that these roles are important determinants of household labor allocations. Female immigrants who speak a language with sex-based grammatical rules exhibit lower labor force participation, hours worked, and weeks worked. Our strategy of isolating one component of culture reveals that roughly two thirds of this relationship can be explained by correlated cultural factors, including the role of bargaining power in the household, and the impact of ethnic enclaves and that at most one third is potentially explained by language having a causal impact."

abstract,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that recessions are typically associated with better health and health behaviors. With the exception of a few recent studies however, these studies focus on sample periods that end prior to the Great Recession. The few exceptions that extend the analysis period beyond the Great Recession suggest that the pro-cyclical relationship between macroeconomic conditions and mortality obtained in earlier studies might have weakened over time. In this paper, we revisited the relationship between state unemployment rate and a large set of outcomes of health and health behaviors using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) between 1990 and 2014. Overall, our results suggest that state unemployment rate is weakly related to both health and health behaviors as our estimates are too small to have any meaningful implications, although they are largely imprecisely estimated. Finally, we tested whether the Great Recession played a significant role in influencing the pattern in the relationship between unemployment rate and health and health behaviors. Our results from this analysis do not reveal any measurable recession effect, although the estimates are again largely imprecise."

We find that overall wealth dropped by 15 percent between 2008 and 2011, with losses concentrating among households in the mid and top wealth quintiles. The most hard hit wealth components were business assets, primary home equity, and durable assets, which declined by 40 percent, 23 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Wealth losses among all households were likely sustained by restricted access to credit. Nonetheless, in part due to their more diversified wealth portfolios, households in the top wealth quintile amassed a greater share of the country’s wealth during the recession. Consequently, wealth inequality, which receded during the expansionary years of 2002 through 2005, rose by 2008 and continued its trend in 2011."

abstract,"Abstract In the mid-1990s Mexican states began adopting reforms that for the first time criminalized domestic violence. Two separate policies were also adopted which allowed domestic violence to be grounds for divorce and established prevention and assistance programs for victims of domestic violence. I exploit the variation in time and geography to estimate the impact of these three policies on female suicide rates using a difference-in-difference methodology. The results indicate that states that criminalized domestic violence exhibited a 22–34% decrease in suicide rates compared to non-adopting states, but there is no robust evidence that the other two policies had any impact. A battery of tests provides support for the robustness of these findings and indicates that most of the effects are concentrated among married women. Analysis of a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey covering violence against women in Mexico suggests reduction in sexual and physical violence as a possible mechanism behind the reduction in female suicide rates. These findings are consistent with an intra-household bargaining model with asymmetric information and costly conflict which predicts that policies that reduce conflict within the household can reduce female suicides. The results highlight the importance of developing and implementing policies that facilitate reporting and providing access to legal institutions for victims of domestic violence, which can in turn improve a victim’s wellbeing."

A fixed-effects analysis of data from the Child and Young Adult file of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth shows that, conditional upon receipt of some amount of child support, higher payment levels are associated with significantly greater odds of having private health insurance coverage and significantly lower odds of poor or declining health status. These effects persist even after controlling for other factors that are likely to be correlated with child support payments, including total family income and paternal visitation patterns."

Results  from the panel IV estimations suggest that having a high mortgage loan to home value (LTV), defined as LTV at or above 80 %, leads to more depressive symptoms and a higher incidence of hypertension, but has no effect on subjective well-being. Since the results from panel estimations did not show that debt affects health, whether the panel IV results demonstrate a causal relationship depends critically on the exclusion assumption."

Two veteran cohorts are examined, those who served during the early twenty-first century wars and those who served during the early 1980s. Among my results, the former cohort is shown to have had their divorce probability increased in the first 2 years post-service, while the opposite effect is found for the latter cohort. Unlike many previous studies of military service and marital stability, I find that effects are not overly dissimilar across racial groups."

We do find, however, that for those gay men who are self-employed, there is little evidence of a further earnings penalty, at least among full-time workers. Lesbians earn at least as much as married women, but receive no further earnings premium—or penalty—by being self-employed, again among full-time workers."

In this study, we examine how the receipt of public and private food assistance is associated with regular family routines, using longitudinal data on low-income families with children from the Three City Study. Estimates from fixed-effects regression models indicate that WIC participation is positively associated with homework routines and consistent bed times. However, receipt of other assistance is not strongly associated with family routines."

This relationship between work and quality time does not vary much based on mothers’ education and is robust to the inclusion of family or child fixed effects.

The aim of this paper is to determine whether there are factors other than income or education that can explain the larger number of children in Spanish Roma families. Our analysis reveals that the existence of a family business, which is highly labor-demanding, appears to be associated with parental decisions concerning the number of children. Since parental authority, in Roma families, holds sway over children even after their own marriage, the future labor contributions of children are particularly beneficial to the family business."

We show that a one yen decrease in discretionary income due to tuition payment is associated with 0.1–0.2 yen decrease in non-tuition spending in the month of tuition payment, showing that those households are not engaged in consumption smoothing."

The global effect of child mortality on total and net fertility is found to be positive. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide evidence for the child survival hypothesis—an effect of child mortality on net fertility—at the micro level. We further identify an inverted-U shaped relationship between child mortality and net fertility. The implication is that health policies aiming at reducing child mortality have indirect effects on desired fertility; yet only a steep decrease in child mortality would be likely to trigger fertility declines."

abstract,"Abstract Previous studies, mostly from Anglo-Saxon countries, find a positive correlation between the presence of young children in the household and self-employment probabilities among women. This has been seen as an indication of women with young children choosing self-employment as a way of balancing work and family commitments. This paper studies the relationship between children and female self-employment in a country with family friendly policies and a generous welfare system: Sweden. The initial hypothesis is that we will not find evidence of a positive effect of children on self-employment among Swedish women since there are other institutions in place aiming at facilitating the combination of work and family. Using Swedish register data for the period 2004–2008 we do, however, find that the presence of young children increases the probability of choosing self-employment also among Swedish women. The effect is strongest for women with very young children, 0–3 years of age. These results also hold in a panel data model that takes individual unobserved heterogeneity into account. We also analyze time-use data and find, contrary to what has been found in many other countries, that self-employed women spend more, or as much, time on market work than wage-earning women. This raises doubts about whether women in Sweden chose self-employment as a way of balancing work and family commitments."

abstract,"Abstract Early care and education (ECE) enables parental employment and provides a context for child development. Theory suggests that lower child care costs, through subsidized care or the provision of free or low-cost arrangements, would increase the use of ECE and parents’ employment and work hours. This paper reviews the research literature examining the effects of child care costs and availability on parental employment. In general, research suggests that reduced out-of-pocket costs for ECE and increased availability of public ECE increases ECE attendance among young children, and has positive impacts on mothers’ labor force participation and work hours. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in findings. Among U.S. studies that report the elasticity of employment to ECE price, estimates range from −0.025 to −1.1, with estimates clustering near 0.05–0.25. This indicates that a 10 % reduction in the price of child care would lead to a 0.25–11 % increase in maternal employment, likely near 0.5–2.5 %. In general, studies using more recent data or data from non-U.S. countries find smaller elasticities than those using U.S. data from the 1990s. These differences may be due to historical and cross-national differences in ECE attendance, labor force attachment, and educational attainment among mothers with young children, as well as heterogeneity in the methodological approaches and data used across studies. More research in the U.S. using contemporary data is needed, particularly given recent changes in U.S. ECE policy."

abstract,"Abstract Previous research finds adverse effects of nontraditional family structures on cognitive and educational outcomes, but less is known about potential impacts on health. We use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine two health statuses (self-reported overall health and depression) and one health behavior (smoking), estimating both static logit models of point-in-time health and discrete-time hazard models of health transitions. Overall, we find adverse associations between nontraditional family structures and health statuses and behavior. There are long-lasting associations of family structure with outcomes well into adulthood, not all of which are evident in adolescence. Dynamic estimates often inform but also provide new information not seen in the static model. “Unpacking” the family structure variables by period of childhood provides insight into how the timing of family break-ups affects the life trajectories of health and health behavior. Our findings differ remarkably by gender. Girls’ health appears more sensitive to family structure than boys’. In combination with prior findings in the literature, our findings intriguingly suggest that family break-ups and changes affect boys mostly through cognitive, educational, and emotional channels, while girls are most affected in their health and health behaviors. A major methodological contribution of this study is better measurement of family structure. We find that many adverse associations are masked by cruder measures in typical use."

abstract,"Abstract Against the background of rapid population ageing, studying social participation in later life is of particular relevance within the framework of active ageing. Although caring for grandchildren has taken a central role for older persons due to unprecedented overlap between grandparents’ and their grandchildren’s lives, whether the relationship between grandparental childcare and social activities is characterised by cumulation or competition remains under-explored. Grandparental childcare may increase the purpose in life for grandparents, stimulating their social participation, or it may impose time and energy constraints on it. This study aims to assess the effect of providing grandchild care on participation in social activities for people aged 50–85 in Europe. Using an instrumental variable approach on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we find no significant negative effects of grandchild care on engagement in at least one social activity. However, regular provision of grandchild care has a significant negative effect on the number of activities in which grandmothers participate. When considering the activities separately by type we also find, for grandmothers only, a negative effect on volunteering, engagement in educational or training courses and participation in political or community-related organisation."

abstract,"Abstract 
This paper examines the effect of local economic growth on whether young adults move out of the parental home to form new households—an important milestone in the transition to adulthood. I use the placement of foreign direct investment during the Celtic Tiger, the large economic expansion in Ireland during the 1990s, to estimate the impact of local job growth on the likelihood that young adults leave home. This paper contributes to the literature by exploiting an exogenous shock to the local labor market to identify the main effect of employment growth on home leaving behavior. The results show that local economic growth increases the probability that young adults leave home particularly for the well-educated young adults most likely to be employed in the factories that opened during the period."

abstract,"Abstract A growing literature in economics has examined the effect of early childhood health investments on adult human capital formation and labor market outcomes. This study is the first to examine the effect of having been breastfed as an infant on young adult earnings. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), ordinary least squares estimates suggest that breastfeeding is associated with a 10–12 % increase in hourly earnings. However, after ensuring common support on observables via propensity score matching and controlling for unmeasured family level heterogeneity common to siblings via family fixed effects, the estimated associations become much smaller and are statistically indistinguishable from zero. We conclude that the benefits of having been breastfed do not appear to extend to the labor market."

abstract,"Abstract This study employs a single framework for investigating both environmental journalistic texts published on news websites, and science teachers’ choices of such texts for their teaching. We analyzed 188 environmental items published during 2 months in seven news websites to determine popularity of topics. Then, 64 science junior high school teachers responded to a closed questionnaire to identify their preferred topics for using in the classroom and patterns of using environmental news items. In a second, open-ended questionnaire, responded by 50 teachers, we investigated the teachers’ media literacy in terms of identifying text types and writers of environmental news items. Good alignment was found between the published topics on the websites and teachers’ choices, with somewhat different distribution of topics, which could be explained by curriculum requirements. Teachers’ identification of text types and writer types was inaccurate, which implied that their media literacy is inadequate. We argue that media literacy is required for effective use of journalistic texts in science teaching."

abstract,"Abstract Web-based learning is a growing field in education, yet empirical research into the design of high quality Web-based university science instruction is scarce. A one-week asynchronous online module on the Bohr Model of the atom was developed and implemented guided by the knowledge integration framework. The unit design aligned with three identified metaprinciples of science learning: making science accessible, making thinking visible, and promoting autonomy. Students in an introductory chemistry course at a large east coast university completed either an online module or traditional classroom instruction. Data from 99 students were analyzed and results showed significant knowledge growth in both online and traditional formats. For the online learning group, findings revealed positive student perceptions of their learning experiences, highly positive feedback for online science learning, and an interest amongst students to learn chemistry within an online environment."

abstract,"Abstract Manipulative environments play a fundamental role in inquiry-based science learning, yet how they impact learning is not fully understood. In a series of two studies, we develop the argument that manipulative environments (MEs) influence the kind of inquiry behaviors students engage in, and that this influence realizes through the affordances of MEs, independent of whether they are physical or virtual. In particular, we examine how MEs shape college students’ experimentation strategies and conceptual understanding. In study 1, students engaged in two consecutive inquiry tasks, first on mass and spring systems and then on electric circuits. They either used virtual or physical MEs. We found that the use of experimentation strategies was strongly related to conceptual understanding across tasks, but that students engaged differently in those strategies depending on what ME they used. More students engaged in productive strategies using the virtual ME for electric circuits, and vice versa using the physical ME for mass and spring systems. In study 2, we isolated the affordance of measurement uncertainty by comparing two versions of the same virtual ME for electric circuits—one with and one without noise—and found that the conditions differed in terms of productive experimentation strategies. These findings indicate that measures of inquiry processes may resolve apparent ambiguities and inconsistencies between studies on MEs that are based on learning outcomes alone."

abstract,"Abstract Argumentation has been emphasized in recent US science education reform efforts (NGSS Lead States 2013; NRC 2012), and while existing studies have investigated approaches to introducing and supporting argumentation (e.g., McNeill and Krajcik in Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 45(1), 53–78, 2008; Kang et al. in Science Education, 98(4), 674–704, 2014), few studies have investigated how game-based approaches may be used to introduce argumentation to students. In this paper, we report findings from a design-based study of a teacher’s use of a computer game intended to introduce the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework (McNeill and Krajcik 2012) for scientific argumentation. We studied the implementation of the game over two iterations of development in a high school biology teacher’s classes. The results of this study include aspects of enactment of the activities and student argument scores. We found the teacher used the game in aspects of explicit instruction of argumentation during both iterations, although the ways in which the game was used differed. Also, students’ scores in the second iteration were significantly higher than the first iteration. These findings support the notion that students can learn argumentation through a game, especially when used in conjunction with explicit instruction and support in student materials. These findings also highlight the importance of analyzing classroom implementation in studies of game-based learning."

abstract,"Abstract This study investigates the convergence of multiliteracies and scientific practices in a fifth grade classroom. As students’ lives become increasingly multimodal, diverse, and globalized, the traditional notions of literacy must be revisited (New London Group 1996). With the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013a) in many states, either in their entirety or in adapted forms, it becomes useful to explore the interconnectedness multiliteracies and scientific practices and the resulting implications for scientific literacy. The case study included a fifth grade classroom, including the students and teacher. In order to create a rich description of the cases involved, data were collected and triangulated through teacher interviews, student interviews and focus groups, and classroom observations. Findings reveal that as science activities were enriched with multiliteracies and scientific practices, students were engaged in developing skills and knowledge central to being scientifically literate. Furthermore, this study establishes that characteristics of scientific literacy, by its intent and purpose, are a form of multiliteracies in elementary classrooms. Therefore, the teaching and learning of science and its practices for scientific literacy are in turn reinforcing the development of broader multiliteracies."

The grant itself focused on the use of serious educational games (SEGs) in the science classroom, both during and after school, to teach science content and affect student perceptions of science and technology. This study consists of a Bayesian artificial neural network analysis, using the preintervention measures of affect, interest, personality, and cognitive ability, in members of both the treatment and comparison groups to generate the probabilities that students would opt into the treatment group or choose not to participate. It appears, from this sample and the sampling methods of other related studies within the field, that despite sometimes profound results from technology interventions in science, interventions are affecting only those who already have a strong interest in STEM due to the manner in which participants are recruited."

abstract,"Abstract Smartphones as experimental tools (SETs) offer inspiring possibilities for science education, as their built-in sensors allow many different measurements, but until now, there has been little research that studies this approach. Due to current interest in their development, it seems necessary to provide empirical evidence about potential effects of SETs by a well-controlled study. For the present investigation, experiments were developed that use the smartphones’ acceleration sensors to investigate an important topic of classical mechanics (pendulum). A quasi-experimental repeated-measurement design, consisting of an experimental group using SETs (smartphone group, SG, NSG = 87) and a control group working with traditional experimental tools (CG, NCG = 67), was used to study the effects on interest, curiosity, and learning achievement. Moreover, various control variables were taken into account. With multiple-regression analyses and ANCOVA, we found significantly higher levels of interest in the SG (small to medium effect size). Pupils that were less interested at the beginning of the study profited most from implementing SETs. Moreover, the SG showed higher levels of topic-specific curiosity (small effect size). No differences were found for learning achievement. This means that the often-supposed cognitive disadvantage of distracting learners with technological devices did not lead to reduced learning, whereas interest and curiosity were apparently fostered. Moreover, the study contributes evidence that could reduce potential concerns related to classroom use of smartphones and similar devices (increased cognitive load, mere novelty effect). In sum, the study presents encouraging results for the under-researched topic of SET use in science classrooms."

abstract,"Abstract Currently, there is significant interest being directed towards the development of STEM education to meet economic and societal demands. While economic concerns can be a powerful driving force in advancing the STEM agenda, care must be taken that such economic imperative does not promote research approaches that overemphasize pragmatic application at the expense of augmenting the fundamental knowledge base of the discipline. This can be seen in the predominance of studies investigating problem solving approaches and procedures, while neglecting representational and conceptual processes, within the literature. Complementing concerns about STEM graduates’ problem solving capabilities, raised within the pertinent literature, this paper discusses a novel methodological approach aimed at investigating the cognitive elements of problem conceptualization. The intention is to demonstrate a novel method of data collection that overcomes some of the limitations cited in classic problem solving research while balancing a search for fundamental understanding with the possibility of application. The methodology described in this study employs an electroencephalographic (EEG) headset, as part of a mixed methods approach, to gather objective evidence of students’ cognitive processing during problem solving epochs. The method described provides rich evidence of students’ cognitive representations of problems during episodes of applied reasoning. The reliability and validity of the EEG method is supported by the stability of the findings across the triangulated data sources. The paper presents a novel method in the context of research within STEM education and demonstrates an effective procedure for gathering rich evidence of cognitive processing during the early stages of problem conceptualization."

abstract,"Abstract Engaging in argumentation from evidence is challenging for most middle school students. We report the design of a media-based mentoring system to support middle school students in engaging in argumentation in the context of a game-infused science curriculum. Our design emphasizes learners apprenticing with college student mentors around the socio-scientific inquiry of a designed video game. We report the results of a mixed-methods study examining the use of this media-based mentoring system with students ages 11 through 14. We observed that the discourse of groups of students that engaged with the game-infused science curriculum while interacting with college student mentors via a social media platform demonstrated statistically significant higher ratings of cognitive, epistemic, and social aspects of argumentation than groups of students that engaged with the social media platform and game-infused science curriculum without mentors. We further explored the differences between the Discourses of the mentored and non-mentored groups. This analysis showed that students in the mentored groups were invited, guided, and socialized into roles of greater agency than students in the non-mentored groups. This increased agency might explain why mentored groups demonstrated higher levels of scientific argumentation than non-mentored groups. Based on our analyses, we argue that media-based mentoring may be designed around a video game to support middle school students in engaging in argumentation from evidence."

abstract,"Abstract Extensive research has shown that one of the benefits of programming to learn about scientific phenomena is that it facilitates learning about mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. However, using programming activities in classrooms is associated with costs such as requiring additional time to learn to program or students needing prior experience with programming. This paper presents a class of programming environments that we call quickstart: Environments with a negligible threshold for entry into programming and a modest ceiling. We posit that such environments can provide benefits of programming for learning without incurring associated costs for novice programmers. To make this claim, we present a design-based research study conducted to compare programming models of evolutionary processes with a quickstart toolkit with exploring pre-built models of the same processes. The study was conducted in six seventh grade science classes in two schools. Students in the programming condition used EvoBuild, a quickstart toolkit for programming agent-based models of evolutionary processes, to build their NetLogo models. Students in the exploration condition used pre-built NetLogo models. We demonstrate that although students came from a range of academic backgrounds without prior programming experience, and all students spent the same number of class periods on the activities including the time students took to learn programming in this environment, EvoBuild students showed greater learning about evolutionary mechanisms. We discuss the implications of this work for design research on programming environments in K-12 science education."

abstract,"Abstract Elementary teachers often hold inaccurate beliefs about the Nature of Science (NoS) and have negative attitudes toward science and mathematics. Using a pre-post design, the current study examined beliefs about the NoS, attitudes toward science and mathematics, and beliefs about the teaching of mathematics and science in a large sample study (N = 343) of pre-service teachers receiving a curriculum-wide intervention to improve these factors in comparison with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM majors in other physics courses (N = 6697) who did not receive the intervention, over a 10-year period. Pre-service teachers evidenced initially more negative attitudes about mathematics and science than STEM majors and slightly more positive attitudes than non-STEM majors. Their attitudes toward mathematics and science and beliefs about the NoS were more similar to non-STEM than STEM majors. Pre-service teachers initially evidenced more positive beliefs about the teaching of mathematics and science, and their beliefs even increased slightly over the course of the semester, while these beliefs in other groups remained the same. Beliefs about the NoS and the teaching of mathematics and science were significantly negatively correlated for STEM and non-STEM majors, but were not significantly correlated for pre-service teachers. Beliefs about the NoS and attitudes toward mathematics and science were significantly positively correlated for both pre-service teachers and STEM students pursing the most mathematically demanding STEM majors. Attitudes toward science and mathematics were significantly positively correlated with accurate beliefs about the teaching of mathematics and science for all student groups."

history,"['2018-04', '2017-11-08']"
abstract,"Abstract The coupling of the traditional classroom instruction and a virtual learning environment (VLE) in an engineering course is critical to stimulating the learning process and to encouraging students to develop competencies outside of the classroom. This can be achieved through planned activities and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), resources designed to complement students’ autonomous learning needs. A quantitative analysis of students’ academic performance using final course grades was performed for a fundamentals of electronics course and we examine students’ perception of their autonomy using surveys. The students’ progress and attitudes were monitored over four consecutive semesters. The first began with the design of the intervention and the following three consisted in the implementation. The strategy was focused on the development of course competencies through autonomous learning with ICT tools presented in the VLE. Findings indicate that the students who did the activities in the VLE showed an increase in performance scores in comparison with students who did not do them. The strategy used in this study, which enhanced perceived autonomy, was associated with a positive effect on their learning process. This research shows that a technology-enhanced course supported by ICT activities can both improve academic performance and foster autonomy in students."

abstract,"Abstract This study with 79 students in Montreal, Quebec, compared the educational use of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) global climate model (GCM) to climate education technologies developed for classroom use that included simpler interfaces and processes. The goal was to show how differing climate education technologies succeed and fail at getting students to evolve in their understanding of anthropogenic global climate change (AGCC). Many available climate education technologies aim to convey key AGCC concepts or Earth systems processes; the educational GCM used here aims to teach students the methods and processes of global climate modeling. We hypothesized that challenges to learning about AGCC make authentic technology-enabled inquiry important in developing accurate understandings of not just the issue but how scientists research it. The goal was to determine if student learning trajectories differed between the comparison and treatment groups based on whether each climate education technology allowed authentic scientific research. We trace learning trajectories using pre/post exams, practice quizzes, and written student reflections. To examine the reasons for differing learning trajectories, we discuss student pre/post questionnaires, student exit interviews, and 535 min of recorded classroom video. Students who worked with a GCM demonstrated learning trajectories with larger gains, higher levels of engagement, and a better idea of how climate scientists conduct research. Students who worked with simpler climate education technologies scored lower in the course because of lower levels of engagement with inquiry processes that were perceived to not actually resemble the work of climate scientists."

abstract,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills."

abstract,"Abstract Engineering design thinking is hard to teach and still harder to learn by novices primarily due to the undetermined nature of engineering problems that often results in multiple solutions. In this paper, we investigate the effect of teaching engineering design thinking to freshmen students by using a computer-aided Design (CAD) simulation software. We present a framework for characterizing different levels of engineering design thinking displayed by students who interacted with the CAD simulation software in the context of a collaborative assignment. This framework describes the presence of four levels of engineering design thinking—beginning designer, adept beginning designer, informed designer, adept informed designer. We present the characteristics associated with each of these four levels as they pertain to four engineering design strategies that students pursued in this study—understanding the design challenge, building knowledge, weighing options and making tradeoffs, and reflecting on the process. Students demonstrated significant improvements in two strategies—understanding the design challenge and building knowledge. We discuss the affordances of the CAD simulation tool along with the learning environment that potentially helped students move towards Adept informed designers while pursuing these design strategies."

abstract,"Abstract We investigate the way students’ reasoning about evolution can be supported by drawing-based modeling. We modified the drawing-based modeling tool SimSketch to allow for modeling evolutionary processes. In three iterations of development and testing, students in lower secondary education worked on creating an evolutionary model. After each iteration, the user interface and instructions were adjusted based on students’ remarks and the teacher’s observations. Students’ conversations were analyzed on reasoning complexity as a measurement of efficacy of the modeling tool and the instructions. These findings were also used to compose a set of recommendations for teachers and curriculum designers for using and constructing models in the classroom. Our findings suggest that to stimulate scientific reasoning in students working with a drawing-based modeling, tool instruction about the tool and the domain should be integrated. In creating models, a sufficient level of scaffolding is necessary. Without appropriate scaffolds, students are not able to create the model. With scaffolding that is too high, students may show reasoning that incorrectly assigns external causes to behavior in the model."

abstract,"Abstract As science grows in complexity, science teachers face an increasing challenge of helping students interpret models that represent complex science systems. Little is known about how teachers select and use models when planning lessons. This mixed methods study investigated the pedagogical approaches and visual models used by elementary in-service and preservice teachers in the development of a science lesson about a complex system (e.g., water cycle). Sixty-seven elementary in-service and 69 elementary preservice teachers completed a card sort task designed to document the types of visual models (e.g., images) that teachers choose when planning science instruction. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to analyze the card sort task. Semistructured interviews were conducted with a subsample of teachers to elicit the rationale for image selection. Results  from this study showed that both experienced in-service teachers and novice preservice teachers tended to select similar models and use similar rationales for images to be used in lessons. Teachers tended to select models that were aesthetically pleasing and simple in design and illustrated specific elements of the water cycle. The results also showed that teachers were not likely to select images that represented the less obvious dimensions of the water cycle. Furthermore, teachers selected visual models more as a pedagogical tool to illustrate specific elements of the water cycle and less often as a tool to promote student learning related to complex systems."

abstract,"Abstract This study sought to develop a self-report instrument to be used in the assessment of the project competences of college students engaged in online project-based learning. Three scales of the KIPSSE instrument developed for this study, namely, the knowledge integration, project skills, and self-efficacy scales, were based on related theories and the analysis results of three project advisor interviews. Those items of knowledge integration and project skill scales focused on the integration of different disciplines and technological skills separately. Two samples of data were collected from information technology-related courses taught with an online project-based learning strategy over different semesters at a college in southern Taiwan. The validity and reliability of the KIPSSE instrument were confirmed through item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling of two samples of students’ online response sets separately. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient for the entire instrument was 0.931; for each scale, the alpha ranged from 0.832 to 0.907. There was also a significant correlation (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) between the KIPSSE instrument results and the students’ product evaluation scores. The findings of this study confirmed the validity and reliability of the KIPSSE instrument. The confirmation process and related implications are also discussed."

abstract,"Abstract We explored the scientific argumentation that occurs among university biology students during an argumentation task implemented in two environments: face-to-face in a classroom and online in an asynchronous discussion. We observed 10 student groups, each composed of three students. Our analysis focused on how students respond to their peers’ unscientific arguments, which we define as assertions, hypotheses, propositions, or explanations that are inaccurate or incomplete from a scientific perspective. Unscientific arguments provide opportunities for productive dissent, scientific argumentation, and conceptual development of scientifically desirable conceptions. We found that students did not respond to the majority of unscientific arguments in both environments. Challenges to unscientific arguments were expressed as a question or through explanation, although the latter was more common online than face-to-face. Students demonstrated significantly more epistemic distancing in the face-to-face environment than the online environment. We discuss the differences in discourse observed in both environments and teaching implications. We also provide direction for future research seeking to address the challenges of engaging students in productive scientific argumentation in both face-to-face and online environments."

abstract,"Abstract The National Research Council framework for science education and the Next Generation Science Standards have developed a need for additional research and development of curricula that is both technologically model-based and includes engineering practices. This is especially the case for biology education. This paper describes a quasi-experimental design study to test the effectiveness of a model-based curriculum focused on the concepts of natural selection and population ecology that makes use of Excel modeling tools (Modeling Instruction in Biology with Excel, MBI-E). The curriculum revolves around the bio-engineering practice of controlling an invasive species. The study takes place in the Midwest within ten high schools teaching a regular-level introductory biology class. A post-test was designed that targeted a number of common misconceptions in both concept areas as well as representational usage. The results of a post-test demonstrate that the MBI-E students significantly outperformed the traditional classes in both natural selection and population ecology concepts, thus overcoming a number of misconceptions. In addition, implementing students made use of more multiple representations as well as demonstrating greater fascination for science."

abstract,"Abstract Educational robotics (ER) is an innovative learning tool that offers students opportunities to develop higher-order thinking skills. This study investigates the development of students’ metacognitive (MC) and problem-solving (PS) skills in the context of ER activities, implementing different modes of guidance in two student groups (11–12 years old, N1 = 30, and 15-16 years old, N2 = 22). The students of each age group were involved in an 18-h group-based activity after being randomly distributed in two conditions: “minimal” (with minimal MC and PS guidance) and “strong” (with strong MC and PS guidance). Evaluations were based on the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory measuring students’ metacognitive awareness and on a think-aloud protocol asking students to describe the process they would follow to solve a certain robot-programming task. The results suggest that (a) strong guidance in solving problems can have a positive impact on students’ MC and PS skills and (b) students reach eventually the same level of MC and PS skills development independently of their age and gender."

abstract,"Abstract Computational tools and methods have permeated multiple science and engineering disciplines, because they enable scientists and engineers to process large amounts of data, represent abstract phenomena, and to model and simulate complex concepts. In order to prepare future engineers with the ability to use computational tools in the context of their disciplines, some universities have started to integrate these tools within core courses. This paper evaluates the effect of introducing three computational modules within a thermodynamics course on student disciplinary learning and self-beliefs about computation. The results suggest that using worked examples paired to computer simulations to implement these modules have a positive effect on (1) student disciplinary learning, (2) student perceived ability to do scientific computing, and (3) student perceived ability to do computer programming. These effects were identified regardless of the students’ prior experiences with computer programming."

history,['2018-01-24']
abstract,"Abstract Science and computational practices such as modeling and abstraction are critical to understanding the complex systems that are integral to climate science. Given the demonstrated affordances of game design in supporting such practices, we implemented a free 4-day intensive workshop for middle school girls that focused on using the visual programming environment, Scratch, to design games to teach others about climate change. The experience was carefully constructed so that girls of widely differing levels of experience were able to engage in a cycle of game design. This qualitative study aimed to explore the representational choices the girls made as they took up aspects of climate change systems and modeled them in their games. Evidence points to the ways in which designing games about climate science fostered emergent systems thinking and engagement in modeling practices as learners chose what to represent in their games, grappled with the realism of their respective representations, and modeled interactions among systems components. Given the girls’ levels of programming skill, parts of systems were more tractable to create than others. The educational purpose of the games was important to the girls’ overall design experience, since it influenced their choice of topic, and challenged their emergent understanding of climate change as a systems problem."

abstract,"Abstract Research-based digital games hold great potential to be effective tools in supporting next-generation science learning. However, as with all instructional materials, teachers significantly influence their implementation and contribute to their effectiveness. To more fully understand the contributions and challenges of teacher implementation of digital games, we studied the replacement of existing high school biology genetics lessons over a 3- to 6-week period with Geniverse, an immersive, game-like learning environment designed to be used in classrooms. The Geniverse materials infuse virtual experimentation in genetics with a narrative of a quest to heal a genetic disease; incorporate the topics of meiosis and protein synthesis with inheritance; and include the science practices of explanation and argumentation. The research design involved a quasi-experiment with 48 high school teachers and about 2000 students, student science content knowledge and argumentation outcome measures, and analysis using hierarchical linear modeling. Results  indicate that when Geniverse was implemented as the designers intended, student learning of genetics content was significantly greater than in the comparison, business-as-usual group. However, a wide range of levels of Geniverse implementation resulted in no significant difference between the groups as a whole. Students’ abilities to engage in scientific explanation and argumentation were greater in the Geniverse group, but these differences were not statistically significant. Observation, survey, and interview data indicate a range of barriers to implementation and teacher instructional decisions that may have influenced student outcomes. Implications for the role of the teacher in the implementation of game-based instructional materials are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Theatre is often introduced into science museums to enhance visitor experience. While learning in museums exhibitions received considerable research attention, learning from museum theatre has not. The goal of this exploratory study was to investigate the potential educational role of a science museum theatre play. The study aimed to investigate (1) cognitive learning outcomes of the play, (2) how these outcomes interact with different viewing contexts and (3) experiential learning outcomes through the theatrical experience. The play ‘Robot and I’, addressing principles in robotics, was commissioned by a science museum. Data consisted of 391 questionnaires and interviews with 47 children and 20 parents. Findings indicate that explicit but not implicit learning goals were decoded successfully. There was little synergy between learning outcomes of the play and an exhibition on robotics, demonstrating the effect of two different physical contexts. Interview data revealed that prior knowledge, experience and interest played a major role in children’s understanding of the play. Analysis of the theatrical experience showed that despite strong identification with the child protagonist, children often doubted the protagonist’s knowledge jeopardizing integration of scientific content. The study extends the empirical knowledge and theoretical thinking on museum theatre to better support claims of its virtues and respond to their criticism."

abstract,"Abstract An important, but as yet unresolved pedagogical question is whether discovery-oriented or direct instruction methods lead to greater learning and transfer. We address this issue in a study with 101 fourth and fifth grade students that contrasts two distinct instructional methods. One is a blend of discovery and direct instruction called Invent-then-Tell (IT), and the other is a version of direct instruction called Tell-then-Practice (TP). The relative effectiveness of these methods is compared in the context of learning a critical inquiry skill—the control-of-variables strategy. Previous research has demonstrated the success of IT over TP for teaching deep domain structures, while other research has demonstrated the superiority of direct instruction for teaching simple experimental design, a domain-general inquiry skill. In the present study, students in both conditions made equally large gains on an immediate assessment of their application and conceptual understanding of experimental design, and they also performed similarly on a test of far transfer. These results were fairly consistent across school populations with various levels of prior achievement and socioeconomic status. Findings suggest that broad claims about the relative effectiveness of these two distinct methods should be conditionalized by particular instructional contexts, such as the type of knowledge being taught."

abstract,"Abstract The recent emphasis in higher education on both student engagement and online learning encouraged the authors to develop an active e-learning environment for an introductory geohazards course, which enrolls 70+ undergraduate students per semester. Instructors focused on replicating the achievements and addressing the challenges within an already established face-to-face student-centered class (Brudzinski and Sikorski 2010; Sit 2013). Through the use of a learning management system (LMS) and other available technologies, a wide range of course components were developed including online homework assignments with automatic grading and tailored feedback, video tutorials of software programs like Google Earth and Microsoft Excel, and more realistic scientific investigations using authentic and freely available data downloaded from the internet. The different course components designed to engage students and improve overall student learning and development were evaluated using student surveys and instructor reflection. Each component can be used independently and intertwined into a face-to-face course. Results  suggest that significant opportunities are available in an online environment including the potential for improved student performance and new datasets for educational research. Specifically, results from pre and post-semester Geoscience Concept Inventory (GCI) testing in an active e-learning course show enhanced student learning gains compared to face-to-face lecture-based and student-centered courses."

A total of 172 undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of four instructional video game conditions or the control. Results  found that knowledge significantly increased from the pretest for players in all game conditions. Participants in summative assessment conditions learned more than players without summative assessment. In terms of engagement outcomes, formative assessment conditions did not significantly produce better learning engagement outcomes than conditions without formative assessment. However, summative assessment conditions were associated with higher temporal disassociation than non-summative conditions. Implications for future instructional video game development and testing are discussed in the paper."

abstract,"Abstract Research indicates that preservice teacher (PT) education programs can positively impact perceptions of scientific probeware use in K-8 environments. Despite the potential of probeware to improve science instruction and student engagement, its use in elementary education has been limited. Sixty-seven PT enrolled across three sections of an elementary science methods course participated in a mixed-methods study through which they utilized probeware in a thematic experience on ocean acidification. One-way repeated measures ANOVA of pre and post survey data measuring subscales of utility, ability, and intent to use probeware demonstrated a statistically significant increase with medium to large effect sizes for all subscales across all sections \( \left(p<0.01,\kern0.5em {\eta}_p^2=0.384;\kern0.5em p<0.001,\kern0.5em {\eta}_p^2=0.517;\kern0.0em p<0.001,\kern0.0em {\eta}_p^2=0.214\right) \). Analysis of reflective journals revealed over 60% felt the multiple capabilities (notably graphing) of probeware make it a useful classroom tool, and almost one-half believed that its use makes science more enjoyable and engaging. Mapping of the unitized data from the journals on the Next Generation Science Standards suggested that probeware use especially engages learners in planning and carrying out investigations and in analyzing and interpreting data. Journals also revealed that despite PT having prior experience with probeware in science courses, its use in their future elementary classroom is conditional on having a positive experience with probeware in a science methods course. Further, embedding a probeware experience in a unit on ocean acidification provides PT with strategies for addressing climate change and engaging in argument from evidence."

abstract,"Abstract Considerable work over many years has explored the contribution technology can make to science learning, at all levels of education. In the school sector, historically this has focused on the use of fixed, desktop-based or semi-mobile laptop systems for purposes such as experiment data collection or analysis, or as a means of engaging or motivating interest in science. However, the advent of mobile devices such as iPads supported by a huge array of low or no cost apps, means that new opportunities are becoming available for teachers to explore how these resources may be useful for supporting ‘hands on’ science learning. This article reports outcomes from a study of primary (elementary) school students’ use of a series of apps integrated with practical science activities, in a topic exploring Energy concepts. It used an innovative display capture tool to examine how the students used the apps and features of their iPads to scaffold their practical work at different stages during the experiments. Results  identify device functions and app-based scaffolds that assisted these students to structure their experiments, understand procedures, think about the influence of variables and communicate and share outcomes. However, they also discovered limitations in the apps’ ability to support conceptual knowledge development, identifying the critical role of teachers and the importance of task structure and design to ensuring conceptual knowledge objectives are met."

abstract,"Abstract Nanotechnology is an emerging technology, and it is regarded as the basis for the next industrial revolution. In developing countries, nanotechnology promises to solve everyday challenges, such as the provision of potable water, reliable energy sources and effective medication. However, there are several challenges in the exploitation of nanotechnology. One of the notable challenges is the lack of adequate knowledge about how materials behave at the nanoscale. As nanotechnology is relatively new, the current generation of scientists have not had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of the technology at an early stage. Young students who are at the primary school level may follow the same trajectory if they are not exposed to the technology. There is a need to lay a strong foundation by introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology to students at the primary school level. It is during the early stages of child development that students master basic concepts for life long learning. Nevertheless, many primary school children, particularly those in developing countries are missing the chance of learning about nanoscience and nanotechnology because it is regarded as being abstract and complex. In this paper, we argue that despite the complexity of nanoscience and nanotechnology, science centres can be used as one of the platforms for exposing young students to the discipline. We use a case study of a museum-based science centre as an example to illustrate that young students can be exposed to nanoscience and nanotechnology using tactile and hands-on experience. The early engagement of primary school children with nanoscience and nanotechnology is important in raising the next generation of scientists who are firmly grounded in the discipline."

abstract,"Abstract We describe the development of the Measure of Affect in Science and Technology (MAST), and study its usefulness for measuring science affect in middle school students via both classical and Rasch measurement perspectives. We then proceed to utilize the measurement structure of the MAST to understand how middle school students at varying levels of affect express their interest and attitudes toward science and technology and gender differences in how students express their affect. We found that affect in science and technology comprises a main dimension, science interest, and four peripheral dimensions: interest in careers in science and technology, attitudes toward science, and interest in attending science class. Of these, careers in science and technology carry the highest affective demand. While males showed higher levels of personal and situational interest in science, a greater interest in careers in science and technology was the biggest contributor to males’ higher affect toward science and technology. We argue that whether the MAST is used as a measure of a single construct or multiple subconstructs depends upon specific research or evaluation goals; however, both uses of the MAST yield measures which produce valid inferences for student affect."

abstract,"Abstract University courses concerning Computer Vision and Image Processing are generally taught using a traditional methodology that is focused on the teacher rather than on the students. This approach is consequently not effective when teachers seek to attain cognitive objectives involving their students’ critical thinking.This manuscript covers the development, implementation and assessment of a short project-based engineering course with MATLAB applications Multimedia Engineering being taken by Bachelor’s degree students. The principal goal of all course lectures and hands-on laboratory activities was for the students to not only acquire image-specific technical skills but also a general knowledge of data analysis so as to locate phenomena in pixel regions of images and video frames. This would hopefully enable the students to develop skills regarding the implementation of the filters, operators, methods and techniques used for image processing and computer vision software libraries. Our teaching-learning process thus permits the accomplishment of knowledge assimilation, student motivation and skill development through the use of a continuous evaluation strategy to solve practical and real problems by means of short projects designed using MATLAB applications. Project-based learning is not new. This approach has been used in STEM learning in recent decades. But there are many types of projects. The aim of the current study is to analyse the efficacy of short projects as a learning tool when compared to long projects during which the students work with more independence. This work additionally presents the impact of different types of activities, and not only short projects, on students’ overall results in this subject. Moreover, a statistical study has allowed the author to suggest a link between the students’ success ratio and the type of content covered and activities completed on the course. The results described in this paper show that those students who took part in short projects made a significant improvement when compared to those who participated in long projects."

abstract,"Abstract The societal demand for inspiring and engaging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and preparing our workforce for the emerging creative economy has necessitated developing students’ self-efficacy and understanding of engineering design processes from as early as elementary school levels. Hands-on engineering design activities have shown the potential to promote middle school students’ self-efficacy and understanding of engineering design processes. However, traditional classrooms often lack hands-on engineering design experiences, leaving students unprepared to solve real-world design problems. In this study, we introduce the framework of a toy design workshop and investigate the influence of the workshop activities on students’ understanding of and self-efficacy beliefs in engineering design. Using a mixed method approach, we conducted quantitative analyses to show changes in students’ engineering design self-efficacy and qualitative analyses to identify students’ understanding of the engineering design processes. Findings show that among the 24 participants, there is a significant increase in students’ self-efficacy beliefs after attending the workshop. We also identified major themes such as design goals and prototyping in students’ understanding of engineering design processes. This research provides insights into the key elements of middle school students’ engineering design learning and the benefits of engaging middle school students in hands-on toy design workshops."

abstract,"Abstract The new guidelines for science education emphasize the need to introduce computers and digital technologies as a means of enabling visualization and data collection and analysis. This requires science teachers to bring advanced technologies into the classroom and use them wisely. Hence, the goal of this study was twofold: to examine the application of web-based technologies in science teacher preparation courses and to examine pre-service teachers’ perceptions of “cloud pedagogy”—an instructional framework that applies technologies for the promotion of social constructivist learning. The study included university teachers (N = 48) and pre-service science teachers (N = 73). Data were collected from an online survey, written reflections, and interviews. The findings indicated that university teachers use technologies mainly for information management and the distribution of learning materials and less for applying social constructivist pedagogy. University teachers expect their students (i.e., pre-service science teachers) to use digital tools in their future classroom to a greater extent than they themselves do. The findings also indicated that the “cloud pedagogy” was perceived as an appropriate instructional framework for contemporary science education. The application of the cloud pedagogy fosters four attributes: the ability to adapt to frequent changes and uncertain situations, the ability to collaborate and communicate in decentralized environments, the ability to generate data and manage it, and the ability to explore new venous."

abstract,"Abstract Nanobiotechnology, which resulted from the convergence of biotechnology and nanotechnology, is a new field of research, and it has an increasing impact on peoples’ everyday lives. Thus, it is important to measure peoples’ attitudes towards nanobiotechnology, in particular, those who are specifically involved in biology and science education. However, despite the existence of an adequate number of instruments on biotechnology or nanotechnology, for nanobiotechnology, there is no instrument that has been rigorously validated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a nanobiotechnology scale for assessing the undergraduate students’ attitudes. The data were gathered from 236 student teachers enrolled in the departments of biology education and elementary science education. The findings from exploratory factor analysis (EFA) provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the final form of the scale. At total of 36 items were identified and contained within the following four factors, nanobiotechnology awareness, interest in nanobiotechnology, nanobiotechnology education, and the applications of nanobiotechnology. The total variance was 53.021%, and the Cronbach’s alpha for the overall scale was 0.93. The scale was later given to 203 student teachers, the results of which were presented in this study. The results indicated significant differences in gender and department in some of the subscales of the scale. As a result, it is believed that the instrument will be a valuable tool for both instructors and researchers in science education to assess the student teachers’ attitudes about nanobiotechnology."

We implemented an electronic textiles unit with 23 high school students ages 16–17 years who learned how to craft and code circuits with the LilyPad Arduino, an electronic textile construction kit. Our analyses not only confirm significant increases in students’ understanding of functional circuits but also showcase students’ ability in designing and remixing program code for controlling circuits. In our discussion, we address opportunities and challenges of introducing codeable circuit design for integrating maker activities that include engineering and computing into classrooms."

abstract,"Abstract Over the past decade, there has been a strong national push to increase minority students’ positive attitudes towards STEM-related careers. However, despite this focus, minority students have remained underrepresented in these fields. Some researchers have directed their attention towards improving the STEM pipeline which carries students through our educational system and into STEM careers. Previous research has shown that expectancy-value theory (EVT) is useful for examining the short-term as well as long-term academic motivations and intentions of elementary age minority students. These findings provide insights into ways we may be able to potentially “patch” particular STEM pipeline leaks. In the current study, we advance this research by using EVT as a framework to examine the STEM attitudes of young students directly. We hypothesize that students’ academic-related expectancies for success and subjective task values will be associated with an increase in STEM attitudes. Data for this study was gathered over the course of a large-scale computing intervention which sought to increase students’ STEM interest. This computing intervention took place in an urban elementary school district located within the southeastern USA. Results  from this study indicate that both intrinsic values and utility values predict students’ STEM attitudes but they influence attitudes related to the various dimensions of STEM differently. These findings demonstrate that EVT provides a useful framework, which can be integrated into future computing interventions, to help encourage positive STEM attitudes in young children, thus increasing the internal pressure (or flow) within the STEM pipeline."

abstract,"Abstract Most interventions with “maker” technologies take place outside of school or out of core area classrooms. However, intervening in schools holds potential for reaching much larger numbers of students and the opportunity to shift instructional dynamics in classrooms. This paper shares one such intervention where electronic textiles (sewable circuits) were introduced into eighth grade science classes with the intent of exploring possible gains in student learning and motivation, particularly for underrepresented minorities. Using a quasi-experimental design, four classes engaged in a traditional circuitry unit while the other four classes undertook a new e-textile unit. Overall, students in both groups demonstrated significant learning gains on standard test items without significant differences between conditions. Significant differences appeared between groups’ attitudes toward science after the units in ways that show increasing interest in science by students in the e-textile unit. In particular, they reported positive identity shifts pertaining to their perceptions of the beliefs of their friends, family, and teacher. Findings and prior research suggest that student-created e-textile designs provide opportunities for connections outside of the classroom with friends and family and may shift students’ perceptions of their teacher’s beliefs about them more positively."

abstract,"Abstract This study measures the success of using a collaborative and competitive video game, named Space Race, to teach computing to first year engineering students. Space Race is played by teams of four, each with their own tablet, collaborating to compete against the other teams in the class. The impact of the game on student learning was studied through measurements using 485 students, over one term. Surveys were used to gauge student reception of the game. Pre and post-tests, and in-course examinations were used to quantify student performance. The game was well received with at least 82% of the students that played it recommending it to others. In some cases, game participants outperformed non-participants on course exams. On the final course exam, all of the statistically significant (p<0.05) comparisons (42% of the relevant questions) showed a performance improvement of game participants on the questions, with a maximum grade improvement of 41%. The findings also suggest that some students retain the knowledge obtained from Space Race for at least 7 weeks. The results of this study provide strong evidence that a collaborative and competitive video game can be an effective tool for teaching computing in post-secondary education."

We compared two supplementary web-based modules using active learning strategies: the first used Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction as a framework for organizing multiple active learning strategies; the second used a traditional web-based approach. Results  indicated that (a) the First Principles group gained significantly from pretest to posttest at the Remember level (t(40) = −1.432, p = 0.08, ES = 0.4) and at the Problem Solving level (U = 142.5, N1 = 21, N2 = 21, p = .02, ES = 0.7) and (b) the Traditional group gained significantly from pretest to posttest at the Remember level (t(36) = 1.762, p = 0.043, ES = 0.6). Those in the First Principles group were significantly more likely than the traditional group to be confident in their ability to solve problems in the future (χ2 (2, N = 40) = 3.585, p = 0.09)."

abstract,"Abstract As students increasingly use online chemistry animations and simulations, it is becoming more important to understand how students independently engage with such materials and to develop a set of best practices for students’ use of these resources outside of the classroom. Most of the literature examining students’ use of animations and simulations has focused on classroom use with some studies suggesting that better outcomes are obtained when students use simulations with minimal guidance while others indicate the need for appropriate scaffolding. This study examined differences with respect to (1) student understanding of the concept of dissolution of ionic and covalent compounds in water and (2) student use of electronic resources when students were asked to complete an assignment either by manipulating a simulation on their own or by watching a screencast in which an expert manipulated the same simulation. Comparison of students’ pre- and posttest scores, answers to assignment questions, near-transfer follow-up questions, and eye-tracking analysis suggested that students who viewed the screencast gained a better understanding of the dissolving process, including interactions with water at the particulate level, particularly for covalent compounds. Additionally, the eye tracking indicated that there were significant differences in the ways that the different treatment groups (screencast or simulation) used the electronic resources."

abstract,"Abstract Increasing adoption and adaptation of promising instructional strategies and materials has been identified as a critical component needed to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This paper examines typical propagation practices and resulting outcomes of proposals written by developers of educational innovations. These proposals were analyzed using the Designing for Sustained Adoption Assessment Instrument (DSAAI), an instrument developed to evaluate propagation plans, and the results used to predict the likelihood that a successful project would result in adoption by others. We found that few education developers propose strong propagation plans. Afterwards, a follow-up analysis was conducted to see which propagation strategies developers actually used to help develop, disseminate, and support their innovations. A web search and interviews with principal investigators were used to determine the degree to which propagation plans were actually implemented and to estimate adoption of the innovations. In this study, we analyzed 71 education development proposals funded by the National Science Foundation and predicted that 80% would be unsuccessful in propagating their innovations. Follow-up data collection with a subset of these suggests that the predictions were reasonably accurate."

The present study also investigated interrelations among preservice teachers’ attitudes towards technology use, technology ownership, technology competencies, and experiences. The participants of study were 665 elementary preservice science teachers (467 females, 198 males) from 7 colleges in Turkey. The proposed model based on educational technology literature was tested using structural equation modeling. The model testing results revealed that preservice teachers’ technology competencies and experiences mediated the relation of technology ownership to their TPACK self efficacy beliefs. The direct relation of their possession of technology to their TPACK self efficacy beliefs was insignificant while the indirect relation through their technology competencies and experiences was significant. The results also indicated there were significant direct effects of preservice teachers’ attitudes towards technology use, technology competencies, and experiences on their TPACK self efficacy beliefs."

abstract,"Abstract Electromagnetism is an umbrella encapsulating several different concepts like electric current, electric fields and forces, and magnetic fields and forces, among other topics. However, a number of studies in the past have highlighted the poor conceptual understanding of electromagnetism concepts by students even after instruction. This study aims to identify novel forms of “hands-on” instruction that can result in representational competence and conceptual gain. Specifically, this study aimed to identify if the use of visuohaptic simulations can have an effect on student representations of electromagnetic-related concepts. The guiding questions is How do visuohaptic simulations influence undergraduate students’ representations of electric forces? Participants included nine undergraduate students from science, technology, or engineering backgrounds who participated in a think-aloud procedure while interacting with a visuohaptic simulation. The think-aloud procedure was divided in three stages, a prediction stage, a minimally visual haptic stage, and a visually enhanced haptic stage. The results of this study suggest that students’ accurately characterized and represented the forces felt around a particle, line, and ring charges either in the prediction stage, a minimally visual haptic stage or the visually enhanced haptic stage. Also, some students accurately depicted the three-dimensional nature of the field for each configuration in the two stages that included a tactile mode, where the point charge was the most challenging one."

abstract,"Abstract In this study, we designed and developed an app called Ubiquitous-Physics (U-Physics) for mobile devices like tablet PC or smart phones to help students learn the principles behind a simple pendulum in Physics. The unique characteristic of U-Physics is the use of sensors on mobile devices to collect acceleration and velocity data during pendulum swings. The data collected are transformed to facilitate students’ understanding of the pendulum time period. U-Physics helped students understand the effects of pendulum mass, length, and angle in relation to its time period. In addition, U-Physics was equipped with an annotation function such as textual annotation to help students interpret and understand the concepts and phenomena of the simple pendulum. U-Physics also generated graphs automatically to demonstrate the time period during which the pendulum was swinging. Results  showed a significant positive correlation between interpreting graphs and applying formula. This finding indicated that the ability to interpret graphs has an important role in scientific learning. Therefore, we strongly recommend that physics teachers use graphs to enrich students’ information content and understanding and negative correlation between pair coherence and interpreting graphs. It may be that most of the participants (vocational high school students) have limited skill or confidence in physics problem solving; so, they often seek help from teachers or their high-achieving peers. In addition, the findings also indicated that U-Physics can enhance students’ achievement during a 3-week time period. We hope that this app can be globally used to learn physics in the future."

abstract,"Abstract This study examines an out-of-school time program targeting elementary-aged youth from populations that are typically underrepresented in science fields (primarily African-American, Hispanic, and/or English Language Learner participants). The program aimed to foster positive attitudes toward science among youth by engaging them in growing plants hydroponically (in water without soil). Participants’ attitudes toward science, including anxiety, desire, and self-concept, were examined through pre-post survey data (n = 234) over the course of an afterschool program at three separate sites. Data showed that participants’ anxiety decreased and desire increased for both male and female participants over the program. Self-concept increased for female participants at all three sites but did not change significantly for male participants. Participants’ first language (English or Spanish) was not a factor in attitude outcomes. The primarily positive outcomes suggest that hydroponics can be a useful educational platform for engaging participants in garden-based programming year round, particularly for settings that do not have the physical space or climate to conduct outdoor gardening. Similarities in positive attitude outcomes at the three sites despite differences in format, implementation, and instructor background experience suggest that the program is resilient to variation in context. Understanding which aspects of the program facilitated positive outcomes in the varied contexts could be useful for the design of future programs."

abstract,"Abstract This research explores learning in science museums through the most common activity in a science museum—interaction with exhibits. The goal of this study was to characterize the learning behaviors exhibited by students as they engage with interactive exhibits in order to draw insight regarding the design of the exhibits. In order to do so, we used a qualitative method of observation as well as the Visitor Engagement Framework (VEF) model, a visitor-based framework for assessing visitors’ learning experiences with exhibits in a science center setting. The combined method produced a framework of nine learning behaviors exhibited during the visitors’ interaction with the exhibits, grouped into three categories that reflect increasing levels of engagement and depth of the learning experience. Our research participants consisted of a total 1800 students aged 10–12 (4th, 5th, and 6th graders) who came to the museum with their class for a day visit. We observed nine exhibits, each visited by 200 students. Our observations revealed several design elements that contribute to engagement with exhibits in science museums. For example, exhibits that have familiar activation encourage visitors’ interaction, exhibits that facilitate social interaction are more likely to increase engagement, and the highest levels of engagement can be found in exhibits that support large groups."

abstract,"Abstract In flipped classrooms, lectures, which are normally delivered in-class, are assigned as homework in the form of videos, and assignments that were traditionally assigned as homework, are done as learning activities in class. It was hypothesized that the effectiveness of the flipped model hinges on a student’s desire and ability to adopt a self-directed learning style. The purpose of this study was twofold; it aimed at examining the relationship between two variables—students’ perceptions of the flipped model and their self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors—and the impact that these variables have on achievement in a flipped class. For the study, 76 participants from a flipped introductory biology course were asked about their SRL strategy use and perceptions of the flipped model. SRL strategy use was measured using a modified version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Wolters et al. 2005), while the flipped perceptions survey was newly derived. Student letter grades were collected as a measure of achievement. Through regression analysis, it was found that students’ perceptions of the flipped model positively predict students’ use of several types of SRL strategies. However, the data did not indicate a relationship between student perceptions and achievement, neither directly nor indirectly, through SRL strategy use. Results  suggest that flipped classrooms demonstrate their successes in the active learning sessions through constructivist teaching methods. Video lectures hold an important role in flipped classes, however, students may need to practice SRL skills to become more self-directed and effectively learn from them."

abstract,"Abstract This project developed and studied The Source, an alternate reality game (ARG) designed to foster interest and knowledge related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) among youth from populations underrepresented in STEM fields. ARGs are multiplayer games that engage participants across several media such as shared websites, social media, personal communications, and real-world settings to complete activities and collaborate with team members. The Source was a five-week summer program with 144 participants from Chicago aged 13 to 18 years. The Source incorporated six socio-contextual factors derived from three frameworks: Chang’s (ERIC Digest, 2002) recommendations for engaging underrepresented populations in STEM careers, Lave and Wenger’s (Cambridge University Press, 1991) situated learning model, and Barron’s (Human Development, 49(4); 193-224, 2006) learning ecology perspective. These factors aligned with the program’s aims of promoting (1) social community and peer support, (2) collaboration and teamwork, (3) real-world relevance and investigative learning, (4) mentoring and exposure to STEM professionals, (5) hands-on activities to foster transferable skill building, and (6) interface with technology. This paper presents results from 10 focus groups and 10 individual interviews conducted with a subset of the 144 youth participants who completed the game. It describes how these six factors were realized through The Source and uses them as a lens for considering how The Source functioned pedagogically. Qualitative findings describe youth’s perception of The Source’s potential influence on STEM interest, engagement, and identity formation. Despite limitations, study results indicate that underrepresented youth can engage in an immersive, narrative, and game-based experience as a potential mechanism for piquing and developing STEM interest and skills, particularly among underrepresented youth."

abstract,"Abstract Despite the increasing use of portable tablets in learning, their impact has received little attention in research. In five different projects, this media-ethnographic and design-based analysis of the use of portable tablets as a learning resource in science museums investigates how young people’s learning with portable tablets matches the intentions of the museums. By applying media and information literacy (MIL) components as analytical dimensions, a pattern of discrepancies between young people’s expectations, their actual learning and the museums’ approaches to framing such learning is identified. It is argued that, paradoxically, museums’ decisions to innovate by introducing new technologies, such as portable tablets, and new pedagogies to support them conflict with many young people’s traditional ideas of museums and learning. The assessment of the implications of museums’ integration of portable tablets indicates that in making pedagogical transformations to accommodate new technologies, museums risk opposing didactic intention if pedagogies do not sufficiently attend to young learners’ systemic expectations to learning and to their expectations to the digital experience influenced by their leisure use."

The results show that the learners who viewed the video without the human hand present performed significantly better on a learning test and experienced a significantly better training efficiency than the learners who viewed the video with the human hand present. Meanwhile, those who learned with the human hand present in the instructional video rated the instructor as being more humanlike and engaging. The results have implications for both theory and practice. Implications for those designing instructional videos are discussed, as well as the limitations of the current study."

In this paper, we present Physlet-based materials for supporting conceptual learning about electricity. To conduct research into the effectiveness of these materials, we designed two different physics courses: one group of students, the experimental group, was taught using Physlet-based materials and the second group of students, the control group, was taught using expository instruction without using Physlets. After completion of the teaching, we assessed students’ thinking skills and analysed the materials with an independent t test, multiple regression analyses and one-way analysis of covariance. The test scores were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of conceptual learning about electricity with the help of Physlet-based materials."

To answer this question, we carried out a case study research aimed at testing graphic production skills in anatomy of nutrition. The graphics produced by 118 children in the final year of primary education were analysed. The children had to draw a diagram of a human cross section, integrating knowledge of anatomy acquired from longitudinal sections. The results show that they have very limited skills in producing these graphics judging by the dimensions (scale, shape, organs represented and its organization inside the section) and their conception of human anatomy at thoracic level (location of the organs, elements in the spaces between them and connections between organs). The results also indicate that the only exposure to cross-sections in daily life is not enough by itself to draw them correctly, so this type of graphic production should be addressed from the earliest stages of education, since it contributes to the development of visual literacy, and this is a crucial skill when it comes to learning science concepts and developing scientific literacy."

The TLS focused on the relation of air pollution with wind and topography in local conditions. An authentic context was provided to the students based on daily up-to-date meteorological data via the Internet in order to estimate air pollution. The results are encouraging given that PET can correlate wind and concentration of air pollutants through reading specialized angular diagrams and weather maps, can recognize the correlation of topography in the concentration of air pollutants, and can describe temperature inversion. However, the PET demonstrated clear difficulties in ability of orientation, in wind naming, and in interpretation of symbols on weather map. Finally, the implications on teaching air pollution are discussed."

However, correlations between homework and examination scores tend to be low, likely due to unproductive student behavior such as copying and random guessing of answers. In this study, we attempt to model these two counterproductive learner behaviors within the framework of Item Response Theory in order to provide an ability measurement that strongly correlates with examination scores. We find that introducing additional item parameters leads to worse predictions of examination grades, while introducing additional learner traits is a more promising approach."

history,"['2017-04', '2016-12-01']"
abstract,"Abstract Current research indicates that inquiry-based learning should be guided in order to achieve optimal learning outcomes. The need for guidance is even greater when simulations are used because of their high information content and the difficulty of extracting information from them. Previous research on guidance for learning with simulations has concentrated on guidance provided by the simulation. Little research has been done on the role of the teacher in guiding learners with inquiry-based activities using simulations. This descriptive study focuses on guidance provided during small group investigations; pre-service teachers (n = 8) guided third and fifth graders using a particular simulation. Data was collected using screen capture videos. The data was analyzed using a combination of theory- and data-driven analysis. Forms of guidance provided by the simulation and by the teachers were divided into the same categories. The distribution of the guidance between the teacher and the simulation was also analyzed. The categories for forms of guidance provided by simulations proved to be applicable to guidance provided by the teachers as well. Teachers offered more various forms of guidance than the simulation. The teachers adapted their guidance and used different patterns to complement the guidance provided by the simulation. The results of the study show that guidance provided by teachers and simulations have different affordances, and both should be present in the classroom for optimal support of learning. This has implications for both teaching with simulations and development of new simulations."

abstract,"Abstract The current impetus for increasing STEM in K-12 education calls for an examination of how preservice teachers are being prepared to teach STEM. This paper reports on a study that examined elementary preservice teachers’ (n = 21) self-efficacy, understanding of science concepts, and computational thinking as they engaged with robotics in a science methods course. Data collection methods included pretests and posttests on science content, prequestionnaires and postquestionnaires for interest and self-efficacy, and four programming assignments. Statistical results showed that preservice teachers’ interest and self-efficacy with robotics increased. There was a statistically significant difference between preknowledge and postknowledge scores, and preservice teachers did show gains in learning how to write algorithms and debug programs over repeated programming tasks. The findings suggest that the robotics activity was an effective instructional strategy to enhance interest in robotics, increase self-efficacy to teach with robotics, develop understandings of science concepts, and promote the development of computational thinking skills. Study findings contribute quantitative evidence to the STEM literature on how robotics develops preservice teachers’ self-efficacy, science knowledge, and computational thinking skills in higher education science classroom contexts."

history,"['2017-04', '2016-12-12']"
abstract,"Abstract The term failure typically evokes negative connotations in educational settings and is likely to be accompanied by negative emotional states, low sense of confidence, and lack of persistence. These negative emotional and behavioral states may factor into an individual not pursuing a degree or career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). This is of particular concern considering the low number of women and underrepresented minorities pursing and working in a STEM field. Utilizing interview data with professionals across STEM, we sought to understand the role failure played in the persistence of individuals who enter and pursue paths toward STEM-related careers. Findings highlighted how participants’ experiences with failure (1) shaped their outlooks or views of failure, (2) shaped their trajectories within STEM, and (3) provided them with additional skills or qualities. A few differences based on participants’ sex, field, and highest degree also manifested in our analysis. We expect the results from this study to add research-based results to the current conversation around whether experiences with failure should be part of formal and informal educational settings and standards-based practices."

history,"['2017-04', '2016-11-29']"
abstract,"Abstract The new science education reform documents call for integration of engineering into K-12 science classes. Engineering design and practices are new to most science teachers, meaning that implementing effective engineering instruction is likely to be challenging. This quasi-experimental study explored the influence of teacher-developed, engineering design-based science curriculum units on learning and achievement among grade 4–8 students of different races, gender, special education status, and limited English proficiency (LEP) status. Treatment and control students (n = 4450) completed pretest and posttest assessments in science, engineering, and mathematics as well as a state-mandated mathematics test. Single-level regression results for science outcomes favored the treatment for one science assessment (physical science, heat transfer), but multilevel analyses showed no significant treatment effect. We also found that engineering integration had different effects across race and gender and that teacher gender can reduce or exacerbate the gap in engineering achievement for student subgroups depending on the outcome. Other teacher factors such as the quality of engineering-focused science units and engineering instruction were predictive of student achievement in engineering. Implications for practice are discussed."

history,"['2017-02', '2016-09-14']"
abstract,"Abstract The well-being of modern economies and societies is increasingly requiring citizens to possess capabilities in integrating knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering and science to solve problems. However, by the end of schooling, the majority of Australian students show little interest in these discipline areas and have no plans to continue study or work in them; many refer to these disciplines as boring. Further, they typically have little experience in integrating knowledge and skills from these disciplines and/or in applying this to solve relevant problems. Therefore, there is a need to engage students with such learning experiences to develop their interest and capabilities, particularly during the early years of secondary schooling. This is not easy for teachers to respond to, but with the support of modern digital technologies and the new Australian curriculum, the potential is expanded and the challenge is more readily achievable. However, appropriate pedagogies need to be supported that include more authentic approaches to assessment. Learning activities need to support students to integrate knowledge and skills across discipline areas in tackling real problems, and this also needs to be reflected in how students are assessed. In this paper, I will draw on personal experience as a teacher, a review of recent literature, components of the Australian Curriculum, and findings from research projects associated with my University research centre, to argue for, and illustrate how, teachers can orchestrate powerful learning activities to promote an interdisciplinary approach to STEM."

history,"['2017-02', '2016-10-08']"
abstract,"Abstract Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a well-recognized model of academic assistance with a history of empirical evidence demonstrating increases in student grades and decreases in failure rates across many higher education institutions. However, as college students become more accustomed to learning in online venues, what is not known is whether an SI program offered online could benefit students similarly to SI sessions that occur in face-to-face settings. The in-person (traditional) SI program at California State University San Marcos has demonstrated increases in grades and lower fail rates for courses being supported in science and math. Students enrolled in four biology courses who participated in online SI received increases in academic performance similar to the students in the courses who attended traditional SI. Both the online and traditional SI participating students had higher course grades and lower fail rates as compared to students who did not participate in either form of SI. Self-selection, as measured by past cumulative college grade point average, did not differ between students who attended either form of SI or who did not attend. Student perceptions of online SI were generally positive and appeared to offer an alternative path to receive this valuable academic assistance for some students. Overall, results are promising that the highly effective traditional model can be translated to an online environment."

abstract,"Abstract Videos of classroom lectures have proven to be a popular and versatile learning resource. A key shortcoming of the lecture video format is accessing the content of interest hidden in a video. This work meets this challenge with an advanced video framework featuring topical indexing, search, and captioning (ICS videos). Standard optical character recognition (OCR) technology was enhanced with image transformations for extraction of text from video frames to support indexing and search. The images and text on video frames is analyzed to divide lecture videos into topical segments. The ICS video player integrates indexing, search, and captioning in video playback providing instant access to the content of interest. This video framework has been used by more than 70 courses in a variety of STEM disciplines and assessed by more than 4000 students. Results  presented from the surveys demonstrate the value of the videos as a learning resource and the role played by videos in a students learning process. Survey results also establish the value of indexing and search features in a video platform for education. This paper reports on the development and evaluation of ICS videos framework and over 5 years of usage experience in several STEM courses."

history,"['2017-02', '2016-08-22']"
abstract,"Abstract Ecosystem modeling is a critically important tool for environmental scientists, yet is rarely taught in undergraduate and graduate classrooms. To address this gap, we developed a teaching module that exposes students to a suite of modeling skills and tools (including computer programming, numerical simulation modeling, and distributed computing) that students apply to study how lakes around the globe are experiencing the effects of climate change. In the module, students develop hypotheses about the effects of different climate scenarios on lakes and then test their hypotheses using hundreds of model simulations. We taught the module in a 4-hour workshop and found that participation in the module significantly increased both undergraduate and graduate students’ understanding about climate change effects on lakes. Moreover, participation in the module also significantly increased students’ perceived experience level in using different software, technologies, and modeling tools. By embedding modeling in an environmental science context, non-computer science students were able to successfully use and master technologies that they had previously never been exposed to. Overall, our findings suggest that modeling is a powerful tool for catalyzing student learning on the effects of climate change."

keyword,"['Cyberlearning\xa0', 'Design\xa0', 'Learning environments\xa0']"
history,"['2017-02', '2016-08-30']"
abstract,"Abstract Scientific inscriptions—graphs, diagrams, and data—and argumentation are integral to learning and communicating science and are common elements in cyberlearning environments—those involving the use of networked learning technologies. However, previous research has indicated that learners struggle to use inscriptions and when they engage in argumentation, the learning of science content becomes secondary to the learning of argumentation skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two scaffolding strategies for these elements in a secondary school context: (1) self-explanation prompts paired with a scientific inscription and (2) faded worked examples for the evaluation and development of scientific arguments. Participants consisted of ninth and tenth grade students (age 13–16 years; N = 245) enrolled in state-mandated biology courses taught by four different teachers. A three-factor mixed model analysis of variance with two between factors (self-explanation prompts and faded worked examples) and one within factor (pre-, post-, delayed posttest) was used to evaluate the effects on the acquisition and retention of domain-specific content knowledge. Results  indicated that neither strategy influenced the acquisition and retention of science content in a positive (i.e., learning) or negative (i.e., expertise reversal effect) way. Thus, general prompts were as effective as either of the scaffolding conditions. These unanticipated results suggest that additional research is warranted for learning scaffolds with pre-college populations where the gains were established with college-aged participants."

abstract,"Abstract There are many factors that shape students’ attitudes toward science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This exploratory study of high school students examined the effect of enriching chemistry with math on chemistry students’ attitudes toward math and careers involving math. To measure student attitudes, a survey was administered before and after the 18-week chemistry class; results from the chemistry class were compared to survey results from students in an elective science class that did not emphasize mathematics. At the end of the 18-week period, only the chemistry students exhibited more positive views toward their abilities in mathematics and careers that involve mathematics, as compared to their views at the outset of the course. To ensure that chemistry mastery was not hindered by the additional emphasis on math, and that mastery on state end-of-course examinations reflected knowledge acquired during the math-intensive chemistry class, a chemistry progress test was administered at the start and end of the term. This exploratory study suggests that emphasizing mathematical approaches in chemistry may positively influence attitudes toward math in general, as well as foster mastery of chemistry content."

abstract,"Abstract Despite decades of efforts to increase the participation of women and people from underrepresented minority groups (URM) in science and math majors and careers, and despite the increasing diversification of the US population as a whole (Planty et al in National Center for Education Statistics, Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, DC, 2008), participation in STEM majors and STEM careers (including STEM teaching) remains stubbornly male and white (Landivar in American Community Survey Reports, ACS-24, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 2013; National Science Foundation and National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics in Special Report NSF 15-311, Arlington, VA, 2015). This paper describes a project with two central goals: (1) to provide opportunities for URM high school students to engage in authentic science and math inquiry with the support of skilled college undergraduate mentors in the hope that these experiences will encourage these high school students to choose and persist in pursuing careers in STEM fields and, even if they do not choose those careers, to feel confident making complex, science or math-based decisions in their everyday lives and (2) to help the mentors (young people, mostly STEM majors) see teaching as a vital, intellectually challenging career that can provide them the opportunity to work for social justice in their communities. While it is unlikely that any one experience will help young people overcome the long odds that face them as they consider either path, our analysis suggests that projects of this kind can make a meaningful contribution to the effort."

abstract,"Abstract Standardized, well-established paper-and-pencil tests, which measure spatial abilities or which measure reasoning abilities, have long been found to be predictive of success in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Instructors can use these tests for prediction of success and to inform instruction. A comparative administration of spatial visualization and cognitive reasoning tests, between in-class (proctored paper and pencil) and on-line (unproctored Internet) (N = 457), was used to investigate and to determine whether the differing instrument formats yielded equal measures of spatial ability and reasoning ability in large first-semester general chemistry sections. Although some gender differences were found, findings suggest that some differences across administration formats, but that on-line administration had similar properties of predicting chemistry performance as the in-class version. Therefore, on-line administration is a viable option for instructors to consider especially when dealing with large classes."

abstract,"Abstract The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of interacting with animations using mobile devices on grade 12 students’ spatial and reasoning abilities. The study took place in a grade 12 context in Oman. A quasi-experimental design was used with an experimental group of 32 students and a control group of 28 students. The experimental group studied chemistry using mobile tablets that had a digital instructional package with different animation and simulations. There was one tablet per student. A spatial ability test and a scientific reasoning test were administered to both groups prior and after the study, which lasted for 9 weeks. The findings showed that there were significant statistical differences between the two groups in terms of spatial ability in favour of the experimental group. However, there were no differences between the two groups in terms of reasoning ability. The authors reasoned that the types of animations and simulations used in the current study featured a wide range of three-dimensional animated illustrations at the particulate level of matter. Most probably, this decreased the level of abstractness that usually accompanies chemical entities and phenomena and helped the students to visualize the interactions between submicroscopic entities spatially. Further research is needed to decide on types of scientific animations that could help students improve their scientific reasoning."

history,"['2017-02', '2016-10-13']"
abstract,"Abstract This study establishes the effects of a flipped classroom model of instruction on academic performance and attitudes of 66 first-year secondary school students towards chemistry. A pre-test and post-test experimental design was employed to assign students randomly into either the experimental or control group. In order to assess the suitability of using flipped model of instruction, students were divided in two groups. For the first group called the experimental group, a “flipped classroom” was used in which the students were given video lessons and reading materials,
 before the class to be revised at home. On the other hand, the second group followed traditional methodology, and it was used as control. The rate of reaction knowledge test and the chemistry attitude scale were administered. In addition, the researcher documented classroom observations, experiences, thoughts and insights regarding the intervention in a journal on a daily basis in order to enrich the data. Students were interviewed at the end of the research in order to enrich the qualitative data also. Findings from this study reveal that the flipped instruction model facilitates a shift in students’ conceptual understanding of the rate of chemical reaction significantly more than the control condition. Positive significant differences were found on all assessments with the flipped class students performing higher on average. Students in the flipped classroom model condition benefited by preparing for the lesson before the classes and had the opportunity to interact with peers and the teacher during the learning processes in the classroom. The findings support the notion that teachers should be trained or retrained on how to incorporate the flipped classroom model into their teaching and learning processes because it encourages students to be directly involved and active in the learning."

abstract,"Abstract The middle school years are a crucial time for cultivating students’ interest in and preparedness for future STEM careers. However, not all middle school children are provided opportunities to engage, learn and achieve in STEM subject areas. Engineering, in particular, is neglected in these grades because it usually is not part of science or mathematics curricula. This study investigates the effectiveness of an engineering-integrated STEM curriculum designed for use in an after-school environment. The inquiry-based activities comprising the unit, Think Like an Astronaut, were intended to introduce students to STEM careers—specifically engineering and aerospace engineering—and enhance their skills and knowledge applicable related to typical middle school science objectives. Results  of a field test with a diverse population of 5th grade students in nine schools revealed that Think Like an Astronaut lessons are appropriate for an after-school environment, and may potentially help increase students’ STEM-related content knowledge and skills."

abstract,"Abstract Numerous studies have indicated a need for a diverse workforce that is more highly educated in STEM and ICT fields, and one that is capable of responding creatively to demands for continual innovation. This paper, in response, chronicles the implementation of the Digital Pathways (DP) program, a two-time ITEST recipient and an ongoing initiative of the Bay Area Video Coalition. DP has provided low-income, underrepresented minority young people with 180 contact hours of activities in digital media production to prepare them to pursue higher education and technology careers. A design-based research approach synthesizes staff interviews with student observations, interviews and artifacts to identify a set of generalizable best practices or design principles for empowering young people to move from being consumers of digital media to producers. These principles are illustrated with a case study of the 3D Animation and Gaming track from the second ITEST grant. Researchers argue for the importance of attending to the noncognitive elements of learning and illustrate ways in which instructors encouraged creative expression, personal agency, and collaboration through long-term projects. They also identify strategies for sustaining young people’s participation through the establishment of a supportive community environment."

abstract,"Abstract Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a domain of knowledge, skills, and practices that is pervasive and of critical importance in our highly technological, rapidly advancing, and increasingly connected world; however, non-dominant youth, namely from non-White, lower-income, non-English-speaking, and immigrant backgrounds, are disproportionately underrepresented in STEM careers in the USA. Professional STEM career participation can be especially valuable for non-dominant populations as these careers are high quality, in-demand, and can afford one social mobility and economic stability. It is, therefore, important that we understand the ways in which non-dominant youth explore STEM careers such that we can further support and expand these. As such, this exploratory study has applied a career development perspective known as a Psychology of Working (PoW; Blustein in The psychology of working: a new perspective for career development, counseling, and public policy, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, 2006) which is aptly suited to interpreting the career narratives of diverse, non-dominant populations in order to understand the unique STEM career exploration experiences of a group of non-dominant youth. The PoW framework has been modified in response to the developmental context of the youth, specifically, a focus on career expectations as opposed to career experiences, as well as their formal and informal educational experiences, including a National Science Foundation grant-funded STEM program, in which all of the participants were involved. From this study, an understanding has been gained of a number of different universal human needs that, when addressed, were influential on these youth’s STEM career exploration. In particular, social connectedness via STEM career mentorship was identified as most impactful for these youth."

abstract,"Abstract This article reports the findings of a 3-year study of a hybrid professional development program designed to prepare science and mathematics teachers to implement GIS in their classrooms. The study was conducted as part of the CoastLines Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers project funded by the National Science Foundation. Three cohorts of teachers participated in the program, with each participant receiving 40 h of synchronous online instruction and 80 h of in-person instruction and support over an 8-month period. Data from surveys of participants both before and after the program were analyzed using correlation, ordinary least squares, and ordered logit regression analyses. The analyses revealed increases in the self-reported frequency of GIS use and enhanced feelings of preparation, competence, community, and comfort with respect to using GIS for instruction. A composite index of all impact variables was positively influenced as well. The statistical analyses found a strong relationship between self-reported feelings of preparation and use of GIS. Some support was found for the idea that feelings of competence, community, and comfort were related to the teachers’ sense of preparation. The findings suggest that a robust hybrid model of teacher professional development can prepare teachers to use GIS in their classrooms. More research is needed to understand how hybrid models influence the sociopsychological and other dimensions that support teachers’ feelings of preparation to implement GIS."

abstract,"Abstract Research suggests that trajectories toward careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) emerge early and are influenced by multiple factors. This paper presents a longitudinal study, which uses data from 76 high school students to explore how a student’s vocational self-efficacy and interest are related to his or her middle school behavioral and affective engagement. Measures of vocational self-efficacy and interest are drawn from STEM-related scales in CAPAExplore, while measures of middle school performance and engagement in mathematics are drawn from several previously validated automated indicators extracted from logs of student interaction with ASSISTments, an online learning platform. Results  indicate that vocational self-efficacy correlates negatively with confusion, but positively with engaged concentration and carelessness. Interest, which also correlates negatively with confusion, correlates positively with correctness and carelessness. Other disengaged behaviors, such as gaming the system, were not correlated with vocational self-efficacy or interest, despite previous studies indicating that they are associated with future college attendance. We discuss implications for these findings, which have the potential to assist educators or counselors in developing strategies to sustain students’ interest in STEM-related careers."

abstract,"Abstract This paper describes the findings of a pilot study that used robotics and game design to develop middle school students’ computational thinking strategies. One hundred and twenty-four students engaged in LEGO® EV3 robotics and created games using Scalable Game Design software. The results of the study revealed students’ pre–post self-efficacy scores on the construct of computer use declined significantly, while the constructs of videogaming and computer gaming remained unchanged. When these constructs were analyzed by type of learning environment, self-efficacy on videogaming increased significantly in the combined robotics/gaming environment compared with the gaming-only context. Student attitudes toward STEM, however, did not change significantly as a result of the study. Finally, children’s computational thinking (CT) strategies varied by method of instruction as students who participated in holistic game development (i.e., Project First) had higher CT ratings. This study contributes to the STEM education literature on the use of robotics and game design to influence self-efficacy in technology and CT, while informing the research team about the adaptations needed to ensure project fidelity during the remaining years of the study."

The goal of this research was to examine the impact of a short science camp program approximately 1 year after students attended the camp. Overall, the results revealed that attending a 2-day forensic science camp had a positive and continuing influence on the participants. Students’ science self-efficacy increased immediately after attending the camp and remained higher than pre-camp levels approximately 1 year later. Students were able to articulate why they believed the camp had a long-term impact on their lives. Furthermore, participants attributed a higher level of engaging in additional informal STEM-related activities during the academic year as a result of attending the camp."

Students with interests in STEM careers created STEM-focused ePEPs and may have enrolled in STEM career academies, which offered a unique opportunity to improve their preparedness for the STEM workforce through the integration of rigorous academic and career and technical education courses. This study examined persistence of STEM-interested (i.e., those with expressed interest in STEM careers) and STEM-capable (i.e., those who completed at least Algebra 1 in eighth grade) students (n = 11,248), including those enrolled in STEM career academies, in rigorous mathematics and science course taking in Florida public high schools in comparison with the national cohort of STEM-interested students to measure the influence of K-12 STEM education efforts in Florida. With the exception of multi-race students, we found that Florida’s STEM-capable students had lower persistence in rigorous mathematics and science course taking than students in the national cohort from ninth to eleventh grade. We also found that participation in STEM career academies did not support persistence in rigorous mathematics and science courses, a prerequisite for success in postsecondary STEM education and careers."

abstract,"Abstract Early experiences in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are important for getting youth interested in STEM fields, particularly for girls. Here, we explore how an after-school robotics club can provide informal STEM experiences that inspire students to engage with STEM in the future. Human-centered robotics, with its emphasis on the social aspects of science and technology, may be especially important for bringing girls into the STEM pipeline. Using a problem-based approach, we designed two robotics challenges. We focus here on the more extended second challenge, in which participants were asked to imagine and build a telepresence robot that would allow others to explore their space from a distance. This research follows four girls as they engage with human-centered telepresence robotics design. We constructed case studies of these target participants to explore their different forms of engagement and phases of interest development—considering facets of behavioral, social, cognitive, and conceptual-to-consequential engagement as well as stages of interest ranging from triggered interest to well-developed individual interest. The results demonstrated that opportunities to personalize their robots and feedback from peers and facilitators were important motivators. We found both explicit and vicarious engagement and varied interest phases in our group of four focus participants. This first iteration of our project demonstrated that human-centered robotics is a promising approach to getting girls interested and engaged in STEM practices. As we design future iterations of our robotics club environment, we must consider how to harness multiple forms of leadership and engagement without marginalizing students with different working preferences."

abstract,"Abstract Access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields serves as a key entry point to economic mobility and civic enfranchisement. Such access must take seriously the intellectual power of the knowledge and practices of non-dominant youth. In our case, this has meant to shift epistemic authority in mathematics from academic institutions to young people themselves. This article is about why high school-aged students, from underrepresented groups, choose to participate in an out-of-school time program in which they teach younger children in the domains of mathematics and computer science. It argues for programmatic principles based on access, identity engagement, relationship building, and connections to community to support underrepresented youth as learners, teachers, leaders, and organizers in mathematics-related activities using game design as the focus of activity."

abstract,"Abstract For over a decade, the National Science Foundation’s Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program has funded researchers and educators to build an understanding of best practices, contexts, and processes contributing to K-12 students’ motivation and participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) activities that lead to STEM career pathways. The outcomes from these projects have contributed significantly to the national body of knowledge about strategies, successes, models, and interventions that support and encourage youth to pursue STEM careers. While the individual projects discussed in this special issue vary by geographic location, institution, populations served, primary focus, and topic, they are unified by ITEST’s programmatic intent and goals. This issue offers research-based insights into the knowledge generated by a decade of ITEST-funded work in STEM career development. The articles describe a multitude of approaches to project design, evaluation, and empirical research. Collectively, they contribute to the development of frameworks for STEM education and workforce development that are increasingly relevant for educators, project designers, researchers, and policy makers. The ITEST program has enabled creativity, experimentation, and cultural responsiveness in STEM education and workforce development and broadened participation in STEM initiatives to Native American communities, underresourced urban communities, girls, and populations underrepresented in STEM fields. By approaching research and evaluation with flexibility and resourcefulness, the authors provide empirical evidence for the value of innovative approaches to STEM education that promote STEM interest and career-related outcomes and that build the foundational skills of the scientific and engineering workforce of the future."

This study reports on the development, delivery, and outcomes of a culturally driven science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) program, iSTEM, aimed at increasing engagement in STEM learning among Native American 3rd–8th grade students. A culturally relevant theoretical framework, Funds of Knowledge, informs the iSTEM program, a program based on the contention that the synergistic effect of a hybrid program combining two strategic approaches (1) in-school mentoring and (2) out-of-school informal science education experiences would foster engagement and interest in STEM learning. Students are paired with one of three types of mentors: Native American community members, university students, and STEM professionals. The iSTEM program is theme based with all program activities specifically relevant to Native people living in southern Arizona. Student mentees and mentors complete interactive flash STEM activities at lunch hour and attend approximately six field trips per year. Data from the iSTEM program indicate that the program has been successful in engaging Native American students in iSTEM as well as increasing their interest in STEM and their science beliefs."

abstract,"Abstract This article describes Energy for ME and Going Green! Middle Schoolers Out to Save the World, two Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education programs with the common goal of improving students’ attitudes about scientific careers. The authors represent two project teams, each with funding from the National Science Foundation’s ITEST program. Using different approaches and technology, both projects challenged students to use electricity monitoring system data to create action plans for conserving energy in their homes and communities. The impact of each project on students’ career interests was assessed via a multi-method evaluation that included the Career Interest Questionnaire (CIQ), a measure that was validated within the context of ITEST projects and has since become one of the instruments used most commonly across the ITEST community. This article explores the extent to which the CIQ can be used to document the effects of technology-enhanced STEM educational experiences on students’ career attitudes and intentions in different environments. The results indicate that the CIQ, and the Intent subscale in particular, served as significant predictors of students’ self-reported STEM career aspirations across project context. Results  from each project also demonstrated content gains by students and demonstrated the impact of project participation and gender on student outcomes. The authors conclude that the CIQ is a useful tool for providing empirical evidence to document the impact of technology-enhanced science education programs, particularly with regard to Intent to purse a STEM career. The need for additional cross-project comparison studies is also discussed."

The groups were compared with respect to amount and frequency of access to different online course resources. It was found that with few exceptions, both groups exhibited very similar work habits. Students in the online sections more frequently accessed content pages and more frequently contributed to course discussions. It was also found that regular access of the materials throughout the week, rather than only on homework deadline nights, is a predictor of success on examinations, and that this indicator is more reliable for students in the online sections. Overall, though, the effect of traditional lectures is minimal."

A national survey of fossil group representatives and professional paleontologists was used to address the research questions. The results provide a rich description of the attributes and activities of both groups and are discussed in terms of three design principles for supporting the two groups in a form of collaboration and fellowship via a coherent shared practice within an online learning community."

abstract,"Abstract Mobile serious educational games (SEGs) show promise for promoting scientific practices and high engagement. Researchers have quantified this engagement according to flow theory. This study investigated whether a mobile SEG promotes flow experience and scientific practices with eighth-grade urban students. Students playing the game (n = 59) were compared with students in a business-as-usual control activity (n = 120). In both scenarios, students worked in small teams. Data measures included an open-ended instrument designed to measure scientific practices, a self-report flow survey, and classroom observations. The game players had significantly higher levels of flow and scientific practices compared to the control group. Observations revealed that game teams received less whole-class instruction and review compared to the control teams. Game teachers had primarily a guide-on-the-side role when facilitating the game, while control teachers predominantly used didactic instruction when facilitating the control activity. Implications for these findings are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Students in a first-semester general chemistry course at a large southwestern university completed a 3-week homework assignment using MindTap, a Cengage Learning product. MindTap is the first major electronic system that has homework questions embedded in the text, such that students read a short section of the textbook and then answer a question set. Prior to MindTap, electronic homework systems were stand-alone or contained questions with links to the textbook. Next, students completed two 2-week homework assignments in Online Web Learning (OWL) version 1 also from Cengage Learning. The OWL system shows homework questions with a link to the textbook in a separate window. Both the MindTap and OWL systems contain the same or similar questions. After the students used both homework systems, a survey was given that included Likert-scaled and open-response questions that dealt with students’ perceived level of understanding using the different systems, how easy the systems were to use, and the advantages/disadvantages of each system. A delayed survey was given at the end of the second semester of general chemistry, during which students had used OWL for the complete semester. This paper investigates the effects of the arrangement (embedded vs. linked) on student preferences and perceived learning in this pilot study with a 300-person class. Based on the results of the study, it was found that students perceived that they learn more with MindTap and prefer the embedded text in MindTap over the linked text in OWL."

abstract,"Abstract Teachers choosing between different models to facilitate students’ understanding of an abstract system must decide whether to adopt a model that is simplified and striking or one that is realistic and complex. Only recently have instructional technologies enabled teachers and learners to change presentations swiftly and to provide for learning based on multiple models, thus giving rise to questions about the order of presentation. Using disjoint individual growth modeling to examine the learning of astronomical concepts using a simulation of the solar system on tablets for 152 high school students (age 15), the authors detect both a model effect and an order effect in the use of the Orrery, a simplified model that exaggerates the scale relationships, and the True-to-scale, a proportional model that more accurately represents the realistic scale relationships. Specifically, earlier exposure to the simplified model resulted in diminution of the conceptual gain from the subsequent realistic model, but the realistic model did not impede learning from the following simplified model."

abstract,"Abstract Recently, the inverted instruction methodologies are gaining attentions in higher educations by claiming that flipping the classroom engages more effectively students with the learning process. Besides, students’ perceptions and emotions involved in their learning process must be assessed in order to gauge the usability of this relatively new instruction methodology, since it is vital in the educational formation. For this reason, this study intends to evaluate the students’ perceptions and emotions when a flipped classroom setting is used as instruction methodology. This research was conducted in a general science course, sophomore of the Primary Education bachelor degree in the Training Teaching School of the University of Extremadura (Spain). The results show that the students have the overall positive perceptions to a flipped classroom setting. Particularly, over 80 % of them considered that the course was a valuable learning experience. They also found this course more interactive and were willing to have more courses following a flipped model. According to the students’ emotions toward a flipped classroom course, the highest scores were given to the positive emotions, being fun and enthusiasm along with keyword frequency test. Then, the lowest scores were corresponded to negative emotions, being boredom and fear. Therefore, the students attending to a flipped course demonstrated to have more positive and less negative emotions. The results obtained in this study allow drawing a promising tendency about the students’ perceptions and emotions toward the flipped classroom methodology and will contribute to fully frame this relatively new instruction methodology."

abstract,"Abstract Chemistry knowledge can be represented at macro-, micro- and symbolic levels, and learning a chemistry topic requires students to engage in multiple representational activities. This study focused on scaffolding for inter-level connection-making in learning chemistry knowledge with graphical simulations. We also tested whether different sequences of representational activities produced different student learning outcomes in learning a chemistry topic. A sample of 129 seventh graders participated in this study. In a simulation-based environment, participants completed three representational activities to learn several ideal gas law concepts. We conducted a 2 × 3 factorial design experiment. We compared two scaffolding conditions: (1) the inter-level scaffolding condition in which participants received inter-level questions and experienced the dynamic link function in the simulation-based environment and (2) the intra-level scaffolding condition in which participants received intra-level questions and did not experience the dynamic link function. We also compared three different sequences of representational activities: macro-symbolic-micro, micro-symbolic-macro and symbolic-micro-macro. For the scaffolding variable, we found that the inter-level scaffolding condition produced significantly better performance in both knowledge comprehension and application, compared to the intra-level scaffolding condition. For the sequence variable, we found that the macro-symbolic-micro sequence produced significantly better knowledge comprehension performance than the other two sequences; however, it did not benefit knowledge application performance. There was a trend that the treatment group who experienced inter-level scaffolding and the micro-symbolic-macro sequence achieved the best knowledge application performance."

To better understand how and why women might shift toward STEM, particularly computer science, careers, we investigated the education and career direction of afterschool facilitators, primarily women of color in their twenties and thirties, who taught Build IT, an afterschool computer science curriculum for middle school girls. Many of these women indicated that implementing Build IT had influenced their own interest in technology and computer science and in some cases had resulted in their intent to pursue technology and computer science education. We wanted to explore the role that teaching Build IT may have played in activating or reactivating interest in careers in computer science and to see whether in the years following implementation of Build IT, these women pursued STEM education and/or careers. We reached nine facilitators who implemented the program in 2011–12 or shortly after. Many indicated that while facilitating Build IT, they learned along with the participants, increasing their interest in and confidence with technology and computer science. Seven of the nine participants pursued further STEM or computer science learning or modified their career paths to include more of a STEM or computer science focus. Through interviews, we explored what aspects of Build IT influenced these facilitators’ interest and confidence in STEM and when relevant their pursuit of technology and computer science education and careers."

abstract,"Abstract In recent years, interactive computer simulations have been progressively integrated in the teaching of the sciences and have contributed significant improvements in the teaching–learning process. Practicing problem-solving is a key factor in science and engineering education. The aim of this study was to design simulation-based problem-solving teaching materials and assess their effectiveness in improving students’ ability to solve problems in university-level physics. Firstly, we analyze the effect of using simulation-based materials in the development of students’ skills in employing procedures that are typically used in the scientific method of problem-solving. We found that a significant percentage of the experimental students used expert-type scientific procedures such as qualitative analysis of the problem, making hypotheses, and analysis of results. At the end of the course, only a minority of the students persisted with habits based solely on mathematical equations. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness in terms of problem-solving of the experimental group students with the students who are taught conventionally. We found that the implementation of the problem-solving strategy improved experimental students’ results regarding obtaining a correct solution from the academic point of view, in standard textbook problems. Thirdly, we explore students’ satisfaction with simulation-based problem-solving teaching materials and we found that the majority appear to be satisfied with the methodology proposed and took on a favorable attitude to learning problem-solving. The research was carried out among first-year Engineering Degree students."

abstract,"Abstract There is a growing demand for degreed science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals, but the production of degreed STEM students is not keeping pace. Problems exist at every juncture along the pipeline. Too few students choose to major in STEM disciplines. Many of those who do major in STEM drop out or change majors. Females and minorities remain underrepresented in STEM. The success rate of college students who are from low-income background or first-generation students is much lower than that of students who do not face such challenges. Some of those who successfully complete their degree need help in making the transition to the workforce after graduation. A program at Lamar University takes a multidisciplinary approach to addressing these problems. It is designed to recruit, retain and transition undergraduates to careers in STEM, focusing its efforts on five science disciplines and on these “at-risk” students. The program was supported by a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation and is supported through August 31, 2016 by Lamar University and a grant from ExxonMobil. A formal assessment plan documents the program’s success. The program received an award from the Texas Higher Education Board for its contributions towards Closing the Gaps in Higher Education in Texas. This paper describes the program’s theoretical framework, research questions, methods, evaluation plan, and instruments. It presents an analysis of the results achieved using these methods and implications for improvements to the program resulting from lessons learned."

No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest–posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students’ achievement and improve their attitude."

abstract,"Abstract Classroom response systems (often referred to as “clickers”) have slowly gained adoption over the recent decade; however, critics frequently doubt their pedagogical value starting with the validity of the gathered responses: There is concern that students simply “click” random answers. This case study looks at different measures of response reliability, starting from a global look at correlations between formative clicker responses and summative examination performance to how clicker questions are used in context. It was found that clicker performance is a moderate indicator of course performance as a whole, and that while the psychometric properties of clicker items are more erratic than those of examination data, they still have acceptable internal consistency and include items with high discrimination. It was also found that clicker responses and item properties do provide highly meaningful feedback within a lecture context, i.e., when their position and function within lecture sessions are taken into consideration. Within this framework, conceptual questions provide measurably more meaningful feedback than items that require calculations."

abstract,"Abstract In many countries around the world, there has been an increasing emphasis on improving science education. Recent reform efforts in the USA call for teachers to integrate scientific and engineering practices into science teaching; for example, science teachers are asked to provide learning experiences for students that apply crosscutting concepts (e.g., patterns, scale) and increase understanding of disciplinary core ideas (e.g., physical science, earth science). Engineering practices and engineering design are essential elements of this new vision of science teaching and learning. This paper presents a research study that evaluates the effects of an engineering design-based science curriculum on student learning and attitudes. Three middle school life science teachers and 275 seventh grade students participated in the study. Content assessments and attitude surveys were administered before and after the implementation of the curriculum unit. Statewide mathematics test proficiency scores were included in the data analysis as well. Results  provide evidence of the positive effects of implementing the engineering design-based science unit on student attitudes and learning."

Students, however, often have difficulty learning these components, and limited research exists to understand what types of interventions may best help improve understanding. We investigated 32 high school students’ understandings of complex systems components and whether an agent-based simulation could improve their understandings. Pretest and posttest essays were coded for changes in six components to determine whether students showed more expert thinking about the complex system of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Results  showed significant improvement for the components Emergence (r = .26, p = .03), Order (r = .37, p = .002), and Tradeoffs (r = .44, p = .001). Implications include that the experiential nature of the simulation has the potential to support conceptual change for some complex systems components, presenting a promising option for complex systems instruction."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we investigate an approach to supporting students’ learning in science through a combination of physical experimentation and virtual modeling. We present a study that utilizes a scientific inquiry framework, which we call “bifocal modeling,” to link student-designed experiments and computer models in real time. In this study, a group of high school students designed computer models of bacterial growth with reference to a simultaneous physical experiment they were conducting, and were able to validate the correctness of their model against the results of their experiment. Our findings suggest that as the students compared their virtual models with physical experiments, they encountered “discrepant events” that contradicted their existing conceptions and elicited a state of cognitive disequilibrium. This experience of conflict encouraged students to further examine their ideas and to seek more accurate explanations of the observed natural phenomena, improving the design of their computer models."

abstract,"Abstract Anatomy is a foundational component of biological sciences and medical education and is important for a variety of clinical tasks. To augment current curriculum and improve students’ spatial knowledge of anatomy, many educators, anatomists, and researchers use three-dimensional (3D) visualization technologies. This article reviews 3D display technologies and their associated assessments for anatomical education. In the first segment, the review covers the general function of displays employing 3D techniques. The second segment of the review highlights the use and assessment of 3D technology in anatomical education, focusing on factors such as knowledge gains, student perceptions, and cognitive load. The review found 32 articles on the use of 3D displays in anatomical education and another 38 articles on the assessment of 3D displays. The review shows that the majority (74 %) of studies indicate that the use of 3D is beneficial for many tasks in anatomical education, and that student perceptions are positive toward the technology."

abstract,"Abstract 
This paper describes a qualitative study that investigated the nature of the participation structures and how the participation structures were organized by four science teachers when they constructed and communicated science content in their classrooms with computer technology. Participation structures focus on the activity structures and processes in social settings like classrooms thereby providing glimpses into the complex dynamics of teacher–students interactions, configurations, and conventions during collective meaning making and knowledge creation. Data included observations, interviews, and focus group interviews. Analysis revealed that the dominant participation structure evident within participants’ instruction with computer technology was (Teacher) initiation–(Student and Teacher) response sequences–(Teacher) evaluate participation structure. Three key events characterized the how participants organized this participation structure in their classrooms: setting the stage for interactive instruction, the joint activity, and maintaining accountability. Implications include the following: (1) teacher educators need to tap into the knowledge base that underscores science teachers’ learning to teach philosophies when computer technology is used in instruction. (2) Teacher educators need to emphasize the essential idea that learning and cognition is not situated within the computer technology but within the pedagogical practices, specifically the participation structures. (3) The pedagogical practices developed with the integration or with the use of computer technology underscored by the teachers’ own knowledge of classroom contexts and curriculum needs to be the focus for how students learn science content with computer technology instead of just focusing on how computer technology solely supports students learning of science content."

abstract,"Abstract The Moodle platform has been used to put into practice an ongoing evaluation of the students’ Physics learning process. The evaluation has been done on the frame of the course General Physics, which is lectured during the first year of the Physics, Mathematics and Electronic Engineering Programmes at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). A test bank with more than 1000 multiple-choice questions, including conceptual and numerical problems, has been prepared. Throughout the course, the students have to answer a 10-question multiple-choice test for every one of the blocks the course is divided in and which were previously treated and worked in the theoretical lectures and problem-solving sessions. The tests are automatically corrected by Moodle, and under certain criteria, the corresponding mark is taken into account for the final mark of the course. According to the results obtained from a statistical study of the data on the student performances during the last four academic years, it has been observed that there exists an actual correlation between the marks obtained in the Moodle tests and the final mark of the course. In addition, it could be deduced that students who have passed the Moodle tests increase their possibilities of passing the course by an odds ratio close to 3."

abstract,"Abstract Interpreting and creating graphs plays a critical role in scientific practice. The K-12 Next Generation Science Standards call for students to use graphs for scientific modeling, reasoning, and communication. To measure progress on this dimension, we need valid and reliable measures of graph understanding in science. In this research, we designed items to measure graph comprehension, critique, and construction and developed scoring rubrics based on the knowledge integration (KI) framework. We administered the items to over 460 middle school students. We found that the items formed a coherent scale and had good reliability using both item response theory and classical test theory. The KI scoring rubric showed that most students had difficulty linking graphs features to science concepts, especially when asked to critique or construct graphs. In addition, students with limited access to computers as well as those who speak a language other than English at home have less integrated understanding than others. These findings point to the need to increase the integration of graphing into science instruction. The results suggest directions for further research leading to comprehensive assessments of graph understanding."

abstract,"Abstract Previous research has suggested that the ability to recognize vocal portrayals of socio-emotional expressions improves with age throughout childhood and adolescence. The current study examined whether stimulus-level factors (i.e., the age of the speaker and the type of expression being conveyed) interacted with listeners’ developmental stage to predict listeners’ recognition accuracy. We assessed mid-adolescent (n = 50, aged 13–15 years) and adult (n = 87, 18–30 years) listeners’ ability to recognize basic emotions and social expressions in the voices of both adult and youth actors. Adults’ emotional prosody was better recognized than that of youth, and adult listeners were more accurate overall than were mid-adolescents. Interaction effects revealed that youths’ accuracy was equivalent to adult listeners’ when hearing adult portrayals of anger, disgust, friendliness, happiness, and meanness, and youth portrayals of disgust, happiness, and meanness. Our findings highlight the importance of speaker characteristics and type of expression on listeners’ ability to recognize vocal cues of emotion and social intent."

abstract,"Abstract We investigated how the visibility of targets influenced the type of point used to provide directions. In Study 1, we asked 605 passersby in three localities for directions to well-known local landmarks. When that landmark was in plain view behind the requester, most respondents pointed with their index fingers, and few respondents pointed more than once. In contrast, when the landmark was not in view, respondents pointed initially with their index fingers, but often elaborated with a whole-hand point. In Study 2, we covertly filmed the responses from 157 passersby we approached for directions, capturing both verbal and gestural responses. As in Study 1, few respondents produced more than one gesture when the target was in plain view and initial points were most likely to be index finger points. Thus, in a Western geographical context in which pointing with the index finger is the dominant form of pointing, a slight change in circumstances elicited a preference for pointing with the whole hand when it was the second or third manual gesture in a sequence."

abstract,"Abstract Speakers routinely produce gestures when conveying verbal information such as route directions. This study examined developmental differences in spontaneous gesture and its connection with speech when recalling route directions. Children aged 3–4 years and adults were taken on a novel walk around their preschool or university and asked to verbally recall this route, as well as a route they take regularly (e.g., from home to university, or home to a park). Both children and adults primarily produced iconic (enacting) and deictic (pointing) gestures, as well as gestures that contained both iconic and deictic elements. For adults, deictic gestures typically accompanied phrases both with description (e.g., go around the green metal gate) and without description (e.g., go around the gate). For children, phrases with description were more frequently accompanied by iconic gestures, and phrases without description were more frequently accompanied by deictic gestures. Furthermore, children used gesture to convey additional information not present in speech content more often than did adults, particularly for phrases without description."

abstract,"Abstract Research on interpersonal synchronization deals with the coordination of behavior, cognition and affect within interacting individuals. The phenomenon of synchronization has been explored in many settings and numerous definitions have emerged. The purpose of this study was to compare nonverbal synchrony (based on overall body movement) with the concept of complementarity (based on interpersonal theory) in a competitive context. We examined 40 previously unacquainted same-sex dyads (21 female, 19 male; mean age = 22.81). Dyads underwent a 15-min videotaped competitive role-play. Nonverbal synchrony was quantified by a frame-differencing method, and complementarity by a joystick tracking method. Results  revealed that dyads behaved in a synchronous and complementary manner. We found that nonverbal synchrony was positively correlated with affiliation complementarity, but not dominance complementarity. The present study compared nonverbal synchrony with complementarity. The link between the two concepts was small, as indicated by rather weak correlations between nonverbal synchrony and affiliation complementarity. Our results reinforce the view that competitive behavior depends on complex dyadic interactions, including nonverbal and verbal behavior."

Thus, we investigated children’s knowledge of the facial components involved in the expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. Four- and 5-year-old Japanese children were presented with the blank face of a young character, and asked to select facial components in order to depict the emotions he felt. Children’s overall performance in the task increased as a function of age, and was above chance level for each emotion in both age groups. Children were likely to select the Cheek raiser and Lip corner puller to depict happiness, the Inner brow raiser, Brow lowerer, and Lid droop to depict sadness, the Brow lowerer and Upper lid raiser to depict anger, and the Upper lid raiser and Jaw drop to depict surprise. Furthermore, older children demonstrated a better knowledge of the involvement of the Upper lid raiser in surprise expressions."

abstract,"Abstract Cross-sectional studies support negative associations between children’s skills in recognizing emotional expressions and their problem behaviors. Few studies have examined these associations over time, however, precluding our understanding of the direction of effects. Emotion recognition difficulties may contribute to the development of problem behaviors; additionally, problem behaviors may constrain the development of emotion recognition skill. The present study tested the bidirectional linkages between children’s emotion recognition and teacher-reported problem behaviors in 1st and 3rd grade. Specifically, emotion recognition, hyperactivity, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors were assessed in 117 children in 1st grade and in 3rd grade. Results  from fully cross-lagged path models revealed divergent developmental patterns: Controlling for concurrent levels of problem behaviors and first-grade receptive language skills, lower emotion recognition in 1st grade significantly predicted greater internalizing behaviors, but not hyperactivity or externalizing behaviors, in 3rd grade. Moreover, greater hyperactivity in 1st grade marginally predicted lower emotion recognition in 3rd grade, but internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not predictive of emotion recognition over time. Together, these findings extend previous research to identify specific developmental pathways, whereby emotion recognition difficulties contribute to the development of internalizing behaviors, and early hyperactivity may contribute to the development of emotion recognition difficulties, thus highlighting the importance of examining these processes and their mutual development over time."

abstract,"Abstract Using one of the key bibliometric methods, namely the index of citations, from a comprehensive multidisciplinary bibliographic electronic database, Web of Science, this article provides a circumscribed descriptive analysis of 1000 most-cited papers in the research field of visible nonverbal behavior. Using this method, we outline the most influential topics and research programs, and sketch the development of relevant features over the years. Topics include nonverbal behavior, facial expression, personal space, gesture, thin slices, and others, but exclude vocal or auditory cues. The results show that the 1000 most cited papers on visible nonverbal behavior emerged in the 1960s, and peaked in 2008. Revealing the strong interdisciplinary nature of the field, the 1000 papers come from 297 journals. Further, 33 journals had 7 or more papers, contributing to more than 50% (n = 515) of the 1000 most cited papers. The most cited paper (Whalen et al. in Emotion 1(1):70–83, 2001.  https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.256, a neuroscience paper) is cited 1341 times, and Paul Ekman has the highest number of papers (17) as first or last author. Results  are compared with two other corpora of papers (i.e., a random sample control group and a current papers group) to provide a more thorough understanding of possible future directions in visible nonverbal behavior. Results  differ from those that emerge from other citation indexes and are intended to give a flavor of key peer reviewed papers (excluding books and chapters) contributing to the development of scientific knowledge on visible nonverbal behavior."

history,['2018-03-26']
abstract,"Abstract Facial symmetry is an index of developmental stability and shows a positive correlation with attractiveness assessment. However, the appearance of one’s facial symmetry is not always static and may change when there is facial movement while a person is speaking. This study examined whether viewing a dynamic image of a person speaking (where facial symmetry may alter) would elicit a different perception of attractiveness than viewing a static image of that person as a still photo. We examined changes in both measured and perceived facial symmetry in relation to attractiveness perception. We found that when facial movements created an appearance of overall greater facial symmetry while a person was speaking in a video, the person was rated as being more attractive than as a still photo. Likewise, those with facial movements measured and perceived as less symmetrical while speaking were rated as less attractive in a video clip than still photo. By examining the perception of faces in motion as we typically encounter others in real life rather than considering only static photos, we have extended the ecological validity of the study of the perception of bilateral symmetry in humans as it relates to attractiveness."

history,['2018-03-26']
abstract,"Abstract Observing hand gestures during learning consistently benefits learners across a variety of tasks. How observation of gestures benefits learning, however, is yet unanswered, and cannot be answered without further understanding which types of gestures aid learning. Specifically, the effects of observing varying types of iconic gestures are yet to be established. Across two studies we examined the role that observing different types of iconic hand gestures has in assisting adult narrative comprehension. Some iconic hand gestures (typical gestures) were produced more frequently than others (atypical gestures). Crucially, observing these different types of gestures during a narrative comprehension task did not provide equal benefit for comprehension. Rather, observing typical gestures significantly enhanced narrative comprehension beyond observing atypical gestures or no gestures. We argue that iconic gestures may be split into separate categories of typical and atypical gestures, which in turn have differential effects on narrative comprehension."

history,['2018-03-26']
abstract,"Abstract This research investigated the influence of observed touch on the perceptions of communality and dominance in dyadic interactions. We manipulated four key situational features of haptic behavior in two experiments: the initiation, reciprocity, the degree of formality of touch (Studies 1 and 2), and the context of the interaction (Study 2). The results showed that the default perception of touch, irrespective of whether it is initiated or reciprocated, is the communal intention of the toucher. Furthermore, the initiation of touch was seen as an act of dominance, particularly, when the contact between the actors was primed as being hierarchical. Reciprocation neutralized the perceived asymmetry in dominance, but such inferences seemed to hinge on the fit of the touch with the context: reciprocation of formal touch reduced the asymmetry in the hierarchical context, whereas reciprocation of informal touch reduced the asymmetry in the non-hierarchical context."

In the present study, we assessed 32 younger and 30 older adults’ accuracy when perceiving (1) static facial expressions, (2) emotions, attitudes, and intentions from videos, (3) and interpersonal constructs (e.g., kinship). Participants’ conversation ability was rated by coders from a videotaped, dyadic problem-solving task. Younger adults were more accurate than older adults perceiving some but not all emotions. No age differences in accuracy were found on any perception task or in conversation ability. Some but not all of the interpersonal perception tasks were related. None of the perception tasks predicted conversation ability. Thus, although the literature suggests a robust age difference in emotion perception accuracy, this difference does not seem to transfer to other interpersonal perception tasks or interpersonal outcomes."

abstract,"Abstract Previous research suggested that real-world lies are detected through hard evidence, such as physical evidence or a direct confession, and not via nonverbal clues. However, we argue that discovering a lie is a process, and nonverbal clues are an important source of information that can induce suspicion, which then triggers the search for hard evidence. We replicated an original study suggesting the irrelevance of nonverbal clues, but experimentally manipulated the wording of the critical question as ‘discovering’ a lie versus ‘suspecting’ a lie. A second study was conducted that further manipulated the phrasing to ask about ‘events’ versus ‘clues’ that led one to detect the lie. Results  of both studies showed that those asked about suspecting a lie cited nonverbal behaviors significantly more often than those asked about discovering a lie. Thus, in contrast to previous research, these findings suggest the importance of behavioral clues (e.g. verbal and nonverbal behavior), specifically in the early stage of lie detection."

history,"['2018-03', '2017-09-25']"
abstract,"Abstract Socially anxiety may be related to a different pattern of facial mimicry and contagion of others’ emotions. We report two studies in which participants with different levels of social anxiety reacted to others’ emotional displays, either shown on a computer screen (Study 1) or in an actual social interaction (Study 2). Study 1 examined facial mimicry and emotional contagion in response to displays of happiness, anger, fear, and contempt. Participants mimicked negative and positive emotions to some extent, but we found no relation between mimicry and the social anxiety level of the participants. Furthermore, socially anxious individuals were more prone to experience negative emotions and felt more irritated in response to negative emotion displays. In Study 2, we found that social anxiety was related to enhanced mimicry of smiling, but this was only the case for polite smiles and not for enjoyment smiles. These results suggest that socially anxious individuals tend to catch negative emotions from others, but suppress their expression by mimicking positive displays. This may be explained by the tendency of socially anxious individuals to avoid conflict or rejection."

abstract,"Abstract The facial feedback hypothesis states that facial actions modulate subjective experiences of emotion. Using the voluntary facial action technique, in which the participants react with instruction induced smiles and frowns when exposed to positive and negative emotional pictures and then rate the pleasantness of these stimuli, four questions were addressed in the present study. The results in Experiment 1 demonstrated a feedback effect because participants experienced the stimuli as more pleasant during smiling as compared to when frowning. However, this effect was present only during the critical actions of smiling and frowning, with no remaining effects after 5 min or after 1 day. In Experiment 2, feedback effects were found only when the facial action (smile/frown) was incongruent with the presented emotion (positive/negative), demonstrating attenuating but not enhancing modulation. Finally, no difference in the intensity of produced feedback effect was found between smiling and frowning, and no difference in feedback effect was found between positive and negative emotions. In conclusion, facial feedback appears to occur mainly during actual facial actions, and primarily attenuate ongoing emotional states."

history,"['2018-03', '2017-09-09']"
abstract,"Abstract In face-to-face communication, eye gaze is known to play various roles such as managing the attention of interlocutors, expressing intimacy, exercising social control, highlighting particular speech content, and coordinating floor apportionment. For second language (L2) communication, one’s perception of eye gaze is expected to have more importance than for native language (L1) because eye gaze is assumed to partially compensate for the deficiencies of verbal expressions. This paper examines and clarifies the efficiency of the function of eye gaze in the coordination of floor apportionment through quantitative analyses of eye gaze during three-party conversations in L1 and L2. Specifically, the authors conducted ANOVA tests on the eye-gaze statistics of a speaker and two listeners during utterances while focusing on whether floor-switch occurs subsequent to the utterance. The analysis results show that the listener who is gazed at more by the speaker is more likely to be the next speaker with a higher probability in L2 than in L1 conversations. Meanwhile, the listeners gaze more at the speaker in L2 than in L1 conversation for both the utterances just before a floor switch and cases with no floor switch. These results support the observation that the eye gaze of the speaker is efficient for floor apportionment in L2 conversations and suggest that longer listeners’ eye gazes in L2 conversations also function efficiently in smooth floor apportionment."

abstract,"Abstract Recent research on human nonverbal vocalizations has led to considerable progress in our understanding of vocal communication of emotion. However, in contrast to studies of animal vocalizations, this research has focused mainly on the emotional interpretation of such signals. The repertoire of human nonverbal vocalizations as acoustic types, and the mapping between acoustic and emotional categories, thus remain underexplored. In a cross-linguistic naming task (Experiment 1), verbal categorization of 132 authentic (non-acted) human vocalizations by English-, Swedish- and Russian-speaking participants revealed the same major acoustic types: laugh, cry, scream, moan, and possibly roar and sigh. The association between call type and perceived emotion was systematic but non-redundant: listeners associated every call type with a limited, but in some cases relatively wide, range of emotions. The speed and consistency of naming the call type predicted the speed and consistency of inferring the caller’s emotion, suggesting that acoustic and emotional categorizations are closely related. However, participants preferred to name the call type before naming the emotion. Furthermore, nonverbal categorization of the same stimuli in a triad classification task (Experiment 2) was more compatible with classification by call type than by emotion, indicating the former’s greater perceptual salience. These results suggest that acoustic categorization may precede attribution of emotion, highlighting the need to distinguish between the overt form of nonverbal signals and their interpretation by the perceiver. Both within- and between-call acoustic variation can then be modeled explicitly, bringing research on human nonverbal vocalizations more in line with the work on animal communication."

abstract,"Abstract It has been the subject of much debate in the study of vocal expression of emotions whether posed expressions (e.g., actor portrayals) are different from spontaneous expressions. In the present investigation, we assembled a new database consisting of 1877 voice clips from 23 datasets, and used it to systematically compare spontaneous and posed expressions across 3 experiments. Results  showed that (a) spontaneous expressions were generally rated as more genuinely emotional than were posed expressions, even when controlling for differences in emotion intensity, (b) there were differences between the two stimulus types with regard to their acoustic characteristics, and (c) spontaneous expressions with a high emotion intensity conveyed discrete emotions to listeners to a similar degree as has previously been found for posed expressions, supporting a dose–response relationship between intensity of expression and discreteness in perceived emotions. Our conclusion is that there are reliable differences between spontaneous and posed expressions, though not necessarily in the ways commonly assumed. Implications for emotion theories and the use of emotion portrayals in studies of vocal expression are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Social status hierarchies are a universal principle of organization in human societies. Status judgments are often influenced by perceptions of the face and posture. Two important nonverbal cues of social status are head postures and eye gaze. Prior research has shown contradictory results and little is known about the interaction of these two cues. Study 1 investigated how eye gaze (direct vs. averted) and head postures (bowed vs. neutral vs. raised) impact judgments of dominance and physical strength. Judgments of dominance were influenced more than judgments of physical strength. Furthermore, raised heads implied dominance and strength, but in contrast to common assumptions, a bowed head conveyed dominance if the eyes gazed at the observer. Study 2 showed that bowed heads with direct gaze conveyed anger, potentially explaining the increased judgments of dominance. Taken together, the results show that head posture and gaze interactively modulated status-related traits and emotions, namely, dominance, strength, and anger, and help clarify prior incompatible findings on head postures and eye gaze."

abstract,"Abstract One of the most prevalent problems in face transplant patients is an inability to generate facial expression of emotions. The purpose of this study was to measure the subjective recognition of patients’ emotional expressions by other people. We examined facial expression of six emotions in two facial transplant patients (patient A = partial, patient B = full) and one healthy control using video clips to evoke emotions. We recorded target subjects’ facial expressions with a video camera while they were watching the clips. These were then shown to a panel of 130 viewers and rated in terms of degree of emotional expressiveness on a 7-point Likert scale. The scores for emotional expressiveness were higher for the healthy control than they were for patients A and B, and these varied as a function of emotion. The most recognizable emotion was happiness. The least recognizable emotions in Patient A were fear, surprise, and anger. The expressions of Patient B scored lower than those of Patient A and the healthy control. The findings show that partial and full-face transplant patients may have difficulties in generating facial expression of emotions even if they can feel those emotions, and different parts of the face seem to play critical roles in different emotional expressions."

abstract,"Abstract In face-to-face communication, speakers typically integrate information acquired through different sources, including what they see and what they know, into their communicative messages. In this study, we asked how these different input sources influence the frequency and type of iconic gestures produced by speakers during a communication task, under two degrees of task complexity. Specifically, we investigated whether speakers gestured differently when they had to describe an object presented to them as an image or as a written word (input modality) and, additionally, when they were allowed to explicitly name the object or not (task complexity). Our results show that speakers produced more gestures when they attended to a picture. Further, speakers more often gesturally depicted shape information when attended to an image, and they demonstrated the function of an object more often when they attended to a word. However, when we increased the complexity of the task by forbidding speakers to name the target objects, these patterns disappeared, suggesting that speakers may have strategically adapted their use of iconic strategies to better meet the task’s goals. Our study also revealed (independent) effects of object manipulability on the type of gestures produced by speakers and, in general, it highlighted a predominance of molding and handling gestures. These gestures may reflect stronger motoric and haptic simulations, lending support to activation-based gesture production accounts."

abstract,"Abstract Despite previous evidence identifying the role of ethnic and gender differences in nonverbal communication, few studies have comprehensively investigated the role of these factors in the effect of handshake on appraisals of social interactions. Here, 88 young adults (with equal proportions of Caucasians and East Asians, and women and men) observed and evaluated a series of movies illustrating guest–host interactions in a business setting. Each interaction started with a greeting protocol initiated by the host, which, in half of the trials, involved a handshake. The greeting was followed by a display of behaviors either encouraging (approach) or discouraging (avoidance) further interaction. Ethnicity and gender of the hosts were manipulated to depict the same categories represented by participants. First, the effect of handshake on appraisals of social interactions was more positive in Caucasian than in East Asian participants. Second, the effect of handshake on appraisals of social interactions was more positive for male than for female hosts in male participants, whereas such differences were not observed in female participants. Third, appraisals of social interactions involving approach and avoidance behaviors were more positive in Caucasian than in East Asian participants. Finally, appraisals of social interactions involving approach behaviors were more positive in female than in male participants. Overall, these findings shed light on the role of ethnic and gender differences in the appraisal of nonverbal behaviors, and extend our understanding of factors that may lead to successful social interaction in the context of growing diversity in our society."

history,"['2017-12', '2017-07-11']"
abstract,"Abstract People tend to match the behaviors and expressions of ingroup members or cooperative others more than outgroup members and competitors. We call this the group effect on interpersonal matching. Our review examines different types of groups to identify when different psychological factors may influence this group effect on matching. Specifically, research demonstrates that affiliation goals increase interpersonal matching; however, other factors such as attention and emotional reaction also appear important. We argue that which of these factors enhance the group effect varies depending on whether group categories are based on minimal, incidental, interdependent, or socially consequential differences. In addition, which expressions (e.g., smiles vs. frowns) are matched varies across group types. To facilitate more directed research, this review describes three key factors and provides a framework to consider which may be involved at different levels of groups. By examining different types of groups, a more complete understanding of how group differences increase or decrease interpersonal matching can be uncovered, providing additional insight into the factors influencing interpersonal matching."

abstract,"Abstract The study investigates effects of emotional pictures and words on Center of Pressure (CoP) whole-body reactions, based on theories of emotional valence and arousal, approach–avoidance theory, freezing in humans, and stimulus type (pictures vs. words). For freezing, the study differentiated between rambling and trembling components of the CoP reaction. We hypothesized that negative versus positive emotional valence caused stronger CoP avoidance, for both emotional pictures and words. In addition, freezing was hypothesized to be evident in the CoP trembling component caused by high emotional arousal. Forty-five students enrolled in a teacher program completed a bipedal assessment on a force plate while watching positive versus negative and high- versus low-arousal pictures and words that had been selected from stimulus lists in a pretest. Participants rated the valence and arousal of all stimuli in a questionnaire, the results of which indicated a relationship between negative valence and high arousal. The force plate data confirm the hypotheses. First, negative stimuli elicited significant avoidance CoP shifts, independent of their arousal, as indicated by t tests. This effect was found for both emotional pictures and words. CoP for positive stimuli did not differ from zero. Second, indicating freezing, the CoP trembling component was increased by high arousal, independent of valence. Freezing was only found for emotional pictures. The study discusses both the CoP avoidance effect with respect to valence and stimulus type, and the value of the trembling analysis for freezing. It closes with an analysis of the methodological limitations and with recommendations for future studies."

history,"['2017-12', '2017-04-24']"
abstract,"Abstract The present research investigated how temporal distance affects imitation of gestures during a conversation. According to construal level theory, psychological closeness (vs. distance) leads to preference for more pictorial and embodied (vs. symbolic and amodal) forms of communication as well as to greater context sensitivity. We thus hypothesized that people are more sensitive to the contextual meaning of gestures and show more imitation of meaningful (vs. meaningless) gestures when primed with temporal closeness (compared to distance). Participants (N = 91) were assigned to the role of a job interviewer for an internship that would begin in 1 week (vs. in 1 year) and interacted with an ostensible applicant who displayed various meaningful and meaningless gestures. When the internship was to start in 1 week, participants imitated meaningful gestures more often than meaningless gestures. When the internship was to start in 1 year, participants imitated both gesture types equally frequently. This finding indicates that people are more likely to embody verbal statements of an interaction partner when feeling psychologically close to the subject of the conversation."

abstract,"Abstract 
It is well recognized that chronic low back pain (cLBP) can be estimated from nonverbal pain behaviors. However, only a few studies examined how clinicians rely on those when estimating specific outcomes, such as pain intensity and pain disability. Therefore, the present study examines (1) if facial expressions and guarding behaviors (including speed of the movement and lifting strategy) contribute to the prediction of pain intensity and disability in patients with cLBP; and (2) if these pain behaviors have been given the same importance according to the outcome. Twenty-five experienced clinicians and thirty-one novice clinicians were asked to estimate low back pain intensity and disability from a realistic virtual character performing a lifting lowering task. The studied pain behaviors were manipulated across different conditions. Pain intensity and disability were judged higher when the character moved more slowly and displayed painful facial expression. Speed of the movement and facial expressions explained a greater portion of variance when related to pain intensity assessment than to pain disability assessment. Results  also showed a significant interaction between the lifting strategy, the speed of the movement and facial expressions, but only when estimating the character’s pain-related intensity. Novice clinicians rated pain disability higher than experienced clinicians did. Although pain-related concepts, pain intensity and related disability are not estimated through the same pain behaviors by clinicians. Clinical experience does not contribute to clinical judgments through the use of nonverbal pain behaviors when estimating pain outcomes but contributes to pain disability rating overall."

abstract,"Abstract Psychopathic individuals are characterized as “intra-species predators”—callous, impulsive, aggressive, and proficient at interpersonal manipulation. For example, despite their high risk for re-offending, psychopathic offenders often receive early release on parole. While reputed to be social chameleons, research suggests that even naive observers can accurately infer high levels of psychopathic traits in others with very brief exposures to behavior, but accuracy degrades with extended observation. We utilized a lens model approach to examine the communication styles (emotional facial expressions, body language, and verbal content) of offenders varying in levels of psychopathic traits using “thin slice” video clips of psychological assessment interviews and to reveal which cues observers use to inform their evaluations of psychopathy. Psychopathic traits were associated with more (a) Duchenne smiles, (b) negative (angry) emotional language, and (c) hand gestures (illustrators). Further, psychopathy was associated with a marked behavioral incongruence; when individuals scoring high in psychopathic traits engaged in Duchenne smiles they were also more likely to use angry language. Naïve observers relied on each of these valid behavioral signals to quickly and accurately detect psychopathic traits. These findings provide insight into psychopathic communication styles, opportunities for improving the detection of psychopathic personality traits, and may provide an avenue for understanding successful psychopathic manipulation."

abstract,"Abstract The perception of emotional facial expressions may activate corresponding facial muscles in the receiver, also referred to as facial mimicry. Facial mimicry is highly dependent on the context and type of facial expressions. While previous research almost exclusively investigated mimicry in response to pictures or videos of emotional expressions, studies with a real, face-to-face partner are still rare. Here we compared facial mimicry of angry, happy, and sad expressions and emotion recognition in a dyadic face-to-face setting. In sender-receiver dyads, we recorded facial electromyograms in parallel. Senders communicated to the receivers—with facial expressions only—the emotions felt during specific personal situations in the past, eliciting anger, happiness, or sadness. Receivers mostly mimicked happiness, to a lesser degree, sadness, and anger as the least mimicked emotion. In actor-partner interdependence models we showed that the receivers’ own facial activity influenced their ratings, which increased the agreement between the senders’ and receivers’ ratings for happiness, but not for angry and sad expressions. These results are in line with the Emotion Mimicry in Context View, holding that humans mimic happy expressions according to affiliative intentions. The mimicry of sad expressions is less intense, presumably because it signals empathy and might imply personal costs. Direct anger expressions are mimicked the least, possibly because anger communicates threat and aggression. Taken together, we show that incidental facial mimicry in a face-to-face setting is positively related to the recognition accuracy for non-stereotype happy expressions, supporting the functionality of facial mimicry."

abstract,"Abstract The present study aimed to clarify how listeners decode emotions from human nonverbal vocalizations, exploring unbiased recognition accuracy of vocal emotions selected from the Montreal Affective Voices (MAV) (Belin et al. in Trends Cognit Sci 8:129–135, 2008. doi: 10.1016/j.tics.2004.01.008). The MAV battery includes 90 nonverbal vocalizations expressing anger, disgust, fear, pain, sadness, surprise, happiness, sensual pleasure, as well as neutral expressions, uttered by female and male actors. Using a forced-choice recognition task, 156 native speakers of Portuguese were asked to identify the emotion category underlying each MAV sound, and additionally to rate the valence, arousal and dominance of these sounds. The analysis focused on unbiased hit rates (Hu Score; Wagner in J Nonverbal Behav 17(1):3–28, 1993. doi: 10.1007/BF00987006), as well as on the dimensional ratings for each discrete emotion. Further, we examined the relationship between categorical and dimensional ratings, as well as the effects of speaker’s and listener’s sex on these two types of assessment. Surprise vocalizations were associated with the poorest accuracy, whereas happy vocalizations were the most accurately recognized, contrary to previous studies. Happiness was associated with the highest valence and dominance ratings, whereas fear elicited the highest arousal ratings. Recognition accuracy and dimensional ratings of vocal expressions were dependent both on speaker’s sex and listener’s sex. Further, discrete vocal emotions were not consistently predicted by dimensional ratings. Using a large sample size, the present study provides, for the first time, unbiased recognition accuracy rates for a widely used battery of nonverbal vocalizations. The results demonstrated a dynamic interplay between listener’s and speaker’s variables (e.g., sex) in the recognition of emotion from nonverbal vocalizations. Further, they support the use of both categorical and dimensional accounts of emotion when probing how emotional meaning is decoded from nonverbal vocal cues."

history,"['2017-09', '2017-01-16']"
abstract,"Abstract Facial expressions related to sadness are a universal signal of nonverbal communication. Although results of many psychology studies have shown that drooping of the lip corners, raising of the chin, and oblique eyebrow movements (a combination of inner brow raising and brow lowering) express sadness, no report has described a study elucidating facial expression characteristics under well-controlled circumstances with people actually experiencing the emotion of sadness itself. Therefore, spontaneous facial expressions associated with sadness remain unclear. We conducted this study to accumulate important findings related to spontaneous facial expressions of sadness. We recorded the spontaneous facial expressions of a group of participants as they experienced sadness during an emotion-elicitation task. This task required a participant to recall neutral and sad memories while listening to music. We subsequently conducted a detailed analysis of their sad and neutral expressions using the Facial Action Coding System. The prototypical facial expressions of sadness in earlier studies were not observed when people experienced sadness as an internal state under non-social circumstances. By contrast, they expressed tension around the mouth, which might function as a form of suppression. Furthermore, results show that parts of these facial actions are not only related to sad experiences but also to other emotional experiences such as disgust, fear, anger, and happiness. This study revealed the possibility that new facial expressions contribute to the experience of sadness as an internal state."

abstract,"Abstract Fearful faces both capture our attention and hold it. However, little is known about the time-course for the capture and hold of spatial attention by fearful, and other emotional, faces. In three dot-probe studies we examined this time-course. Experiments 1 and 2 used fearful and neutral faces. In Experiment 1, dot-probe targets occurred 133, 266, and 532 ms post-face onset and in Experiment 2, dot-probe targets occurred 84, 168, 336, and 672 ms post-face onset. In Experiment 1, for both 133 and 266 ms conditions, reaction times were fastest for congruent trials and slowest for incongruent trials with reaction times for baseline trials falling between the two. The same pattern was found for the 84 and 168 ms conditions in Experiment 2. For the later time-points in both experiments there were no significant differences between conditions. To examine whether this time-course is unique to fearful faces, a third dot-probe experiment using time-points identical to Experiment 2 was conducted with happy and neutral faces. The results from Experiment 3 suggest that happy faces captured and held attention in the 168 and 336 ms conditions. Together, the results indicate that attention is captured and held by fearful faces at times earlier than approximately 300 ms, while happy faces also captured and held attention, but on a slightly different time-course from 168 to 336 ms."

abstract,"Abstract Despite known differences in the acoustic properties of children’s and adults’ voices, no work to date has examined the vocal cues associated with emotional prosody in youth. The current study investigated whether child (n = 24, 17 female, aged 9–15) and adult (n = 30, 15 female, aged 18–63) actors differed in the vocal cues underlying their portrayals of basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness) and social expressions (meanness, friendliness). We also compared the acoustic characteristics of meanness and friendliness to comparable basic emotions. The pattern of distinctions between expressions varied as a function of age for voice quality and mean pitch. Specifically, adults’ portrayals of the various expressions were more distinct in mean pitch than children’s, whereas children’s representations differed more in voice quality than adults’. Given the importance of pitch variables for the interpretation of a speaker’s intended emotion, expressions generated by adults may thus be easier for listeners to decode than those of children. Moreover, the vocal cues associated with the social expressions of meanness and friendliness were distinct from those of basic emotions like anger and happiness respectively. Overall, our findings highlight marked differences in the ways in which adults and children convey socio-emotional expressions vocally, and expand our understanding of the communication of paralanguage in social contexts. Implications for the literature on emotion recognition are discussed."

history,"['2017-06', '2017-01-03']"
abstract,"Abstract Interpersonal accuracy correlates modestly across different domains. Although some research has explored factors that predict accuracy within specific domains of interpersonal judgment (e.g., social attributes), whether any variables might predict interpersonal accuracy generally across different domains remains in question. Subjective socioeconomic status (SES) has recently emerged as an important moderator of various social cognitions, such as contextual focus and empathic accuracy. Moreover, people lower in SES tend to show greater interpersonal engagement and attention; thus, we wondered whether individuals with lower subjective SES might exhibit superior interpersonal accuracy in multiple domains. Indeed, across four studies, we found that subjective SES inversely correlated with accuracy in three different domains of interpersonal accuracy: social attributes, situational affect, and emotion. These findings therefore demonstrate that subjective SES may predict broad interpersonal accuracy abilities and suggest that, despite modest relationships between different types of first impression accuracy, the correlates of such accuracy can still operate across domains."

abstract,"Abstract Research into individual differences in interpersonal accuracy (IPA; the ability to accurately judge others’ emotions, intentions, traits, truthfulness, and other social characteristics) has a long tradition and represents a growing area of interest in psychology. Measuring IPA has proved fruitful for uncovering correlates of this skill. However, despite this tradition and a considerable volume of research, very few efforts have been made to look collectively at the nature of the tests involved in assessing IPA, leaving questions of the broader structure of IPA unresolved. Is IPA a single skill or a clustering of many discrete skills or some combination of partially overlapping skills? In a multi-level meta-analysis of 103 published and unpublished participant samples (13,683 participants), we analyzed 622 correlations between pairs of IPA tests (135 different IPA tests altogether). The overall correlation between IPA tests was r = .19, corrected for the nesting of correlations within the studies that administered more than two IPA tests and reported several correlations for the same participant sample. Test domain and characteristics were evaluated to explain differences in effect sizes; in general, tests in similar domains and using similar methodologies were more highly correlated with each other, suggesting that there are domains within which individual differences cluster. Implications for future research and IPA measurement were discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Human social interaction is enriched with synchronous movement which is said to be essential to establish interactional flow. One commonly investigated phenomenon in this regard is facial mimicry, the tendency of humans to mirror facial expressions. Because studies investigating facial mimicry in face-to-face interactions are lacking, the temporal dynamics of facial mimicry remain unclear. We therefore developed and tested the suitability of a novel approach to quantifying facial expression synchrony in face-to-face interactions: windowed cross-lagged correlation analysis (WCLC) for electromyography signals. We recorded muscle activations related to smiling (Zygomaticus Major) and frowning (Corrugator Supercilii) of two interaction partners simultaneously in 30 dyadic affiliative interactions. We expected WCLC to reliably detect facial expression synchrony above chance level and, based on previous research, expected the occurrence of rapid synchronization of smiles within 200 ms. WCLC significantly detected synchrony of smiling but not frowning compared to a control condition of chance level synchrony in six different interactional phases (smiling: d  z  s = .85–1.11; frowning: d  z  s = .01–.30). Synchronizations of smiles between interaction partners predominantly occurred within 1000 ms, with a significant amount occurring within 200 ms. This rapid synchronization of smiles supports the notion of the existence of an anticipated mimicry response for smiles. We conclude that WCLC is suited to quantify the temporal dynamics of facial expression synchrony in dyadic interactions and discuss implications for different psychological research areas."

abstract,"Abstract Behavioral observation techniques which relate action to personality have long been neglected (Furr and Funder in Handbook of research methods in personality psychology, The Guilford Press, New York, 2007) and, when employed, often use human judges to code behavior. In the current study we used an alternative to human coding (biomechanical research techniques) to investigate how personality traits are manifest in gait. We used motion capture technology to record 29 participants walking on a treadmill at their natural speed. We analyzed their thorax and pelvis movements, as well as speed of gait. Participants completed personality questionnaires, including a Big Five measure and a trait aggression questionnaire. We found that gait related to several of our personality measures. The magnitude of upper body movement, lower body movement, and walking speed, were related to Big Five personality traits and aggression. Here, we present evidence that some gait measures can relate to Big Five and aggressive personalities. We know of no other examples of research where gait has been shown to correlate with self-reported measures of personality and suggest that more research should be conducted between largely automatic movement and personality."

abstract,"Abstract We examined the effects of social and cultural contexts on smiles displayed by children during gameplay. Eight-year-old Dutch and Chinese children either played a game alone or teamed up to play in pairs. Activation and intensity of facial muscles corresponding to Action Unit (AU) 6 and AU 12 were coded according to Facial Action Coding System. Co-occurrence of activation of AU 6 and AU 12, suggesting the presence of a Duchenne smile, was more frequent among children who teamed up than among children who played alone. Analyses of the intensity of smiles revealed an interaction between social and cultural contexts. Whereas smiles, both Duchenne and non-Duchenne, displayed by Chinese children who teamed up were more intense than those displayed by Chinese children who played alone, the effect of sociality on smile intensity was not observed for Dutch children. These findings suggest that the production of smiles by children in a competitive context is susceptible to both social and cultural factors."

abstract,"Abstract Laughter is a common social behavior. Yet when, why, and how laughter may cause positive relationship change is largely unexamined, empirically. The current studies focus on shared laughter (i.e., when), drawing from theory in relationship science to emphasize the importance of conceptualizing laughter as situated within the dyadic context (i.e., why). Specifically, these studies target untested possible short-term outcomes from social interactions involving shared laughter: positive emotions, negative emotions, and perceived similarity. In turn, each are tested as possible mechanisms through which shared laughter promotes more global relationship well-being (i.e., how). A series of online and laboratory studies provide correlational and causal support for the hypothesis that shared laughter promotes relationship well-being, with increased perceptions of similarity most consistently driving this effect. Discussion focuses on the importance of considering the behavior of laughter itself, as situated within the social context, when making predictions about laughter’s relevance for social life."

abstract,"Abstract Self-report studies have found evidence that cultures differ in the display rules they have for facial expressions (i.e., for what is appropriate for different people at different times). However, observational studies of actual patterns of facial behavior have been rare and typically limited to the analysis of dozens of participants from two or three regions. We present the first large-scale evidence of cultural differences in observed facial behavior, including 740,984 participants from 12 countries around the world. We used an Internet-based framework to collect video data of participants in two different settings: in their homes and in market research facilities. Using computer vision algorithms designed for this dataset, we measured smiling and brow furrowing expressions as participants watched television ads. Our results reveal novel findings and provide empirical evidence to support theories about cultural and gender differences in display rules. Participants from more individualist cultures displayed more brow furrowing overall, whereas smiling depended on both culture and setting. Specifically, participants from more individualist countries were more expressive in the facility setting, while participants from more collectivist countries were more expressive in the home setting. Female participants displayed more smiling and less brow furrowing than male participants overall, with the latter difference being more pronounced in more individualist countries. This is the first study to leverage advances in computer science to enable large-scale observational research that would not have been possible using traditional methods."

Right-handed participants (N = 81) were asked to pose for a photograph and then play the trust game. Participants showed an overall left posing bias (i.e., showing their left cheek to the camera). The left cheek bias was more stable for participants that cooperated very little in the trust game (non-cooperators) than for those that cooperated a lot (cooperators). In the rating experiment (N = 28 and 25), non-cooperators showing their left cheek were rated equally as trustworthy as cooperators. On the other hand, non-cooperators who showed their right cheek were rated as less trustworthy than cooperators. These results suggest that non-cooperators intuitively use the left hemiface to exploit others in social interactions."

history,"['2016-12', '2016-04-21']"
abstract,"Abstract People can reliably distinguish the sex of faces across age groups. Rates of accuracy are lower for infants, however, likely because they lack the pronounced sexually dimorphic features that develop during puberty. Given that previous research has shown that perceivers categorize adult sex automatically, we wondered whether this would extend to the faces of infants for whom sex is less legible. We tested this using a semantic priming paradigm in which infant faces preceded the categorization of stereotypically male and female names. Results  showed that participants categorized the sex of male names significantly faster following perceptions of male versus female infant faces (though female faces did not significantly facilitate the processing of female names). The asymmetry in interference for male but not female faces supports evidence for a male default in conceptions of sex among infants previously found for adults. Individuals may therefore process sex automatically in the absence of overt cues (e.g., post-pubertal sexually dimorphic features or stereotypical clothing), providing additional evidence for the depth and flexibility of social categorization."

abstract,"Abstract Although appearance-based cues can help to diagnose physical illness, visual manifestations of mental disorder may be more elusive. Here, we investigated whether individuals could distinguish women with a serious mental disorder (borderline personality disorder) from demographically- and IQ-matched non-psychiatric controls. Participants rated mentally ill targets as more likely to have a mental disorder from photos more accurately than chance, despite not believing that such judgments were possible. The configuration of facial cues played an important role in these judgments, as interfering with the spatial relationships between facial features reduced participants’ accuracy to chance guessing. Further investigation showed similar results when participants rated the targets for specific mental disorders (borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder) and rated the mentally ill targets as more depressed, angry, anxious, disgusted, emotionally unstable, distressed, and less happy. Moreover, the depression ratings significantly correlated with the targets’ actual depressive symptoms. Thus, individuals may be able to infer aspects of mental disorder from minimal facial cues."

Positive touch was examined during a play-related storytelling task and a reminiscence task (conversation about past emotions). Fathers touched their children positively more frequently during the play-related storytelling task than did mothers. Both mothers and fathers were in closer proximity to their 6-year-olds than their 4-year-olds. Mothers and fathers touched their children positively more frequently when reminiscing than when playing. Finally, 6-year-olds remained closer to their parents than did 4-year-olds. Implications of these findings for future research on children’s socioemotional development are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that teachers’ gestures are beneficial for student learning. In this research, we investigate whether teachers’ gestures have comparable effects in face-to-face live instruction and video-based instruction. We provided sixty-three 7–10 year old students with instruction about mathematical equivalence problems (e.g., 3 + 4 + 5 = __ + 5). Students were assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 × 2 factorial design that varied (1) instruction medium (video vs. live), and (2) instruction modality (speech vs. speech + gesture). There was no main effect of medium: The same amount of learning occurred whether instruction was done live or on video. There was a main effect of modality: Speech instruction accompanied by gesture resulted in significantly more learning and transfer than instruction conveyed through speech only. Gesture’s effect on instruction was stronger for video instruction than live instruction. These findings suggest that there may be a limit to gesture’s role in communication that results in student learning."

abstract,"Abstract Interpersonal coordination, the extent to which social partners coordinate each other’s postures and mannerisms, acts as a “social glue” that serves both individual and social goals, such as producing prosocial behaviors and facilitating harmonious interactions. Research in this area has become prominent in a variety of domains both within and outside of psychology, forming a sizeable literature dedicated to investigating the causes and consequences of interpersonal coordination. We conducted a series of meta-analyses on studies that treated interpersonal coordination as an independent variable, in order to measure its effect on several intrapersonal (e.g., mood, need to belong) and interpersonal (e.g., prosocial behavior) outcomes, as well as several potential moderators (e.g., percentage of female participants) that may affect the strength of the effect. Overall, the results demonstrated that the positive effects of interpersonal coordination are robust, with a few exceptions specific to intrapersonal outcomes. These findings provide a much-needed quantitative summary of the literature on interpersonal coordination, and highlight areas that merit future research."

history,"['2016-12', '2016-04-16']"
abstract,"Abstract We investigated how power priming affects facial emotion recognition in the context of body postures conveying the same or different emotion. Facial emotions are usually recognized better when the face is presented with a congruent body posture, and recognized worse when the body posture is incongruent. In our study, we primed participants to either low, high, or neutral power prior to their performance in a facial-emotion categorization task in which faces were presented together with a congruent or incongruent body posture. Facial emotion recognition in high-power participants was not affected by body posture. In contrast, low-power and neutral-power participants were significantly affected by the congruence of facial and body emotions. Specifically, these participants displayed better facial emotion recognition when the body posture was congruent, and worse performance when the body posture was incongruent. In a following task, we trained the same participants to categorize two sets of novel checkerboard stimuli and then engaged them in a recognition test involving compounds of these stimuli. High, low, and neutral-power participants all showed a strong congruence effect for compound checkerboard stimuli. We discuss our results with reference to the literature on power and social perception."

abstract,"Abstract Social touch is essential for physical and emotional well-being. However, different meanings can be attributed to physical contact during social interactions and may generate bonding or avoidant behaviors. This personal and unique experience is not usually taken into account in health and social care services. The aim of this study is to produce a valid and reliable European Portuguese version of the Social Touch Questionnaire (STQ, Wilhelm et al. in Biol Psychol 58:181–202, 2001. doi: 10.1016/S0301-0511(01)00113-2). The STQ is a self-report questionnaire for adolescents and adults measuring behaviors and attitudes towards social touch. The original version was translated into European Portuguese using a forward-back translation process and its feasibility was examined. To evaluate the psychometric properties, a total of 242 Portuguese university students participated in the study (21.3 ± 3.8 years). The STQ was considered feasible, showed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .734), and the test–retest correlation with the STQ items demonstrated a high concordance between the tests over a two-week interval (ICC = .990; n = 50). Validity tests were performed, comparing the total score of the STQ with that of the anxiety and avoidance subscales of the Social Interaction and Performance Anxiety and Avoidance Scale (SIPAAS). A very significant conceptual convergence was confirmed between the STQ and with the SIPAAS-Anxiety (r = .64; p < .0001) and with the SIPAAS-Avoidance (r = .59; p < .0001). The exploratory factor analysis, with Promax rotation, revealed 3 factors: dislike of physical touch, liking of familiar physical touch and liking of public physical touch (Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .68 to .75). Psychometric properties confirmed the adaptation of the STQ to the Portuguese culture. It is a reliable and valid self-report questionnaire and it appears to be a useful tool to assess behaviors and attitudes towards social touch."

abstract,"Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated that judgments of business leaders’ faces predict their organizations’ financial performance. To date, these predictions have been derived exclusively from the impressions of naïve perceivers. Here, we tested how perceivers’ knowledge and experience in business might relate to their judgments of CEOs’ leadership ability from nonverbal facial cues. In Study 1, business students performed similarly to non-business students when rating faces for leadership ability. Business professionals with many years of experience exhibited significantly lower accuracy than professionals without business experience in Study 2, however. Following previous research demonstrating that experience in a particular domain can ironically reduce the accuracy of individuals’ judgments, our findings suggest that perceivers’ experience in executive business management positions may inhibit them from accurately judging leadership ability from nonverbal information. Domain-specific knowledge may therefore impair the accuracy of first impressions."

abstract,"Abstract The capacity to engage with one’s child in a reciprocally responsive way is an important element of successful and rewarding parent–child conversations, which are common contexts for emotion socialization. The degree to which a parent–child dyad shows a mutually responsive orientation presumably depends on both individuals’ socio-emotional skills. For example, one or both members of a dyad needs to be able to accurately interpret and respond to the other’s nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, to facilitate mutually responsive interactions. Little research, however, has examined whether and how mother and/or child facial expression decoding skill relates to dyads’ emotional mutuality during conversations. We thus examined associations between both mother and child facial expression decoding skill and observed emotional mutuality during parent-preschooler conversations about happy child memories. Results  lend support to our hypotheses by suggesting that both mother and child capacities to read others’ emotional cues make distinct contributions to parent–child emotional mutuality in the context of reminiscing conversations. Specifically, mothers’ accurate decoding of child facial expressions predicted maternal displays of positive affect and interest, while children’s accurate decoding of adult facial expressions predicted dyadic displays of mutual enjoyment. Contrary to our hypotheses, however, parent/child facial expression decoding skills did not interact to predict observed mutual responsiveness. These findings underscore the importance of attending to both parent and child contributions to successful dyadic interactions that facilitate effective emotion socialization."

abstract,"Abstract Emerging evidence revealed that honesty and trustworthiness are important drivers of the impression-formation process. Questions remain, however, regarding the role of these moral attributes in guiding real and concrete behaviors. Filling this gap, the present study investigated the influence of honesty on a nonverbal behavior that regulates social interactions: behavioral synchrony. Movements were recorded while participants interacted with a partner who was depicted as honest (versus dishonest) or as friendly (versus unfriendly). Results  showed that synchrony was affected only by the honesty of the partner. Specifically, the more the interaction partner lacked honesty, the lower the perceived similarity between the self and the interaction partner, which in turn diminished the promptness to engage in behavioral synchrony. Our findings connected the literature on behavioral synchrony with that on the implication of morality for social perception, revealing the key role of the honesty facet of moral character in shaping nonverbal behaviors."

All age groups used the Pleasure Scale reliably and accurately with all three types of stimuli. All used the Arousal Scale with stylized faces and with facial expressions, but only 5-year-olds did so for emotion labels."

abstract,"Abstract Accurate pain assessment is a joint function of both the judge perceiving correct (valid) cues of pain and targets displaying valid indicators of pain. The present research examined whether the judgeability of pain expressions could be altered by manipulating the nonverbal supportiveness of a videotaped physician who guided targets through an experimentally induced pain experience in the laboratory. Ten-s video clips of these targets during their pain experience were viewed by 95 naïve judges who assessed each target’s pain on an 11-point numeric rating scale. In addition, the video clips were rated by independent coders on 9-point scales (focused, calm, tense, distressed, composed, fidgety, determined, bored, and nervous). Judges’ pain assessment accuracy was calculated by correlating their inferred pain rating for each target with targets’ self-reported pain. Pain targets assigned to interact with the nonverbally supportive physician displayed more valid impressions of their pain and judges had higher pain assessment accuracy when viewing these targets compared to targets assigned to interact with the nonverbally unsupportive physician. Interventions for caregivers and healthcare providers that emphasize the importance of nonverbal behavior when interacting with pain sufferers are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Smiling individuals are usually perceived more favorably than non-smiling ones—they are judged as happier, more attractive, competent, and friendly. These seemingly clear and obvious consequences of smiling are assumed to be culturally universal, however most of the psychological research is carried out in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) and the influence of culture on social perception of nonverbal behavior is still understudied. Here we show that a smiling individual may be judged as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual in cultures low on the GLOBE’s uncertainty avoidance dimension. Furthermore, we show that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smiling—in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced. This research fosters understanding of the cultural framework surrounding nonverbal communication processes and reveals that in some cultures smiling may lead to negative attributions."

abstract,"Abstract The human body plays a central role in nonverbal communication, conveying attitudes, personality, and values during social interactions. Three experiments in a large, open classroom setting investigated whether the visibility of torso-located cues affects nonverbal communication of similarity. In Experiments 1 and 2, half the participants wore a black plastic bag over their torso. Participants interacted with an unacquainted same-sex individual selected from a large class who was also wearing (or also not wearing) a bag. Experiment 3 added a clear bag condition, in which visual torso cues were not obscured. Across experiments, black bag-wearing participants selected partners who were less similar to them on attitudes, behaviors, and personality compared to the bag-less—and clear bag—participants. Nonverbal cues in the torso communicate information about similarity of attitudes, behavior, and personality; the center of the body plays a surprisingly central role in early-stage person perception and attraction."

abstract,"Abstract Gender roles in mainstream US culture suggest that girls express more happiness, sadness, anxiety, and shame/embarrassment than boys, while boys express more anger and externalizing emotions, such as contempt. However, gender roles and emotion expression may be different in low-income and ethnically diverse families, as children and parents are often faced with greater environmental stressors and may have different gender expectations. This study examined gender differences in emotion expression in low-income adolescents, an understudied population. One hundred and seventy nine adolescents (aged 14–17) participated in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Trained coders rated adolescents’ expressions of happiness, sadness, anxiety, shame/embarrassment, anger, and contempt during the TSST using a micro-analytic coding system. Analyses showed that, consistent with gender roles, girls expressed higher levels of happiness and shame than boys; however, contrary to traditional gender roles, girls showed higher levels of contempt than boys. Also, in contrast to cultural stereotypes, there were no differences in anger between boys and girls. Findings suggest gender-role inconsistent displays of externalizing emotions in low-income adolescents under acute stress, and may reflect different emotion socialization experiences in this group."

abstract,"Abstract  Several authors have recently presented evidence for perceptual and neural distinctions between genuine and acted expressions of emotion. Here, we describe how differences in authenticity affect the acoustic and perceptual properties of laughter. In an acoustic analysis, we contrasted spontaneous, authentic laughter with volitional, fake laughter, finding that spontaneous laughter was higher in pitch, longer in duration, and had different spectral characteristics from volitional laughter that was produced under full voluntary control. In a behavioral experiment, listeners perceived spontaneous and volitional laughter as distinct in arousal, valence, and authenticity. Multiple regression analyses further revealed that acoustic measures could significantly predict these affective and authenticity judgements, with the notable exception of authenticity ratings for spontaneous laughter. The combination of acoustic predictors differed according to the laughter type, where volitional laughter ratings were uniquely predicted by harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). To better understand the role of HNR in terms of the physiological effects on vocal tract configuration as a function of authenticity during laughter production, we ran an additional experiment in which phonetically trained listeners rated each laugh for breathiness, nasality, and mouth opening. Volitional laughter was found to be significantly more nasal than spontaneous laughter, and the item-wise physiological ratings also significantly predicted affective judgements obtained in the first experiment. Our findings suggest that as an alternative to traditional acoustic measures, ratings of phonatory and articulatory features can be useful descriptors of the acoustic qualities of nonverbal emotional vocalizations, and of their perceptual implications."

history,"['2016-06', '2015-12-19']"
abstract,"Abstract Humans can detect whether athletes are leading or trailing based on thin slices of athletes’ nonverbal behavior, presumably because communicating and interpreting status has evolved to be highly beneficial for humans. The goal of the present research was to examine this evolutionary perspective on nonverbal behavior in sports. First, in Experiment 1 (N = 40), we investigated if leading athletes are rated higher on dimensions related to social status than are trailing athletes. Experiment 1 showed that perceivers rated leading athletes as more dominant, more proud, and more confident than trailing athletes, without being aware of the actual score. Second, we were interested in the role of head-related versus body-related information and in the role of dynamic versus static information. In Experiment 2, 120 participants watched short videos from basketball matches and rated whether athletes were leading or trailing. We occluded either athletes’ faces, athletes’ bodies, or showed both faces and bodies. Experiments 2 and 3 (N = 160) showed that very scarce information was sufficient for differentiating between leading and trailing athletes, even when faces or bodies were occluded. These findings are in line with ecological approaches to person perception and evolutionary accounts of nonverbal behavior."

The purpose of the present study was to test whether the ability to recognize facial expressions of negative emotions predicted greater relationship satisfaction with their romantic relationships and whether this link was mediated by constructive responses to conflict. Participants currently involved in a romantic relationship completed a validated performance measure of recognition of facial expressions and afterwards reported on the responses they engaged in during conflict with their romantic partner and rated their romantic relationship satisfaction. Results  showed that accurate recognition of facial expressions of negative emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and sadness) predicted less conflict engaging behaviors during conflict with their romantic partners (but not positive problem solving and withdrawal), which in turn predicted greater relationship satisfaction. The present study is the first to show that the ability to recognize facial expressions of negative emotions is related to romantic relationship satisfaction and that constructive responses to conflict such as less conflict engaging behaviors, mediate this process."

abstract,"Abstract We assessed the impact of social context on the judgment of emotional facial expressions as a function of self-construal and decoding rules. German and Greek participants rated spontaneous emotional faces shown either alone or surrounded by other faces with congruent or incongruent facial expressions. Greek participants were higher in interdependence than German participants. In line with cultural decoding rules, Greek participants rated anger expressions less intensely and sad and disgust expressions more intensely. Social context affected the ratings by both groups in different ways. In the more interdependent culture (Greece) participants perceived anger least intensely when the group showed neutral expressions, whereas sadness expressions were rated as most intense in the absence of social context. In the independent culture (Germany) a group context (others expressing anger or happiness) additionally amplified the perception of angry and happy expressions. In line with the notion that these effects are mediated by more holistic processing linked to higher interdependence, this difference disappeared when we controlled for interdependence on the individual level. The findings confirm the usefulness of considering both country level and individual level factors when studying cultural differences."

abstract,"Abstract Generic noun phrases, or generics, refer to kinds (e.g., Birds lay eggs) rather than specific individuals (e.g., This bird lays eggs). Prior research with adults has indicated that adults are less likely to gesture in association with generic versus specific reference. In the current studies, we examined this phenomenon in children, comparing children’s gestures in scenarios of generic versus specific reference. Across two pragmatic contexts, three- to six-year-old children’s pointing was reduced during generic reference compared to specific reference. Results  thus suggest that the tendency to reduce gestural marking for generics emerges early in development. We discuss these results within the context of a claim known as the “generics-as-default” proposal, which holds that reduced marking reflects that generics are basic and cognitively default."

The intervention was a modification of a commercially-available, computerized, dynamic facial emotion training tool, the MiX by Humintell©. Modifications were introduced to address the special learning needs of individuals with ASD and to address limitations in current emotion recognition programs. Modifications included: coach-assistance, a combination of didactic instruction for seven basic emotions, scaffold instruction which included repeated practice with increased presentation speeds, guided attention to relevant facial cues, and imitation of expressions. Training occurred twice each week for 45–60 min across an average of six sessions. Outcome measures were administered prior to and immediately after treatment, as well as after a delay period of 4–6 weeks. Outcome measures included (a) direct assessment of facial emotion recognition, (b) emotion self-expression, and (c) generalization through emotion awareness in videos and stories, use of emotion words, and self-, parent-, and teacher-report on social functioning questionnaires. The facial emotion training program enabled children and adolescents with ASD to more accurately and quickly identify feelings in facial expressions with stimuli from both the training tool and generalization measures and demonstrate improved self-expression of facial emotion."

abstract,"Abstract 
Emotional intelligence (EI) can be defined as the ability to understand, perceive, and manage emotions. However, there is little research investigating how EI influences decision-making during emotionally difficult situations. We hypothesized that higher EI would correlate with greater utilization of socially relevant facial cues during emotional decision-making. Sixty-two 18–45 year olds completed a decision-making task simulating an airport security screening during a credible terrorist threat. Participants viewed a series of facial photographs of potential passengers (white men and women) and selected which passengers to detain for further interrogation. The face photographs were previously rated for a set of character traits (e.g., aggression) by independent judges. Participants completed measures of trait (self-perceived) and ability (performance-based) EI and cognitive intelligence (IQ). With higher ability EI, participants were more likely to detain only individuals judged to be particularly high in negative traits (e.g., “aggression”) and especially low in positive traits (e.g., “trustworthy”), suggesting greater acuity in decision choices. These associations were driven primarily by the facilitating and understanding branches of EI (i.e., the ability to generate and use emotion to facilitate decision making, and the ability to understand factors that generate and modify emotions). No association between trait EI or IQ and detainment decisions was found. Findings suggest that individuals with higher ability EI were more likely to utilize the available but limited social information (i.e., facial features) when completing an emotional decision-making task than those with lower EI. These findings have implications for real-life situations involving similarly difficult emotional decision-making processes."

abstract,"Abstract 
Faces and voices, in isolation, prompt consistent social evaluations. However, most human interactions involve both seeing and talking with another person. Our main goal was to investigate how facial and vocal information are combined to reach an integrated person impression. In Study 1, we asked participants to rate faces and voices separately for perceived trustworthiness, attractiveness, and dominance. Most previous studies relied on stimuli in which extra-vocal information (e.g., verbal content, prosody) may have confounded voice-based effects; to prevent these unwanted influences, we used brief, neutral vowel sounds. Voices, like faces, led to the formation of highly reliable impressions. Voice trustworthiness correlated with voice attractiveness, mirroring the relation between face trustworthiness and attractiveness, but did not correlate with voice dominance. Inconsistent with the possibility that face and voice evaluations are indicative of real character traits, we found no positive correlations between judgments of trustworthiness or dominance based on faces and the same judgments based on voices (there was also no correlation between face attractiveness and voice attractiveness). In Study 2, we asked participants to evaluate male targets after seeing their faces and hearing their voices. Faces and voices contributed equally to judgments of trustworthiness and combined to produce a significant interaction effect. For attractiveness, faces were given more weight than voices, possibly due to the predominantly visual character of the attractiveness concept (there was no interaction effect). For dominance, the reverse pattern was true, with voices having a larger effect than faces on final judgments. In this case the auditory cues may be perceived to be more reliable because of the strong links between voice pitch, masculinity, and dominance."

abstract,"Abstract It is well established that gestures and speech form an integrated system of communication; gestures that match the meaning of the speech they accompany favor the listener’s discourse comprehension, whereas mismatching gestures whose meaning conveys information contradicting that conveyed by speech, impair comprehension. A less investigated issue is whether or not the uptake of gestural information is a deterministic process. In line with recent studies in the literature, we purport that the process may be modulated by certain factors. In particular, we investigate the role of unrelated gestures whose meaning, which is irrelevant to the speech they accompany, could be neglected. The results of four experiments led us to conclude that unrelated gestures are not processed, and that the uptake of gestural information is a non-deterministic process."

abstract,"Abstract The present study examined whether the grade point averages (GPAs) of university students could be predicted from appearance-based ratings of their Conscientiousness. Undergraduate participants (N = 249) provided self-reports of their Big Five personality traits and copies of their student transcripts from which their GPAs were obtained. Photographs of these undergraduates were then taken from which their personality traits were judged by unacquainted perceivers. Both aggregated and single perceiver-ratings of Conscientiousness predicted GPA. Aggregated perceiver-ratings predicted GPA incrementally over self-ratings, suggesting that appearance-based judgements of Conscientiousness may contain trait-relevant information beyond the scope of self-reports. These results contribute to a growing literature documenting the validity of appearance-based judgements of personality traits."

history,"['2015-12', '2015-04-17']"
abstract,"Abstract Power hierarchies in interaction are maintained due to a variety of cues, including gender and body language, and can keep competent individuals from being regarded as high status. The present study primed participants with an image consisting of two components—gender (man or woman) and body pose (dominant or submissive)—and then asked participants to classify written target words as either dominant or submissive. In response to these target words, we measured accuracy (% incorrect) and classification speed (RT), in addition to event-related potentials (ERPs), from 23 participants. Although we did not find ERP differences in the predicted N400 component, error rate and RT measures indicated that regardless of the gender of the prime, dominant poses facilitated identification of dominant words. Interestingly, whereas female submissive posing facilitated classification of submissive target words, male submissive posing did not. These results support the idea that women can use counter-stereotypical nonverbal displays, dominant poses, to change how they are initially perceived in terms of power. Interestingly, men may be more limited in the success of their counter-stereotypical, submissive, posing. Potential underlying mechanisms are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract 
Facial behavior can be seen as one part of more general behavior to create specific relationship patterns by communicating distinct affective information. Previous results on disorder-specific facial affective behavior are mixed: thus, a disorder-related specificity of facial affective expression has been called into question. We examined the facial affective behavior of patients attending a clinical interview that focused on different and often difficult aspects of life. Facial affective behavior was coded with FACS in 90 female subjects: 74 patients with different mental disorders and 16 healthy controls. Differences in facial affective behavior (according to EmFACS) between diagnostic groups (those with borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, and healthy controls) were calculated. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to detect subgroups of facial affective patterns, and the clusters were linked to disorder groups. Frequencies of facial affective behavior were correlated with clinical severity scores. No significant differences in facial affective behavior between diagnostic groups were found. Furthermore, no group-specific facial lead affect was found in this sample: all groups showed disgust as the most frequent expression. Additionally, frequency of facial affective behavior was not substantially related to clinical severity variables. Clusters of facial affective behavior could be extracted but were neither related to diagnostic groups nor to clinical severity scores. Our results fail to find evidence for disorder-specific facial affective behavior. Possible reasons for our results, such as the problem-focused clinical interview, high comorbidity, the non-dyadic analysis, and the insufficiency of analyzing pure frequencies, are discussed."

We investigated the robustness of the gestural misinformation effect, examining the extent to which an interviewer’s gestures mislead children under conditions that would normally buffer them against verbal suggestibility (strength of memory trace, age, and verbal ability). Children (a younger sample aged 2–4 years, n = 30; and an older sample aged 7–9 years, n = 26) were exposed to a videotaped event and questioned immediately, having been allocated randomly to either an accurate gesture condition (gestures consistent with observed events, e.g., “What was the lady wearing?” plus a ‘hat’ gesture) or a misleading gesture condition (“What was the lady wearing?” plus a ‘gloves’ gesture). Children were susceptible to the gestural misinformation effect even when questioned immediately after witnessing the event, regardless of age and verbal ability. These findings reveal new insights into the robustness of the gestural misinformation effect in children’s eyewitness interviews."

history,"['2015-09', '2015-02-12']"
abstract,"Abstract Visibility of speakers’ conversational hand gestures has been shown to facilitate listeners’ comprehension. Is this true for all types of gestures? In Experiment 1, speakers were videotaped describing apartment layouts from memory. When describing complex compared to simple layouts, speakers used more representational gestures. In particular, they used more iconic–deictic gestures, or hand movements that represent both an object or action, and direction or location. This suggests that the frequency of complex representational gestures increases as a function of task difficulty. To assess the extent to which these gestures facilitate speech comprehension, in Experiment 2 a new group of participants either watched the videos of the apartment descriptions (audio + video condition) or only heard the descriptions (audio-only condition) and drew each corresponding layout. Although drawing accuracy did not differ as a function of condition, the more iconic–deictic gestures produced during the apartment descriptions, the less accurate listeners’ drawings were. Together, findings from Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that iconic–deictic gestures reflect task difficulty for the speaker and do not necessarily facilitate comprehension for the listener."

history,"['2015-09', '2015-04-01']"
abstract,"Abstract 
Recent studies have documented that metacognitive processes underlying social perception contribute to interpersonal prejudice. For example, individuals categorized as lesbian/gay on the basis of their physical appearance are processed disfluently, and such disfluent processing arouses negative social evaluations. Although this pattern of results has replicated across several independent samples, evidence for the social consequences of perceptual disfluency remains limited to a handful of stigmatized groups. Here, we tested disfluency’s effects among a social group that has received scant attention in research on social perception—namely, bisexual individuals. We found that (a) perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy categorizing targets as bisexual versus not bisexual based upon facial photographs, (b) gender-atypical facial features were associated with bisexual categorizations, (c) targets who were categorized as bisexual and targets who personally identified as bisexual were evaluated more negatively than those who were not categorized/identified as bisexual, and (d) disfluent processing of nonverbal cues—especially gendered cues—helped to explain anti-bisexual prejudice. Collectively, these findings contribute to the growing literature on perceptions of sexual orientation and highlight the generalizability of perceptual fluency for understanding diverse forms of prejudice that arise in the early moments of social perception."

abstract,"Abstract 
The present studies examined how sensitivity to spatiotemporal percepts such as rhythm, angularity, configuration, and force predicts accuracy in perceiving emotion. In Study 1, participants (N = 99) completed a nonverbal test battery consisting of three nonverbal emotion perception tests and two perceptual sensitivity tasks assessing rhythm sensitivity and angularity sensitivity. Study 2 (N = 101) extended the findings of Study 1 with the addition of a fourth nonverbal test, a third configural sensitivity task, and a fourth force sensitivity task. Regression analyses across both studies revealed partial support for the association between perceptual sensitivity to spatiotemporal percepts and greater emotion perception accuracy. Results  indicate that accuracy in perceiving emotions may be predicted by sensitivity to specific percepts embedded within channel- and emotion-specific displays. The significance of such research lies in the understanding of how individuals acquire emotion perception skill and the processes by which distinct features of percepts are related to the perception of emotion."

abstract,"Abstract Both in the performative arts and in emotion research, professional actors are assumed to be capable of delivering emotions comparable to spontaneous emotional expressions. This study examines the effects of acting training on vocal emotion depiction and recognition. We predicted that professional actors express emotions in a more realistic fashion than non-professional actors. However, professional acting training may lead to a particular speech pattern; this might account for vocal expressions by actors that are less comparable to authentic samples than the ones by non-professional actors. We compared 80 emotional speech tokens from radio interviews with 80 re-enactments by professional and inexperienced actors, respectively. We analyzed recognition accuracies for emotion and authenticity ratings and compared the acoustic structure of the speech tokens. Both play-acted conditions yielded similar recognition accuracies and possessed more variable pitch contours than the spontaneous recordings. However, professional actors exhibited signs of different articulation patterns compared to non-trained speakers. Our results indicate that for emotion research, emotional expressions by professional actors are not better suited than those from non-actors."

abstract,"Abstract A trustworthy appearance is regarded as a marker of a globally positive personality and, thus, evokes a host of benevolent responses from perceivers.
 Nevertheless, it is yet to be determined whether the reverse is also true, that is, whether social targets who evoke unambiguously benign motivations in perceivers are regarded as possessing a more trustworthy appearance (cf. Oosterhof and Todorov in Emotion 9:128–133, 2008). To this end, elderly long-term married couples completed measures of partner-directed altruistic motivation, accommodative behaviors, marital satisfaction, and trust in the partner. They also completed a face-processing task involving spousal and stranger faces 1 year later. Higher motivation to prioritize a spouse’s well-being (but none of the other relationship functioning variables assessed) predicted perceiving one’s spouse’s emotionally neutral face as being more trustworthy-looking. Results  are discussed in the context of the reciprocal relationship between higher-order motivational processes and basic perceptual mechanisms in shaping relational climates."

abstract,"Abstract Research across animal species suggests that eye gaze plays an important role in dominance/submission interactions. In a confrontation, maintenance of eye contact may indicate a struggle for dominance whereas gaze aversion suggests a withdrawal from conflict. Past research has focused on measuring eye gaze patterns in various contexts. The current experiment directly manipulated eye gaze patterns toward versus away from the eyes of angry or non-emotional faces to study the impact on dominance-related self-perceptions and decisions on the ultimatum game. Maintaining eye contact led men to make more dominant choices on the ultimatum game. Maintaining eye contact with angry faces in particular caused an increase in self-perceptions of aggression, and self-perceptions of aggression predicted more dominant responses on the ultimatum game. Women also reported an increase in self-perceptions of aggression after maintaining eye contact with angry faces, but they did not behave in a more dominant fashion on the ultimatum game after maintaining direct eye contact with faces. These results suggest that eye gaze behavior can exert a causal influence on dominance-related responding."

abstract,"Abstract Beliefs about who typically expresses which emotions are deeply ingrained and likely affect how people perceive and respond to emotional displays by others. We examined how emotional expressions and social status separately and in combination affect how quickly participants can categorize faces by their gender. The speed with which people categorize targets is informative about what combinations are expected or not. In Study 1, participants categorized the gender of targets displaying angry, happy, and neutral expressions. Response times were slower to incongruent gender-emotion pairs (angry female faces, happy male faces) relative to both neutral and congruent expressions. In Study 2, participants again categorized the gender of targets, this time presented as having high or low status. Target status affected response times to female targets only. Female targets were categorized more slowly when they both had high status and expressed anger (vs. happiness or no emotion). No differences by emotion were found for low-status female targets. In sum, anger was incongruent with women at an automatic level both when they had high status and when their status was unmarked, whereas explicit low-status information eliminated this incongruity. These data confirm the existence of deeply-ingrained associations linking status, gender, and emotion and underscore the importance of emotional expression and status in how women are perceived."

abstract,"Abstract There is little consensus regarding how verticality (social power, dominance, and status) is related to accurate interpersonal perception. The relation could be either positive or negative, and there could be many causal processes at play. The present article discusses the theoretical possibilities and presents a meta-analysis of this question. In studies using a standard test of interpersonal accuracy, higher socioeconomic status (SES) predicted higher accuracy defined as accurate inference about the meanings of cues; also, higher experimentally manipulated vertical position predicted higher accuracy defined as accurate recall of others’ words. In addition, although personality dominance did not predict accurate inference overall, the type of personality dominance did, such that empathic/responsible dominance had a positive relation and egoistic/aggressive dominance had a negative relation to accuracy. In studies involving live interaction, higher experimentally manipulated vertical position produced lower accuracy defined as accurate inference about cues; however, methodological problems place this result in doubt."

history,"['2015-03', '2014-04-19']"
abstract,"Abstract Fearful facial expressions are salient nonverbal social cues that signal the existence of potential threat within the environment. These threat signals capture spatial attention both when processed consciously (unmasked) and nonconsciously (masked). Studies using masked fearful faces have most reliably found speeded orienting towards their location, but delayed disengagement from this location has also been observed. Surprisingly however, the extent to which orienting and disengagement processes underlie modulations in spatial attention to conscious/unmasked fearful faces has yet to be explored. Here, participants performed an unmasked and masked fearful face dot-probe task, which included a baseline condition to assess attentional orienting and disengagement effects. We found that both unmasked and masked fearful faces capture spatial attention through facilitated orienting and delayed disengagement. These results provide new evidence that consciously and nonconsciously processed social expressions of fear facilitate attention through similar mechanisms."

history,"['2015-03', '2014-07-16']"
abstract,"Abstract A persistent question in the deception literature has been the extent to which nonverbal behaviors can reliably distinguish between truth and deception. It has been argued that deception instigates cognitive load and arousal that are betrayed through visible nonverbal indicators. Yet, empirical evidence has often failed to find statistically significant or strong relationships. Given that interpersonal message production is characterized by a high degree of simultaneous and serial patterning among multiple behaviors, it may be that patterns of behaviors are more diagnostic of veracity. Or it may be that the theorized linkage between internal states of arousal, cognitive taxation, and efforts to control behavior and nonverbal behaviors are wrong. The current investigation addressed these possibilities by applying a software program called THEME to analyze the patterns of kinesic movements (adaptor gestures, illustrator gestures, and speaker and listener head movements) rated by trained coders for participants in a mock crime experiment. Our multifaceted analysis revealed that the quantity and quality of patterns distinguish truths from untruths. Quantitative and qualitative analyses conducted by case and condition revealed high variability in the types and complexities of patterns that were produced and differences between truthful and deceptive respondents questioned about a theft. Patterns incorporating adaptors and illustrator gestures were correlated in counterintuitive ways with arousal, cognitive load, and behavioral control, and qualitative analyses produced unique insights into truthful and untruthful communication."

Fifty-one pairs (N = 102) of opposite-sex heterosexual strangers interacted for 10–12 min and then reported their physical attraction to their conversational partner. Four independent coders coded 36 nonverbal and verbal behaviors. The residual variance of the interaction term between each flirting style and physical attraction was calculated, accounting for variance associated with the other styles. These five residual terms were separately correlated with the coded verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Each flirting style was correlated with behaviors linked to the conceptualization of that style: more conversational fluency for physical flirts, more demure behaviors for traditional female flirts and more assertive and open behaviors by traditional male flirts, less fidgeting, teasing, and distraction and more smiling for sincere flirts, more reserved and distancing behavior by polite flirts, and more obviously engaging and flirtatious behaviors by playful flirts."

The aim of this study, therefore, is to determine the degrees of perception and recognition of information broadcast by radio when the prosodic features used in the transmission are modified. The main conclusion reached is that there is indeed a relationship between the prosodic combination employed and the way in which such information is perceived and recognized, and providing that the prosodic features observe the principle of distinctive and contrastive coherence, the information is perceived positively and recognition is highest."

abstract,"Abstract This study examined people’s nonverbal reactions to being excluded during a social interaction. According to the ‘numbness hypothesis’, individuals who are being excluded may not display overt signs of distress but may lack in emotion and appear lethargic or numb instead. Nevertheless, the validity of this hypothesis has recently been questioned. In the present study, we hypothesized that the nonverbal behaviors of individuals who are being excluded are likely to be indicative of sadness and social withdrawal rather than numbness per se. For this purpose, participants were excluded or included during an interaction with two confederates. Automatic detection of facial expressions indicated that, although participants did display a more neutral face when they were excluded compared to when they were included, they also expressed more sadness and less joy. In addition, manual coding of nonverbal behaviors indicated that individuals who were excluded displayed fewer affiliative behaviors. These findings are not compatible with the numbness hypothesis. Individuals who are being excluded do display emotions (i.e., more sadness, less joy), be it that these emotions are typically associated with decreased energy levels and social disengagement."

abstract,"Abstract Gestures are commonly used together with spoken language in human communication. One major limitation of gesture investigations in the existing literature lies in the fact that the coding of forms and functions of gestures has not been clearly differentiated. This paper first described a recently developed Database of Speech and GEsture based on independent annotation of gesture forms and functions among 119 neurologically unimpaired right-handed native speakers of Cantonese (divided into three age and two education levels), and presented findings of an investigation examining how gesture use was related to age and linguistic performance. Consideration of these two factors, for which normative data are currently very limited or lacking in the literature, is relevant and necessary when one evaluates gesture employment among individuals with and without language impairment. Three speech tasks, including monologue of a personally important event, sequential description, and story-telling, were used for elicitation. The EUDICO Linguistic ANnotator software was used to independently annotate each participant’s linguistic information of the transcript, forms of gestures used, and the function for each gesture. About one-third of the subjects did not use any co-verbal gestures. While the majority of gestures were non-content-carrying, which functioned mainly for reinforcing speech intonation or controlling speech flow, the content-carrying ones were used to enhance speech content. Furthermore, individuals who are younger or linguistically more proficient tended to use fewer gestures, suggesting that normal speakers gesture differently as a function of age and linguistic performance."

abstract,"Abstract Although research succeeds in eliciting spontaneous feelings of surprise with participants, these participants rarely show a prototypical expression of raising eyebrows, opening mouth, and widening eyes. In other words, there seems to be a discrepancy between the display and feeling of surprise. To get a better understanding of this discrepancy, we assessed what factors influence the display of surprise in children (study 1) and adults (study 2). In both studies, we conducted a quiz-like experiment, in which we manipulated the social context (participants either competed or collaborated), and various quiz questions to extract reactions of surprise (either caused by unexpectedly correct or unexpectedly incorrect answers). Results  show that cause and social context did not affect the appearance of specific features in participants’ surprise display. However, we did find these factors to interact with regards to the intensity of perceived surprise displays of adults. For children, these relations were less complex. Overall, we can conclude that the expression of surprise is indeed moderated by contextual factors, namely cause of the surprise, social context, and age."

Observers (N = 35) completed the IPT-15 and SSI and then estimated each profile owner’s personality from the profile pages. Observers’ scores on the IPT-15 were positively associated with the accuracy of estimates of targets’ extraversion and neuroticism. Observers’ SSI-ES scores were positively associated with the accuracy of estimates of targets’ agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. Characteristics of targets, such as self-monitoring, FB honesty, and overall FB use, also affected the accuracy of estimates. Results  demonstrate that offline measures of sensitivity are associated with the accuracy of online personality judgments."

abstract,"Abstract 
We report on what, to our knowledge, represents the first study of nonverbal emotional behavior in crowded public places combining naturalistic videotaping of situated activity, objective coding of facial movement, and sequential analysis of behavior. In the first part of the study we argue that passengers do not lose emotional sensitivity to physical contact as density (passengers per square meter) increases, which indicates that physical contact is experienced as a territorial intrusion regardless of crowdedness. In the second part of the study, we suggest that passengers resolve the emotions due to intrusive physical contacts through two interactional strategies involving facial movements usually interpreted as “expressions of emotions.” Since proxemic violations seem to represent a pervasive emotion elicitor, the protocol can be extended to other means of transportation and replicated in other locations. We conclude that the methodology provides an effective tool for theory-building in the study of nonverbal emotional behavior."

Facebook messages were varied so that participants (n = 821) viewed a message containing text only or text plus either an attractive or unattractive photo of the sender, a winking face emoticon, words in all capitals, or triple exclamation points. Participants were then asked to indicate the degree of negative emotion they would feel if they saw this message on their romantic partner’s Facebook wall. The addition of wink-face emoticons and physical attractiveness cues in a Facebook wall post contributed to differences in likely experienced emotion. Participants also reported a greater likelihood of experiencing negative emotion if they were high in preoccupied attachment and low in dismissive attachment. Finally, women reported being more likely to experience negative interpersonal affect in response to the Facebook post than did men. Implications for the role nonverbal cues play in computer-mediated contexts, such as Facebook, are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Cross-cultural and laboratory research indicates that some facial expressions of emotion are recognized more accurately and faster than others. We assessed the hypothesis that such differences depend on the frequency with which each expression occurs in social encounters. Thirty observers recorded how often they saw different facial expressions during natural conditions in their daily life. For a total of 90 days (3 days per observer), 2,462 samples of seen expressions were collected. Among the basic expressions, happy faces were observed most frequently (31 %), followed by surprised (11.3 %), sad (9.3 %), angry (8.7 %), disgusted (7.2 %), and fearful faces, which were the least frequent (3.4 %). A significant amount (29 %) of non-basic emotional expressions (e.g., pride or shame) were also observed. We correlated our frequency data with recognition accuracy and response latency data from prior studies. In support of the hypothesis, significant correlations (generally, above .70) emerged, with recognition accuracy increasing and latency decreasing as a function of frequency. We conclude that the efficiency of facial emotion recognition is modulated by familiarity of the expressions."

history,"['2014-12', '2014-07-30']"
abstract,"Abstract Using vignettes and online photos, this study explored the relationship between touch intimacy, biological sex, attachment, and the experience of jealous emotions in the context of seeing one’s partner touch a close, opposite-sex friend. Results  indicated that hypothetical scenarios elicited significant emotional responses and increases in touch intimacy (as depicted in digital photos) heightened these responses. Males indicated more sexual arousal when seeing their partners interacting with a friend, while females indicated more sadness, fear, and envy. In terms of attachment, preoccupied individuals expressed the most anger and fear, dismissives and secures expressed the least envy and embarrassment, dismissives expressed the least fear, and fearfuls expressed the most sexual arousal. The two forms of touch (face touch and lower back touch) elicited stronger jealous emotions (anger, sadness, fear, and embarrassment) than no touch. Lastly, in regards to lower back touch, fearfully attached males responded with the most fear, females with the most anger, sadness, fear, and envy, and fearfully attached individuals the least amount of fear. This occurred despite the fact that face touch was characterized as more intimate than lower back touch; our results suggest that this form of touch may have been perceived as sexual. We relate our findings to the context of viewing digital photos on social networking websites."

history,"['2014-12', '2014-08-09']"
abstract,"Abstract Recent research has stressed the importance of using multimodal and dynamic features to investigate the role of nonverbal behavior in social perception. This paper examines the influence of low-level visual and auditory cues on the communication of agreement, disagreement, and the ability to convince others. In addition, we investigate whether the judgment of these attitudes depends on ratings of socio-emotional dimensions such as dominance, arousal, and valence. The material we used consisted of audio–video excerpts that represent statements of agreement and disagreement, as well as neutral utterances taken from political discussions. Each excerpt was rated on a number of dimensions: agreement, disagreement, dominance, valence, arousal, and convincing power in three rating conditions: audio-only, video-only, and audio–video. We extracted low-level dynamic visual features using optical flow. Auditory features consisted of pitch measurements, vocal intensity, and articulation rate. Results  show that judges were able to distinguish statements of disagreement from agreement and neutral utterances on the basis of nonverbal cues alone, in particular, when both auditory and visual information were present. Visual features were more influential when presented along with auditory features. Perceivers mainly used changes in pitch and the maximum speed of vertical movements to infer agreement and disagreement, and targets appeared more convincing when they showed consistent and rapid movements on the vertical plane. The effect of nonverbal features on ratings of agreement and disagreement was completely mediated by ratings of dominance, valence, and arousal, indicating that the impact of low-level audio–visual features on the perception of agreement and disagreement depends on the perception of fundamental socio-emotional dimensions."

keyword,"['Social networking sites\xa0', 'Relational transgressions\xa0', 'Power\xa0']"
history,"['2014-12', '2014-08-09']"
abstract,"Abstract Dependence power is defined by the control a less dependent partner is perceived to have by the more dependent individual in a close relationship. Guided by assumptions about dependence power, we examined how individuals manage perceived relational transgressions by partners on Facebook, distinguishing between face-to-face responses versus those that are expressed nonverbally (through monitoring or maintenance behaviors) on the site. Participants included 290 females and 210 males in a dating relationship who completed measures of dependence power and Facebook use. Participants then viewed a screenshot reflecting a hypothetical Facebook partner transgression that varied by potential threat (high versus low). Finally, participants completed measures of perceived threat and a measure of responses to the transgression (monitoring and maintenance). Dependence power was associated with perceptions of the threat of a transgression, the likelihood of confronting a partner face-to-face about the perceived transgression, and engaging in Facebook monitoring behavior after a perceived transgression. Dependence power was not significantly associated with maintenance responses."

history,"['2014-09', '2014-04-29']"
abstract,"Abstract This study examined the validity and possible utility of a new procedure for the extraction of nonverbal behaviors from dyadic conversation. Three methods were used to extract nonverbal behaviors (i.e., hand gestures, adaptors, and utterances). A novel automated method employing video images and speech-signal analysis software programs was compared to the more traditional coding and behavioral rating methods. The automated and coding methods provided an objective count of how many times a target behavior occurred, while behavioral ratings were based on more subjective impressions. Although there was no difference between the automated and coding methods for hand gestures, the coding method using an event recorder yielded marginally significantly more instances of adaptors and utterances as compared to the software programs. Measures of each nonverbal behavior were positively correlated across the different methods. In addition, interpersonal impressions of each speaker were rated by both observers and conversational partners. Although R 2 was lower than for the coding/behavioral rating methods, nonverbal behaviors extracted using the software programs significantly predicted familiarity and activeness ratings from both observer and partner points of view. These results support the validity and possible utility of the software-based automated extraction procedure."

abstract,"Abstract A brief touch to the shoulder or upper arm increases people’s helping behavior and willingness to comply with requests. In this manuscript, we investigate whether this well-known Midas touch effect is also operative in mediated interactions where the touch act is replaced by electromechanical stimulation through a tactile display. With two experiments (one with an informed and one with a blind confederate) and a meta-analysis, we demonstrate that stimulation through a tactile display can induce similar helping behavior as actual interpersonal physical contact. This virtual Midas touch effect suggests that electromechanical stimuli are processed in ways similar to actual touch. Our experiments thus have important implications for the design of communication media, which, to date, do not support physical contact. At the same time, the results illustrate the promising use of tactile displays in touch research, for example, to avoid the confederate bias intrinsic to studies in naturalistic settings."

abstract,"Abstract Mobile communication technology plays an increasingly pervasive role in everyday life. This study examined one aspect of this role, specifically, the effects of mobile device use on the micro-interactions of pedestrians as they approached and passed a confederate. Over 400 participants were observed in a 2 (group: mobile device vs. control) × 3 [condition: look-only (L); look and smile (LS); look, smile, and greeting (LSG)] factorial design study measuring participants’ looks, smiles, nods, and greetings toward the confederates. Log-linear analyses of the dependent measures provided qualified support for the predicted decreased responsiveness from mobile device users. Specifically, a group by condition interaction on smiles showed that significantly fewer mobile device users than controls smiled at the confederates in the LSG condition. In addition, a group by sex of participant interaction on greetings indicated that significantly fewer female mobile device users offered greetings than males and females in the other conditions. The processes potentially mediating these effects are discussed and the broader influence of mobile devices on the micro-interactions of pedestrians is considered."

abstract,"Abstract In the current study we administered a creative task in which two people collaboratively generated novel strategies to conserve resources. During this task, the nonverbal behavior of 104 participants in 52 pairs was tracked and recorded using the Kinect computer vision algorithm. We created a measure of synchrony by correlating movements between the two dyad members, and showed that synchrony occurred—that is, correlations decreased when we increased delay between the recorded movements of pair members. We also demonstrated a link between nonverbal synchrony and creativity, as operationalized by the number of new, valid ideas produced. Linear correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between synchrony and creativity. Finally, models using synchrony scores as input predicted whether dyads were high or low in creativity with a success rate as high as 86.7 % in the more exclusive subsets. We discuss implications for methodological approaches to measuring nonverbal behavior and synchrony, and suggest practical applications which can leverage the current findings."

abstract,"Abstract Videoconferencing (VC) is changing the way people communicate in a variety of fields including education, medicine, business, and even interpersonal relationships. In this study, we investigate the effects of the modality of communication, whether through face-to-face (FtF) or VC, on the ability of interactants to develop and maintain nonverbal synchrony. This study is an analysis of 101 interviews between students and professional interviewers in which some of the participants were induced to cheat on a task with a confederate. The results revealed that the VC modality hampered the interactional synchrony of the dyads, especially during the phases of questioning when suspicion-inducing or accusatory questioning was used. For global ratings of synchrony, the greatest impact of modality was for participants whose lies were not sanctioned by the interviewer, suggesting that the VC modality negatively affected the most skilled deceivers. In addition, interactional synchrony improved in the final, accusatory, phase of the interview when subjects confessed, particularly in the FtF modality. The effects of the interviewer and the question type are also discussed."

history,"['2014-09', '2014-04-11']"
abstract,"Abstract The digital age has brought with it new and powerful computer-based methods of analyzing heretofore elusive patterns of nonverbal behavior. C-BAS (Meservy 2010) is a computer-assisted behavioral observation tool for identifying and tracking nonverbal behaviors from video. THEME (Magnusson, The hidden structure of interaction: from neurons to culture patterns, IOS Press, Amsterdam, pp 4–22, 2005) is a software program that discovers patterns among discrete events in time-ordered data. Together, these tools enable more precise measurement and analysis of nonverbal behavioral dynamics. Applications to three corpora derived from interpersonal deception experiments reveal unique nonverbal patterns that distinguish deceptive from nondeceptive interactions. The first and second experiments produced serial, hierarchically related patterns of behaviors that differed in length and complexity between truthful and deceptive participants during interviews about a theft and cheating, respectively. The third experiment produced differential patterns by and among group members completing a task. Deceivers were inclined toward strategic initiations and interactional control, whereas suspicious group members adopted a more passive, possibly watchful stance. Discovery of these patterns challenges the prevailing view that nonverbal behaviors are too faint and inconsistent to identify deceptive communication. Results  have numerous implications regarding the following: the development of new measurement tools locating significant effects of nonverbal behaviors, support for theory that coherent and repetitive relationships exist within and among interactants’ communication, demonstration of the role of nonverbal behaviors in deceptive communication and the dynamic and strategic nature of deception."

abstract,"Abstract Human–human communication studies have suggested that within communicative interactions, individuals acknowledge each other as intentional agents and adjust their emotion nonverbal behavior according to the other. This process has been defined as emotional attunement. In this study, we examine the emotional attunement process in the context of affective human–computer interactions. To this purpose, participants were exposed to one of two conditions. In one case, they played with a computer that simulated understanding of their emotional reactions while guiding them across four different game-like activities; in the other, the computer guided participants across the activities without mentioning any ability to understand emotional responses. Face movements, gaze direction, posture, vocal behavior, electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity were simultaneously recorded during the experimental sessions. Results  showed that if participants were aware of interacting with an agent able to recognize their emotions, they reported that the computer was able to “understand” them and showed a higher number of nonverbal behaviors during the most interactive activity. The implications are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Visuospatial working memory is thought to be responsible for imagery generation (Cattaneo et al. in Imagery and spatial cognition: methods, models and cognitive assessment, John Benjamins Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 2006). This memory system was manipulated by varying visual perceptual input (see Baddeley and Andrade in Theories of memory, Psychology Press, Hove, 1998) in a narrative task in order to investigate the association between iconic gesture production and visuospatial working memory interference. Participants watched two short cartoon clips and were asked to relay a narrative about what they had seen in the videos to an experimenter. Participants were randomly assigned to relay their narrative while wearing video glasses with either a simple or complex moving image (unrelated to the cartoons) projected onto the lenses. It was hypothesized that if gesture production plays a role in facilitating visuospatial working memory resource activation, then participants in the complex visual distractor condition would display a higher rate of gesture production. Participants in the complex visual distractor condition gestured significantly more than participants in the simple visual distractor condition. These results are interpreted as lending support to the argument that iconic gestures may play a functional role in activating visuospatial working memory resources during a narrative task. Since visuospatial working memory is thought to support imagery, these results also suggest that gesture production may facilitate imagery generation."

abstract,"Abstract Although research has demonstrated the manifestation of racial bias by measuring overt attitudes and behaviors, there has been little examination of the subtle nonverbal cues that may also characterize such bias. The present study investigates implicit racial bias by analyzing nonverbal behaviors of individuals shown video of a criminal suspect whose ethnic identity is manipulated to be Black or White. Participants appeared significantly more uncertain about what they were saying when describing the White suspect than when describing the Black suspect. Participants were also more likely to display “open” posture when describing the Black suspect but “closed” posture (e.g., crossed arms) when describing the White suspect. The results indicate that biases in attitudes and beliefs might be reliably detected and measured through body language. The findings are discussed in terms of how nonverbal behaviors may reveal more subtle forms of prejudice and miscommunication. Contextual correlations between specific nonverbal behaviors and affective states are also discussed."

abstract,"Abstract The present study was conducted to determine the extent to which different nonverbal behaviors were associated with romantic interest in a highly attractive confederate and whether these behaviors differed as a function of relationship status and self-reported love for one’s partner. Mimicry was positively associated with romantic interest in the confederate, and consistent with the devaluation hypothesis, mimicry was negatively associated with self-reported love for one’s partner, suggesting that mimicry functions to signal preferred social distance. In addition, smiling and vocal pleasantness emerged as important affiliative nonverbal behaviors. The present results suggest that mimicry acts as a relationship-maintenance mechanism, one that is expressed automatically, unintentionally, and nonconsciously. Implications for the role of nonconscious mimicry in romantic attraction and relationship-maintenance processes are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract We investigated persuasiveness as a social outcome of the ability to produce a deliberate Duchenne smile in a role-play task and of a participant’s use of a Duchenne smile while persuading someone in a live interaction. Participants were tasked with persuading an experimenter to drink a pleasant and unpleasant tasting juice as well as not drink a pleasant and unpleasant juice while being videotaped. Participants’ deliberate Duchenne smiling ability was measured by asking participants to smile while acting out “genuine happiness” and also to mask imagined negative affect with a smile. Smiles in the deliberate Duchenne smiling task and the persuasion task were coded for presence of the Duchenne marker, and naïve viewers of the persuasion task made ratings of how pleasant they thought the juice was. Results  showed further evidence that a sizeable minority of people can deliberately produce a Duchenne smile and showed that those with this ability are more persuasive. When persuading to drink the pleasant tasting juice, the correlation between the ability to produce a deliberate Duchenne smile and persuasion was partially due to the use of the Duchenne smile while persuading, but this was not the case with the unpleasant tasting juice. When persuading to drink the unpleasant juice, participants who could deliberately put on the Duchenne smile were more persuasive but their persuasiveness was not the result of using a Duchenne smile during the persuasion task."

abstract,"Abstract Character judgments, based on facial appearance, impact both perceivers’ and targets’ interpersonal decisions and behaviors. Nonetheless, the resilience of such effects in the face of longer acquaintanceship duration is yet to be determined. To address this question, we had 51 elderly long-term married couples complete self and informant versions of a Big Five Inventory. Participants were also photographed, while they were requested to maintain an emotionally neutral expression. A subset of the initial sample completed a shortened version of the Big Five Inventory in response to the pictures of other opposite sex participants (with whom they were unacquainted). Oosterhof and Todorov’s (in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:11087–11092, 2008) computer-based model of face evaluation was used to generate facial trait scores on trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness, based on participants’ photographs. Results  revealed that structural facial characteristics, suggestive of greater trustworthiness, predicted positively biased, global informant evaluations of a target’s personality, among both spouses and strangers. Among spouses, this effect was impervious to marriage length. There was also evidence suggestive of a Dorian Gray effect on personality, since facial trustworthiness predicted not only spousal and stranger, but also self-ratings of extraversion. Unexpectedly, though, follow-up analyses revealed that (low) facial dominance, rather than (high) trustworthiness, was the strongest predictor of self-rated extraversion. Our present findings suggest that subtle emotional cues, embedded in the structure of emotionally neutral faces, exert long-lasting effects on personality judgments even among very well-acquainted targets and perceivers."

In a job interview, the applicant’s vocal and visual nonverbal immediacy behavior was automatically sensed and extracted. Results  show that the applicant’s nonverbal behavior can be validly extracted. Moreover, both visual and vocal applicant nonverbal behavior predict recruiter hiring decision, which is in line with previous findings on manually coded applicant nonverbal behavior. Finally, applicant average turn duration, tempo variation, and gazing best predict recruiter hiring decision. Results  and implications of such a nonverbal social sensing for future research are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Increasing evidence suggests that Duchenne (D) smiles may not only occur as a sign of spontaneous enjoyment, but can also be deliberately posed. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether people mimic spontaneous and deliberate D and non-D smiles to a similar extent. Facial EMG responses were recorded while participants viewed short video-clips of each smile category which they had to judge with respect to valence, arousal, and genuineness. In line with previous research, valence and arousal ratings varied significantly as a function of smile type and elicitation condition. However, differences in facial reactions occurred only for smile type (i.e., D and non-D smiles). The findings have important implications for questions relating to the role of facial mimicry in expression understanding and suggest that mimicry may be essential in discriminating among various meanings of smiles."

It was completed by 541 young adults (45 % men) in Study 1 and 649 young adults (40 % men) in Study 2. The results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses showed that a bi-factor model, with one general factor and four specific factors was supported. The general and specific factors were differentially related to self-other differentiation, empathy, emotional fragility, masculinity, and femininity. Notwithstanding, the results posited some questions about the ECS reliability and convergent validity. Implications for scoring of the ECS and the need to revise it are discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Aiming at a more comprehensive assessment of nonverbal vocal emotion communication, this article presents the development and validation of a new rating instrument for the assessment of perceived voice and speech features. In two studies, using two different sets of emotion portrayals by German and French actors, ratings of perceived voice and speech characteristics (loudness, pitch, intonation, sharpness, articulation, roughness, instability, and speech rate) were obtained from non-expert (untrained) listeners. In addition, standard acoustic parameters were extracted from the voice samples. Overall, highly similar patterns of results were found in both studies. Rater agreement (reliability) reached highly satisfactory levels for most features. Multiple discriminant analysis results reveal that both perceived vocal features and acoustic parameters allow a high degree of differentiation of the actor-portrayed emotions. Positive emotions can be classified with a higher hit rate on the basis of perceived vocal features, confirming suggestions in the literature that it is difficult to find acoustic valence indicators. The results show that the suggested scales (Geneva Voice Perception Scales) can be reliably measured and make a substantial contribution to a more comprehensive assessment of the process of emotion inferences from vocal expression."

history,"['2014-03', '2013-10-26']"
abstract,"Abstract Morality is a prominent guide of both action and perception. We argue that non-emotional gestures can prime the abstract concept of honesty. Four studies demonstrated that the emblematic gesture associated with honesty (putting a hand on one’s heart) increased the level of honesty perceived by others, and increased the honesty shown in one’s own behavior. Target persons performing this gesture were described in terms associated with honesty, and appeared more trustworthy to others than when the same targets were photographed with a control gesture. Persons performing the hand-over-heart gesture provided more honest assessments of others’ attractiveness, and refrained from cheating, as compared to persons performing neutral gestures. These findings suggest that bodily experience associated with abstract concepts can influence both one’s perceptions of others, and one’s own complex actions. Further, our findings suggest that this influence is not mediated by changes in affective states."

abstract,"Abstract Evidence suggests that people can manipulate their vocal intonations to convey a host of emotional, trait, and situational images. We asked 40 participants (20 men and 20 women) to intentionally manipulate the sound of their voices in order to portray four traits: attractiveness, confidence, dominance, and intelligence to compare these samples to their normal speech. We then asked independent raters of the same- and opposite-sex to assess the degree to which each voice sample projected the given trait. Women’s manipulated voices were judged as sounding more attractive than their normal voices, but this was not the case for men. In contrast, men’s manipulated voices were rated by women as sounding more confident than their normal speech, but this did not hold true for women’s voices. Further, women were able to manipulate their voices to sound just as dominant as the men’s manipulated voices, and both sexes were able to modify their voices to sound more intelligent than their normal voice. We also assessed all voice samples objectively using spectrogram analyses and several vocal patterns emerged for each trait; among them we found that when trying to sound sexy/attractive, both sexes slowed their speech and women lowered their pitch and had greater vocal hoarseness. Both sexes raised their pitch and spoke louder to sound dominant and women had less vocal hoarseness. These findings are discussed using an evolutionary perspective and implicate voice modification as an important, deliberate aspect of communication, especially in the realm of mate selection and competition."

abstract,"Abstract Alcohol dependent patients (ADs) are known to encounter severe interpersonal problems. Nonverbal communication skills are important for the development of healthy relationships. The present study aimed to explore emotional facial expression (EFE) recognition and posed and spontaneous EFE expressivity in male ADs divided into two groups according to Cloninger’s typology and the impact of their interpersonal relationship quality on the potential nonverbal deficits. Twenty type I ADs, twenty-one type II ADs, and twenty control participants took part in an EFE recognition task and an EFE expressivity task that considered personal emotional events (spontaneous expressivity) and EFE in response to a photo or word cue (posed expressivity). Coding was based on judges’ ratings of participants’ emotional facial expressions. Participants additionally completed a questionnaire on interpersonal relationship quality. No difference between the three groups emerged in the EFE recognition task. Type II ADs showed heightened deficits compared with type I ADs in EFE expressivity: Judges perceived less accurate posed EFE in response to a cue word and less intense and positive spontaneous EFE in type II ADs compared to control participants. In addition, type II ADs reported more relationship difficulties compared to both type I ADs and control participants. These interpersonal relationship difficulties were related to some of the EFE expressivity deficits of AD-IIs. This study underlines the important differences between the interpersonal functioning of AD subtypes."

abstract,"Abstract The present research explores the link between the personality trait exploitativeness, a component of narcissism, and emotion recognition abilities. Prior research on this topic has produced inconsistent findings. We attempt to resolve these inconsistencies by testing the hypothesis that narcissistic exploitativeness, in particular, should be associated with emotion-reading abilities because it specifically taps into the motivation to manipulate others. Across two studies we find that narcissistic exploitativeness is indeed associated with increased emotion recognition, but in some cases the confounding effects of mood need to be considered (Study 1). Importantly, effect sizes of narcissistic exploitativeness were similar in magnitude to two different measures of dispositional empathy, which is an established correlate of emotion recognition. These studies suggest that emotional recognition abilities are associated with desirable and undesirable traits."

abstract,"Abstract Languages employ different strategies to mark an utterance as a polar (yes–no) question, including syntax, intonation and gestures. This study analyzes the production and perception of information-seeking questions and broad focus statements in Dutch and Catalan. These languages use intonation for marking questionhood, but Dutch also exploits syntactic variation for this purpose. A production task revealed the expected language-specific auditory differences, but also showed that gaze and eyebrow-raising are used in this distinction. A follow-up perception experiment revealed that perceivers relied greatly on auditory information in determining whether an utterance is a question or a statement, but accuracy was further enhanced when visual information was added. Finally, the study demonstrates that the concentration of several response-mobilizing cues in a sentence is positively correlated with the perceivers’ ratings of these utterances as interrogatives."

history,"['2014-03', '2013-10-19']"
abstract,"Abstract The goal of the paper was to test if humans can detect whether athletes are trailing or leading in sports based on the perception of thin slices of athletes’ nonverbal behavior. In Experiment 1, participants who were unexperienced in the respective sports watched short videos depicting basketball and table tennis players and rated whether athletes were trailing or leading. Results  indicated that participants could significantly differentiate between trailing and leading athletes in both team and individual sports. Experiment 2 showed that children were also able to distinguish between trailing and leading athletes based on nonverbal behavior. Comparison with the adult results from Experiment 1 revealed that the adult ratings corresponded to a higher degree with the actual scores during the game compared to the children’s. In Experiment 3, we replicated the findings from Experiment 1 with both expert and unexperienced participants and a different set of stimuli from team handball. Both experts and unexpert participants were able to differentiate between leading and trailing athletes. Our findings are in line with evolutionary accounts of nonverbal behavior and suggest that humans display nonverbal signals as a consequence of leading or trailing which are reliably interpreted by others. By comparing this effect as a function of different age groups we provide evidence that although even young children can differentiate between leading and trailing athletes, the decoding of subtle nonverbal cues continues to develop with increasing experience and maturation processes."

abstract,"Abstract To reduce harmful sulfur content in lubricant additives, making use of isosterism has been shown to be an effective strategy. When thiobenzothiazole compounds were used as templates, the exchange of sulfur atoms in the thiazole ring with oxygen atoms and NH groups produced twelve isosteres. Similarly, 2-benzothiazole- S-carboxylic acid esters were used as template molecules to produce six isosteres. About 30% of the isosteres exhibited a satisfactory deviation of ±5% relative to the template, ignoring the specific changes in the base oils, the differences in molecular structure, and the friction or wear properties. The template molecules and isosteres in triisodecyl trimellitate exhibited better tribological properties than in trimethylolpropane trioleate or bis(2- ethylhexyl) adipate. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA)- and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA)-quantitative structure tribo-ability relationship (QSTR) models were employed to study the correlation of molecular structures between the base oils and additives. The models indicate that the higher the structural similarities of the base oils and additives are, the more synergetic the molecular force fields of the lubricating system are; the molecular force fields creating synergistic effects will improve tribological performance."

abstract,Abstract The film forming condition may transit into thin film lubrication (TFL) at high speeds when it is under severe starvation. Central film thicknesses and film thickness profiles are obtained via a technique of relative optical interference intensity. These profiles show a critical film thickness lower than which the absolute values of the film thickness gradient against speed or time decrease. It is possible to be in the thin film lubrication mode under such conditions. The high speed flow drives the lubricant molecules to rearrange in TFL and critical film thickness higher than 100 nm is achieved. The viscosity is one of the main factors controlling the decreasing rate and the critical film thickness. This paper is designed to investigate the thin film lubrication behavior at high speeds.

abstract,"Abstract Polymer tribology is a fast growing area owing to increasing applications of polymers and polymer composites in industry, transportation, and many other areas of economy. Surface forces are very important for polymer contact, but the real origin of such forces has not been fully investigated. Strong adhesive interaction between polymers leads to an increase in the friction force, and hence, the asperities of the material may be removed to form wear particles or transfer layers on the counterface. The theory of polymer adhesion has not been completely elucidated yet and several models of adhesion have been proposed from the physical or chemical standpoints. This paper is focused on the research efforts on polymer adhesion with emphasis on adhesion mechanisms, which are very important in the analysis of polymer friction and wear."

abstract,"Abstract The combined effect of the use of carbon fiber and seawater and the molecular structure on the tribological behavior of various polymer materials under natural seawater lubrication was investigated. After the investigation, the wear morphology of the contact surface was observed by a laser scanning confocal microscope, and the texture of the wear scars and tracks were presented in 3D profiles. Moreover, the mechanism of mixed lubrication and wear resistance was analyzed. The results demonstrated that the friction coefficient of carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFRPEEK) is the lowest and fluctuates at approximately 0.11. Moreover, the seven polymer materials in ascending order of friction coefficients are CFRPEEK, carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide-imide, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyoxymethylene, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin, and glass fiber–epoxy resin. More critically, the simultaneous incorporation of deposition, polymeric scrap, hydrophilic groups, and seawater resulted in a decrease in the friction and wear of polymer materials under seawater lubrication. This observation implies that a synergistic friction-reducing and wear-resistant effect exists between carbon fiber, seawater, and the molecular structure of PEEK. As a result, a highly effective polymer material was discovered, CFRPEEK, which has the lowest friction coefficient of 0.11 and lowest wear rate of 2 × 10–5 mm3·(N·m)−1 among the polymer materials; this validates the selection of dual friction pairs for seawater hydraulic components."

Finally, present and potential space applications of the friction material are also introduced based on experimental studies."

The thermal and corrosion properties, as well as viscosity, of the prepared ILs were examined. The results revealed that the anion structure of ILs plays a dominant role in their thermal and viscosity behavior. These ILs exhibited less corrosion toward copper, related to their halogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorus-free characteristics. The tribological behavior of the synthesized ILs was examined using a Schwingungs Reibung und Verschleiss tester, and the results indicated that these ILs exhibit good friction-reducing and anti-wear properties as lubricants for steel/steel contact. Results  from energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the good tribological properties of [Ch][AA] ILs are related to the formation of a physically adsorbed film on the metal surface during friction."

abstract,"Abstract The effect of galvanically induced potentials on the friction and wear behavior of a 1RK91 stainless steel regarding to tribocorrosion was investigated using an oscillating ball-on-disk tribometer equipped with an electrochemical cell. The aim of this investigation is to develop a water-based lubricant. Therefore 1 molar sodium chloride (NaCl) and 1% 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C2mim][Cl] water solutions were used. Tribological performance at two galvanically induced potentials was compared with the non-polarized state: cathodic potential-coupling with pure aluminum- and anodic potential-coupling with pure copper. Frictional and electrochemical response was recorded during the tests. In addition, wear morphology and chemical composition of the steel were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively.The galvanically induced cathodic polarization of the stainless steel surface results in electrochemical corrosion protection and the formation of a tribolayer. Cations from the electrolyte (sodium Na+ and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium [C2mim]+) interact and adhere on the surface. These chemical interactions lead to considerably reduced wear using 1 NaCl (86%) and 1% 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [C2mim][Cl] (74%) compared to the nonpolarized system. In addition, mechanical and corrosive part of wear was identified using this electrochemical technique. Therefore this method describes a promising method to develop water-based lubricants for technical applications."

abstract,"Abstract The process of a cluster-containing water jet impinging on a monocrystalline silicon substrate was studied by molecular dynamics simulation. The results show that as the standoff distance increases, the jet will gradually diverge. As a result, the solidified water film between the cluster and the substrate becomes “thicker” and “looser”. The “thicker” and “looser” water film will then consume more input energy to achieve complete solidification, resulting in the stress region and the high-pressure region of the silicon substrate under small standoff distances to be significantly larger than those under large standoff distances. Therefore, the degree of damage sustained by the substrate will first experience a small change and then decrease quickly as the standoff distance increases. In summary, the occurrence and maintenance of complete solidification of the confined water film between the cluster and the substrate plays a decisive role in the level of damage formation on the silicon substrate. These findings are helpful for exploring the mechanism of an abrasive water jet."

abstract,"Abstract In the classical study of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) which does not employ real, measurable viscosity in analysis, the possibility of a glass transition has not been considered in many years. Indeed, the two rheological assumptions of classical EHL, the Newtonian inlet and the equivalence of a traction curve to a flow curve, would not have persisted so long had the pressure dependence of the viscosity been accurately stated. With the recent appearance of viscosity obtained from viscometers in EHL analysis, the possibility of a glass transition in the contact should be reexamined, especially for the fragile traction fluids. This article employs published data for a synthetic cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon to estimate the glass transition viscosity so that, when using real viscosities in EHL simulations, the state of the liquid may be assessed. Far into the glassy state the liquid should be treated as an elastic solid with a yield stress."

Most of them were designed and constructed to allow investigations of real machine components and to furnish more realistic results than basic tribological test rigs.Tilting pad journal bearings, as well as gears and complete gearboxes for advanced industrial applications, can be tested using the rigs described in the paper. A novel test rig with a power rating of approximately 1 MW allows investigations of the static and dynamic characteristics of high-performance tilting pad journal bearings for turbomachinery. A twin disc machine and closed loop gear test rig are used to investigate the different kinds of wear mechanisms occurring in gears. Functional and durability tests on planetary gearboxes for new turbo-fan engines could be performed using another novel large test rig. A circulating power configuration was adopted for most of the rigs so that only the power needed to cover the friction losses has to be supplied, while the circulating power can be more than 20 times higher. All the test rigs include very complex load applications and lubrication plants, as well as dedicated control and data acquisition systems.The rigs and related plants were designed and constructed through strong and fruitful collaborations between the university and some large and small–medium companies. Despite some limitations in the publication of the results as a result of the industrial sensitivity of the data, the synergy among these different actors was stimulating and fundamental for the realization of new advanced industrial applications."

abstract,"Abstract Wear is an important factor for failures of mechanical components. Current research on wear is mainly focused on experiments while the numerical simulation of wear is hardly used owing to the complexities of the wear process. Explaining the effect of friction on the wear process is important, as it will lead to a deeper understanding of the evolution of wear. This study proposed a numerical method to expound the wear process in the contact between an elastic cylinder and a half-space simulating the ring-block tester. There are two difficulties during the calculation; one is that the contact shapes vary with time, causing the pressure distribution to change simultaneously and the other is the integral equation for calculating the contact pressure under different worn shapes. In the present study, the wear rate was computed using Archard’s law and the wear process was calculated step by step until the specified total sliding distance was achieved. During each step of the calculation, the contact topography was updated. The simulation intuitively reproduced the contact state of change from line to surface contact throughout the wear process. Reasonable agreements on the changes of the wear scar, achieved from experiments and numerical simulations, were obtained."

abstract,"Abstract This study achieved water-based superlubricity with the lubrication of H3PO4 solution in vacuum (highest vacuum degree <10–4 torr) for the first time by performing a pre-running process in air before running in vacuum. The stable water-based superlubricity was sustainable in vacuum (0.02 torr) for 14 h until the test was stopped by the user for non-experimental factor. A further analysis suggested that the superlubricity may be attributed to the phosphoric acid–water network formed in air, which can efficiently lock water molecules in the liquid lubricating film even in vacuum owing to the strong hydrogen bond interaction. Such capability to lock water is strongly affected by the strength of hydrogen bond and environmental conditions. The realization of water-based superlubricity with H3PO4 solution in vacuum can lead to its application in space environment."

The study showed a reduction in wear and friction coefficient with increasing nanoparticle concentration. The cutting fluid performance was investigated using minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) in the turning of AISI 304 stainless steel. Regression models were developed for measuring the temperature and tool flank wear in terms of cutting speed, feed, depth of the cut, and nanoparticle concentration using response surface methodology.

abstract,"Abstract Hot pressed silicon carbide (SiC) composites prepared with 0, 10, 30 or 50 wt% tungsten carbide (WC) are subjected to dry sliding wear against WC-Co and steel ball. In particular an attempt has been made to answer the following important questions: (i) How does the load (from 5 to 20 N) effect sliding wear behaviour of SiC-ceramics against WC-Co and steel counterbodies? (ii) Is there any effect of WC content on friction and wear characteristics of SiC ceramics? (iii) Does the dominant material removal mechanism of SiC ceramics change with the addition of WC or counterbody? (iv) What is the influence of mechanical properties on the sliding wear? Experimental results indicated that coefficient of friction (COF) for the SiC ceramics varied between 0.66 and 0.33 with change in load and counterbodies. Wear volume for SiC ceramics found approximately 6−10 times more against WC-Co as compared against steel. Wear volume changes from 2.0 × 10–3 mm3 to 1.2 × 10–2 mm3 with change in counterbodies for SiC-(10, 30 or 50 wt%) WC composite at 20 N. SiC ceramics indicated abrasion and composites reveal tribochemical wear as major material removal mechanisms. Wear is influenced by the hardness of counterbody and fracture toughness of SiC-WC composites."

Contrary to previous studies of this mode of active control of friction, we consider the influence of the stiffness of the tribological contact in detail and show that the contact stiffness plays a central role for small oscillation amplitudes. In the present paper we consider the case of a displacement-controlled system, where the contact stiffness is small compared to the stiffness of the measuring system. It is shown that in this case the macroscopic coefficient of friction is a function of two dimensionless parameters—a dimensionless sliding velocity and dimensionless oscillation amplitude. In the limit of very large oscillation amplitudes, known solutions previously reported in the literature are reproduced. The region of small amplitudes is described for the first time in this paper."

abstract,"Abstract Effective lubrication under extreme conditions such as high temperature is of considerable importance to ensure the reliability of a mechanical system. New lubricants that can endure high temperatures should be studied and employed as alternatives to traditional oil-based lubricant. In this paper, a thermocapillary model of a silicone-oil droplet is developed by solving the Navier–Stokes and energy equations to obtain the flow, pressure, and temperature fields. This is accomplished using a conservative microfluidic two-phase flow level set method designed to track the interface between two immiscible fluids. The numerical simulation accuracy is examined by comparing the numerical results with experimental results obtained for a silicone-oil droplet. Hence, the movement and deformation of molten silicon droplets on graphite and corundum are numerically simulated. The results show that a temperature gradient causes a tension gradient on the droplet surface, which in turn creates a thermocapillary vortex. As the vortex develops, the droplet migrates to the low-temperature zone. In the initial stage, the molten silicon droplet on the corundum substrate forms two opposite vortex cells, whereas two pairs of opposite vortices are formed in the silicone fluid on the graphite substrate. Multiple vortex cells gradually develop into a single vortex cell, and the migration velocity tends to be stable. The greater the basal temperature gradient, the stronger the internal thermocapillary convection of the molten silicon droplet has, which yields higher speeds."

abstract,"Abstract We report the activation energy, ΔEa, for the quantum yield in thermally assisted photoelectron emission (TAPE) under 210-nm-wavelength light irradiation, and the associated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. Samples were cleaned only in acetone and scratched in air, water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, benzene, and cyclohexane. Glow curves, describing the temperature dependence of photoelectron emission (PE) quantum yield (emitted electrons/photon), Y, were obtained. A simple method of determining ΔEa using Y, called Y GC , at seven temperatures up to 353 °C, for the same Y glow curve, was proposed. The ΔEa obtained using this method was almost the same as that obtained from Y for seven stationary temperatures (Y ST ). For scratched samples, the TAPE was measured over two cycles of temperature increase and subsequent decrease (Up1, Down1 and Up2, Down2 scans) in the 25–339 °C range, and ΔEa was obtained from Y GC . The Arrhenius plot was approximated by a straight line, although a convex swelling peak appeared in the Up1 scan. ΔEaUp1 was in the 0.212–0.035 eV range, depending on the environment in which scratching was performed; ΔEaUp1 for water was much higher than that for acetone. This was explained in terms of the mode of the acid–base interaction between the liquid molecules and the hydroxyl group of Fe–OH. The values of ΔEaDown1, ΔEaUp1, and ΔEaDown2 were in the 0.038–0.012 eV range. The total count of electrons emitted during the Up1 and Up2 scans was found to decrease with increasing ΔEaDown1 and ΔEaDown2, respectively. ΔEaUp2 was found to increase with increasing presence of the FeO component in the analyzed Fe oxides. The convex swelling peak was attributed to the removal of carbon materials from the scratched surface and the effect of the increased electron density of the surface hydroxyl group of FeOH under the light irradiation."

abstract,"Abstract This paper investigates the self-loosening of threaded fasteners subjected to dynamic shear load. Three kinds of typical coatings, PTFE, MoS2, and TiN applied to bolts and nuts, are tested in this investigation. The study experimentally examines the loosening mechanisms of fasteners and assesses the anti-loosening performance of the three tested coatings based on their tightening characteristics, loosening curves, and the damage of thread surface. Additionally, the anti-loosening performance of the three coatings is compared under different load forms. The results indicate that the PTFE and MoS2 coatings have significant anti-loosening effect, whereas the anti-loosening performance of TiN coating is not satisfactory. It is also found that an appropriate increase of the initial tightening torque can significantly improve the anti-loosening effect. In addition, the microscopic analyses of PTFE and MoS2 coating reveal that a reduced initial tightening torque leads to fretting wear on the thread contact surfaces of fasteners, thereby aggravating the damage."

This paper reviews the development of stress-augmented thermal activation and its application to all of these areas of Tribology. The strengths and limitations of the approach are then discussed and future directions considered. From the scientific point of view, the concept of stress-augmented thermal activation is important since it enables the development of models that describe macroscale tribological performance, such as friction coefficient or tribofilm formation, in terms of the structure and behaviour of individual atoms and molecules. This both helps us understand these processes at a fundamental level and also provides tools for the informed design of lubricants and surfaces."

abstract,"Abstract We have investigated the sliding friction behavior of metallic couples with different enthalpy of mixing or reaction by friction force microscopy. Comparing the friction behavior of miscible and immiscible couples we find that in the first case friction is governed by adhesion while the shear strength is low (τ = 3–6 MPa). In the latter case of immiscible couples, adhesion is found to be low and the shear strength is large (τ ≈ 70 MPa). Statistical analysis of atomic stick-slip images recorded on an Au(111) surface with tips of different affinities with gold allows for a deeper understanding of our results. The periodicity of atomic stick-slip images corresponds to the interatomic distance of gold for immiscible counter-bodies. In contrast, for a reactive couple the periodicity of atomic stick-slip significantly differs from the gold interatomic distance and may correspond to the structural length of an ordered intermediate phase at the tip-surface interface."

abstract,"Abstract Friction experiments are conducted on a ring-on-disk tribometer, and friction noise produced during the friction process is extracted by a microphone. The phase trajectory and chaotic parameters of friction noise are obtained by phase-space reconstruction, and its attractor evolution is analyzed. The results indicate that the friction noise is chaotic because the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive. The phase trajectory of the friction noise follows a “convergence-stability-divergence” pattern during the friction process. The friction noise attractor begins forming in the running-in process, and the correlation dimension D increases gradually. In the stable process, the attractor remains steady, and D is stable. In the last step of the process, the attractor gradually disappears, and D decreases. The friction noise attractor is a chaotic attractor. Knowledge of the dynamic evolution of this attractor can help identify wear state changes from the running-in process to the steady and increasing friction processes."

abstract,"Abstract In recent years, a new 2D-layered material—black phosphorus (BP)—has been a rising star after the era of graphene owing to its high charge carrier mobility, tunable direct bandgap and unique in-plane anisotropic structure. With the development of the synthesis and modification methods of BP, its extensive applications, e.g., transistors, batteries and optoelectronics have emerged. In order to explore its full potential, research into the tribological properties of BP 2D-layered materials such as lubrication additives and fillers in self-lubricating composite materials would be not only of high scientific value but also of practical significance. In this work, recent advances on the friction and lubrication properties of BP nanosheets made by our group, including the micro-friction properties, the lubrication properties of BP nanosheets as water-based and oil-based lubrication additives, and the friction and wear of BP/PVDF composites will be presented. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities in the use of BP materials as lubricants will be discussed."

abstract,"Abstract Hypothesis on electrostatic attraction mechanisms involving the hairy adhesion of climbing animals has been a matter of controversy for several years. The detection of tribocharge and forces at attachment organs of animals is a practical method of clarifying the dispute with respect to electrostatic attraction in the attachment of animals. Nonetheless, the tribo-electrification is rarely examined in the contact-adhesion of animals (especially in their free and autonomous attachment) due to the lack of available devices. Therefore, the present study involves establishing a method and an apparatus that enables synchronous detection of tribocharge and contact forces to study tribo-electrification in the free locomotion of geckos. A type of a combined sensor unit that consists of a three-dimensional force transducer and a capacitor-based charge probe is used to measure contact forces and tribocharge with a magnitude corresponding to several nano-Coulombs at a footpad of geckos when they climb vertically upward on an acrylic oligomer substrate. The experimental results indicate that tribocharge at the footpads of geckos is related to contact forces and contact areas. The measured charge allows the expectation of an exact attraction with magnitude corresponding to dozens of newtons per square meter and provides a probability of examining tribo-electrification in animal attachment from a macro level."

abstract,"Abstract Coating is an effective way to reduce friction and wear and to improve the contact-fatigue lives of gear components, which further guarantees a longer service life and better reliability of industrial machinery. The fact that the influence coefficient linking the tractions and stress components could not be expressed explicitly increases the difficulty of coated solids contact analysis. The complicated tribological behavior between tooth surfaces influenced by lubrication and surface roughness further adds difficulty to the coated gear pair contact problems. A numerical elastohydrodynamic lubricated (EHL) contact model of a coated gear pair is proposed by considering the coupled effects of gear kinematics, coating properties, lubrication, and surface roughness. The frequency response function and the discrete convolute, fast Fourier transformation (DC-FFT) method are combined to calculate the surface deformation and the subsurface stress fields at each meshing position along the line of action (LOA). The Ree-Eyring fluid is assumed to incorporate the non-Newtonian effect, which is represented in the generalized Reynolds equation. Influences of the ratio between the Young’s modulus of the coating and the substrate on the contact performance, such as pressure, film thickness, tooth friction coefficient, and subsurface stress field, are studied. The effect of the root mean square (RMS) value of the tooth surface roughness is studied by introducing the roughness data, deterministically measured by an optical profiler."

Quite low steady friction coefficients (approximately of 0.02) of the irradiated WC-Ni were observed. The surface topographies and components were investigated. The quite low friction of the irradiated WC-Ni samples was ascribed to the higher fluid retention capability of the latter and the tribofilm formed during sliding."

abstract,"Abstract The so-called “green ship” is being regarded as a potential solution to the problems that the shipping industry faces, such as energy conservation and environmental protection. Some new features, such as integrated renewable energy application, biomimetic materials, and antifriction and wear resistant coating have been accepted as the typical characteristics of a green ship, but the tribology problems involved in these domains have not been precisely redefined yet. Further, the related research work is generally focused on the technology or material itself, but not on the integration of the applicable object or green ship, marine environment, and tribological systematical analysis from the viewpoint of the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) and ship energy efficiency management plan (SEEMP) improvements. Aiming at the tribology problems of the green ship, this paper reviews the research status of this issue from three specific domains, which are the tribology problems of the renewable energy system, tribological research for hull resistance reduction, and energy efficiency enhancement. Some typical tribological problems in the sail‐auxiliary system are discussed, along with the solar photovoltaic system and hull drag reduction in traditional marine mechanical equipment. Correspondingly, four domains that should be further considered for the future development target of the green ship are prospected."

abstract,"Abstract Rotary near-field lithography (RNFL) technology provides a route to overcome the diffraction limit with a high throughput and low cost for nanomanufacturing. Utilizing the advantage of the passive flying of a plasmonic head, RNFL can achieve a 10 m/s processing speed with a perfect near-field condition at dozens of nanometers. The flying performance of the plasmonic flying head (PFH) is the pivotal issue in the system. The linewidth has a strong correlation with the near-field gap, and the manufacturing uniformity is directly influenced by the dynamic performance. A more serious issue is that the unexpected contact between the PFH and substrate will result in system failure. Therefore, it is important to model and analyze the flying process of the PFH at the system level. In this study, a novel full-coupled suspension-PFH-air-substrate (SPAS) model that integrates a six-degree of freedom suspension-PFH dynamics, PFH-air-substrate air bearing lubrication, and substrate vibration, is established. The pressure distribution of the air bearing is governed by the molecular gas lubrication equation that is solved by the finite element method (FEM) with a local pressure gradient based adaptive mesh refinement algorithm using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. Based on this model, three designs of the air bearing surface are chosen to study the static, dynamic, and load/unload performance to verify whether it satisfies the design requirements of RNFL. Finally, a PFH analysis solver SKLY.app is developed based on the proposed model."

abstract,"Abstract To enhance the lubricating and extreme pressure (EP) performance of base oils, two types of oil-soluble ionic liquids (ILs) with similar anion albeit dissimilar cations were synthesized. The physical properties of the prepared ILs were measured. The anticorrosion properties of ILs were assessed by conducting corrosion tests on steel discs and copper strips, which revealed the remarkable anticorrosion properties of the ILs in comparison with those of the commercial additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). The tribological properties of the two ILs as additives for poly-α-olefin-10 (PAO10) with various mass concentrations were investigated. The tribological test results indicate that these ILs as additives are capable of reducing friction and wear of sliding contacts remarkably as well as enhance the EP performance of blank PAO10. Under similar test conditions, these IL additives exhibit higher lubricating and anti-wear (AW) performances than those of ZDDP based additive package in PAO10. Subsequently, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were conducted to study the lubricating mechanism of the two ILs. The results indicate that the formation of tribochemical film plays the most crucial role in enhancing the lubricating and AW behavior of the mixture lubricants."

abstract,"Abstract In this work, tribological characteristics of thin films composed of entangled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated. The surface roughness of CNT thin films fabricated via a dip-coating process was controlled by squeezing during the process with an applied normal force ranging from 0 to 5 kgf. Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the thin films were obtained to estimate the influence of the squeezing process on the crystallinity of the CNTs. The analysis revealed that squeezing could reduce surface roughness, while preserving the crystallinity of the CNTs. Moreover, the surface energy of the cover glass used to press the CNT thin film was found to be the critical factor controlling surface roughness. A micro-tribometer and macro-tribometer were used to assess the tribological characteristics of the CNT thin film. The results of the tribotest exhibited a correlation between the friction coefficient and surface roughness. Dramatic changes in friction coefficient could be observed in the micro-tribotest, while changes in friction coefficient in the macro-tribotest were not significant."

Using this rig, multi-type impact-sliding wear effects are realized and measured, such as those derived from unidirectional, reciprocating, and multi-mode combination motions. These three types of impact–sliding wear running behavior are tested and the wear damage mechanism is discussed."

The effects of the coating’s thermal and mechanical properties on the tribological performance are studied under the cold and warm engine operating conditions. Along with the increasing coating thickness, the effects of the coating’s thermal properties on friction loss are found to be significant, as well as the effects of the coating’s mechanical properties. It is also found that a soft coating with a lower thermal inertia has a greater ability to reduce the friction loss of the textured conjunction."

abstract,"Abstract N-doped ZnO thin films were deposited on 304L stainless steel through the pyrolysis of zinc acetate and ammonium acetate in different ratios at a temperature of 420 °C using metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Compositional and structural analyzes of the films were performed by using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The frictional behavior of the thin films and 304L stainless steel substrate was evaluated using a ball-on-flat configuration with reciprocating sliding under marginally lubricated and fully flooded conditions. Al alloy (2017) was used as ball counterface, while basestock synthetic polyalfaolefin oil (PAO10) without additives was used as lubricant. The flat and ball counterface surfaces were examined to assess the wear dimension and failure mechanism. Under marginally lubricated condition, N-doped ZnO thin films provided significant reduction in friction, whereas the films have minimal or no effect in friction under fully flooded condition. N-doped ZnO thin films showed a significant effect in protecting the ball counterface as wear volume was reduced compared with that of the substrate under the marginally lubricated condition. Under the fully flooded condition, with the exception of one of the films, the wear volume of the N-doped ZnO thin films ball reduced compared with that of the substrate. In all the ball counterfaces for N-doped ZnO thin films under both conditions, wear occurred through abrasive mechanism of various degrees or mild polishing. Thus, superfluous lubrication of N-doped ZnO thin films is not necessary to reduce friction and wear."

The surfaces that are polished by composite colloidal abrasives exhibit lower surface roughness (Ra) than those polished by pure colloidal silica abrasives. Furthermore, the acting mechanism of Ag-doped colloidal SiO2 composite abrasives in sapphire CMP is analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and analytical results show that element Ag forms Ag2O which acts as a catalyst to promote the chemical effect in CMP and leads to the increasing of MRR."

abstract,"Abstract The present study synthesized Cu–4 wt% Ni matrix composites reinforced with different percentages of TiC (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 wt%) through high-energy ball milling, followed by compaction and sintering. The friction and wear behavior was examined at four different normal loads of 5, 10, 15, and 20 N. A constant sliding speed of 1.25 m/s was maintained while sliding against a hardened counterface made of EN31 steel (HRC 60) under ambient conditions using a pin-on-disk test rig. The composite hardness increased until the addition of 4 wt% of TiC, beyond which it was observed to decrease. Such a trend may be attributed to the TiC agglomeration in the composites containing relatively larger amounts of TiC (i.e., 6 and 8 wt%). The wear rate linearly increased with the load. However, the composites exhibited a lower rate of wear than the matrix alloy, which may have resulted from the relatively higher hardness of composites. The observed friction and wear behavior has been explained on the basis of hardness and presence of the transfer layer on the worn surface and its nature, i.e., loose or well compacted. Addition of 4 wt% TiC showed the optimum performance in terms of friction and wear caused by its higher hardness and ability to hold a transfer layer of a relatively larger thickness compared to the other materials. The wear mechanism for the Cu4Ni matrix alloy was a mix of adhesive and oxidative wear and primarily abrasive for the composites containing hard TiC particles."

abstract,"Abstract Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and polyimide (PI) are two kinds of engineering polymer materials widely used as roller bearing cages and rings under extreme environment because of their noise reduction and corrosion resistance properties. The Si3N4 ceramic is the most common ball bearing material. Many current engineering applications of ball bearings require aqueous lubrication. Therefore, this study presents the aqueous lubrication of tribopairs formed by PEEK and PI material sliding against Si3N4 ceramic. Experimental results show that two tribopairs exhibited the similar tribological properties under the dry condition. Water as a lubricant for the PI–Si3N4 tribopair pairs effectively reduces both friction coefficients by 35.5% and wear rates by 32%. The water absorption of PI induces better tribological properties by changing the tribopair surface properties. In addition, the dimples appearing on the PI tribopair surface under water generate additional hydrodynamic lubrication and further improve the friction properties of surface. The PEEK–Si3N4 tribopair shows similar friction coefficients under two kinds of environments. The wear rates under water are approximately more than two times of that under dry sliding. However, water inhibits the appearance of the crush phenomenon and enhances the carrying capacity of the tribopair. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra demonstrate no chemical corrosion. The 3D profiler and SEM morphologies illustrate that the transfer film would be formed from the surface of PEEK under water but hindered under dry friction. Overall, the PI–Si3N4 tribopair exhibits better properties than PEEK under water and is promising for future applications in the bearing industry."

Microstructure and surface morphologies were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The results suggest that MMSA has the best wear resistance at 3.5 J and the worst wear resistance at 1.5 J. Furthermore, the wear mechanism and worn surface microstructure change with different impact energies.

abstract,"Abstract This study investigated the stick-slip characteristics of a magneto-rheological elastomer (MRE) against an aluminum plate. Herein, the MRE was manufactured, and a stick-slip tester was employed to evaluate the stick-slip performance of the MRE under different velocities and load conditions with and without a magnetic field. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the friction force of the stick-slip and the roughness of the aluminum plate surface were calculated to confirm the stick-slip phenomenon. After the tests, the wear surfaces were observed to evaluate the wear properties of the MRE regarding the stick-slip. Results  showed that the stick-slip was smaller at lower velocity. At higher velocity, the reduction of the stick-slip under a magnetic field was more clearly observed. Moreover, the wear reduced with reduced stick-slip under a magnetic field."

abstract,"Abstract Geckos’ ability to move on steep surfaces depends on their excellent adhesive structure, timely adjustments on locomotor behaviors, and elaborates control on reaction forces. However, it is still unclear how they can generate a sufficient driving force that is necessary for locomotion, while ensuring reliable adhesion on steep inclines. We measured the forces acting on each foot and recorded the contact states between feet and substrates when geckos encountered smooth inclination challenges ranging from 0° to 180°. The critical angles of the resultant force vectors of the front and hind-feet increased with respect to the incline angles. When the incline angle became greater than 120°, the critical angles of the front- and hind-feet were similar, and the averages of the critical angles of the front- and hind-feet were both smaller than 120°, indicating that the complicated and accurate synergy among toes endows gecko’s foot an obvious characteristic of “frictional adhesion” during locomotion. Additionally, we established a contact mechanical model for gecko’s foot in order to quantify the contribution of the frictional forces generated by the heel, and the adhesion forces generated by the toes on various inclines. The synergy between multiple contact mechanisms (friction or adhesion) is critical for the reliable attachment on an inclined surface, which is impossible to achieve by using a single-contact mechanism, thereby increasing the animal’s ability to adapt to its environment."

abstract,"Abstract In this work, the friction characteristics of single-layer MoS2 prepared with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at three different temperatures were quantitatively investigated and compared to those of single-layer MoS2 prepared using mechanical exfoliation. The surface and crystalline qualities of the MoS2 specimens were characterized using an optical microscope, atomic force microscope (AFM), and Raman spectroscopy. The surfaces of the MoS2 specimens were generally flat and smooth. However, the Raman data showed that the crystalline qualities of CVD-grown single-layer MoS2 at 800 °C and 850 °C were relatively similar to those of mechanically exfoliated MoS2 whereas the crystalline quality of the CVD-grown single-layer MoS2 at 900 °C was lower. The CVD-grown single-layer MoS2 exhibited higher friction than mechanically exfoliated single-layer MoS2, which might be related to the crystalline imperfections in the CVD-grown MoS2. In addition, the friction of CVD-grown single-layer MoS2 increased as the CVD growth temperature increased. In terms of tribological properties, 800 °C was the optimal temperature for the CVD process used in this work. Furthermore, it was observed that the friction at the grain boundary was significantly larger than that at the grain, potentially due to defects at the grain boundary. This result indicates that the temperature used during CVD should be optimized considering the grain size to achieve low friction characteristics. The outcomes of this work will be useful for understanding the intrinsic friction characteristics of single-layer MoS2 and elucidating the feasibility of single-layer MoS2 as protective or lubricant layers for micro- and nano-devices."

abstract,"Abstract In this experimental study, chromium oxide powder was sprayed on a low-carbon steel substrate using the atmospheric plasma spray process. The current and standoff distances (SODs) were varied to study their effect on the fracture toughness of the coatings. Theoretically, as the arc current increases, the melting of the ceramic oxide should increase and this in turn should lead to the formation of a dense coating. However, it was observed that if the arc power is too high and because the particle size of the powder is small (approximately 30 μm), the particles tend to fly away from the plasma core. Similarly, an appropriate SOD should provide the particles with more melting time, thus resulting in a dense coating. On the other hand, a larger SOD leads to the solidification of the molten particles before the droplets can reach the substrate. All these effects may lead to substantial variation in the fracture toughness of the coating. The present paper attempts to correlate the plasma spraying parameters and microstructure of the coating with the fracture toughness and other primary coating properties."

abstract,"Abstract A finite element analysis is used to study the elastic-plastic contact of a coated sphere compressed by a rigid flat under the stick contact condition. This was done for a wide range of hard coating material properties and coating thicknesses. A comparison with the slip contact condition is presented in terms of the critical contact parameters (at yield inception) and plasticity evolution. Empirical expressions are provided for critical interferences of the first and second yield inceptions, in the coating and on the substrate side of the interface, respectively. An expression is also provided for the dimensionless coating thickness for optimal resistance to plasticity under the stick contact condition. Additionally, the relations between different contact parameters in the elastic-plastic regime are presented. In general, it was found that the contact condition has a negligible effect on the contact parameters, except for phenomena occurring close to the contact area."

abstract,"Abstract Friction, wear, and contact fatigue are the main causes of energy loss, material waste, and equipment failure. The aim of remanufacturing is to repair and modify the damaged equipment surface, and the surface coating is the major material that allows the remanufactured parts to be used in a new round of operation. Thus, the design and preparation of surface coatings are very important to repair, strengthen, or modify the friction pairs, in order to ensure long-term operation of the remanufactured parts. Recently, a lot of research on designing and preparing friction pair surface modification coatings has been conducted by the National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing (NKLR). The research conducted achieved the following goals: the mechanism of micro/nano multilayer surface modification coatings with long-term efficacy life was revealed, and the corresponding design considerations and preparation methods of nanocrystalline micro tribological coatings were innovatively developed. A series of new “two-step” processes to prepare sulfide solid lubricating coatings were developed. The competitive failure mechanism of the surface coating in simultaneous wear and fatigue conditions was revealed, and some composite coatings with dual properties of wear resistance and fatigue resistance were prepared. Based on the stress distribution of friction surface contact areas and the piezoelectric effect, a failure warning intelligent coating is designed and developed. These coatings have been successfully applied to critical friction components, such as the spindle of large centrifugal compressors, engine cylinder piston components, and driver gear pairs."

abstract,"Abstract Movement between contacting surfaces ranges from macro to micro scales, from the movement of continental plates and glaciers to the locomotion of animals and insects. Surface topographies, lubricant layers, contaminants, operating conditions, and others control it, i.e., this movement depends on the tribological characteristics of a system. Before the industrial revolution, friction and wear were controlled by the application of animal fat or oil. During the industrial revolution, with the introduction of trains and other machinery, the operating conditions at the contacting surfaces changed dramatically. New bearings were designed and built and simple lubrication measures were no longer satisfactory. It became critical to understand the lubrication mechanisms involved. During that period, solid theoretical foundations, leading to the development of new technologies, were laid. The field of tribology had gained a significant prominence, i.e., it became clear that without advancements in tribology the technological progress would be limited. It was no longer necessary to build oversized ship bearings hoping that they would work. The ship or automobile bearings could now be optimized and their behavior predicted. By the middle of the 20th century, lubrication mechanisms in non-conformal contacts, i.e., in gears, rolling contact bearings, cams and tappets, etc., were also finally understood.Today, we face new challenges such as sustainability, climate change and gradual degradation of the environment. Problems of providing enough food, clean water and sufficient energy to the human population to pursue a civilized life still remain largely unsolved. These challenges require new solutions and innovative approaches. As the humanity progresses, tribology continue to make vital contributions in addressing the demands for advanced technological developments, resulting in, for example, reducing the fuel consumption and greenhouse gases emission, increasing machine durability and improving the quality of life through artificial implants, among the others."

The models are based on the Maugis–Dugdale approximation in normal and frictional (sliding and rolling) contacts of elastic bodies with regular surface relief. For the normal adhesive contact of surfaces with regular relief, an analytical solution, which takes into account the mutual effect of asperities, is presented. The contribution of adhesive hysteresis into the sliding and rolling friction forces is calculated for various values of nominal pressure, parameters of microgeometry, and adhesion."

abstract,"Abstract Friction and wear phenomena encountered in mechanical systems with moving components are directly related to efficiency, reliability and life of the system. Hence, minimizing and controlling these phenomena to achieve the desired system performance is crucial. Among the numerous strategies developed for reducing friction and wear, coatings have been successfully utilized in various engineering applications to mitigate tribological problems. One of the benefits of coatings is that they may be fabricated using a variety of materials in several different forms and structures to satisfy the requirements of the operating conditions. Among many types, coatings that are comprised of a combination of materials in the form of a multilayer have been gaining much interest due to the added degree of freedom in tailoring the coating property. In this paper, the properties and development status of multilayer coating systems for tribological applications were reviewed with the aim to gain a better understanding regarding their advantages and limitations. Specifically, focus was given to Ti-based and Cr-based coatings since Ti and Cr were identified as important elements in multilayer coating applications. Emphasis was given to materials, design concepts, mechanical properties, deposition method, and friction and wear characteristics of these types of coatings."

abstract,"Abstract The strength of an adhesive contact between two bodies can strongly depend on the macroscopic and microscopic shape of the surfaces. In the past, the influence of roughness has been investigated thoroughly. However, even in the presence of perfectly smooth surfaces, geometry can come into play in form of the macroscopic shape of the contacting region. Here we present numerical and experimental results for contacts of rigid punches with flat but oddly shaped face contacting a soft, adhesive counterpart. When it is carefully pulled off, we find that in contrast to circular shapes, detachment occurs not instantaneously but detachment fronts start at pointed corners and travel inwards, until the final configuration is reached which for macroscopically isotropic shapes is almost circular. For elongated indenters, the final shape resembles the original one with rounded corners. We describe the influence of the shape of the stamp both experimentally and numerically.Numerical simulations are performed using a new formulation of the boundary element method for simulation of adhesive contacts suggested by Pohrt and Popov. It is based on a local, mesh dependent detachment criterion which is derived from the Griffith principle of balance of released elastic energy and the work of adhesion. The validation of the suggested method is made both by comparison with known analytical solutions and with experiments. The method is applied for simulating the detachment of flat-ended indenters with square, triangle or rectangular shape of cross-section as well as shapes with various kinds of faults and to “brushes”. The method is extended for describing power-law gradient media."

abstract,"Abstract Calculations of the impact of friction and wear on energy consumption, economic expenditure, and CO2 emissions are presented on a global scale. This impact study covers the four main energy consuming sectors: transportation, manufacturing, power generation, and residential. Previously published four case studies on passenger cars, trucks and buses, paper machines and the mining industry were included in our detailed calculations as reference data in our current analyses. The following can be concluded:
 In total, ~23% (119 EJ) of the world’s total energy consumption originates from tribological contacts. Of that 20% (103 EJ) is used to overcome friction and 3% (16 EJ) is used to remanufacture worn parts and spare equipment due to wear and wear-related failures.  By taking advantage of the new surface, materials, and lubrication technologies for friction reduction and wear protection in vehicles, machinery and other equipment worldwide, energy losses due to friction and wear could potentially be reduced by 40% in the long term (15 years)and by 18% in the short term (8 years). On global scale, these savings would amount to 1.4% of the GDP annually and 8.7% of the total energy consumption in the long term.  The largest short term energy savings are envisioned in transportation (25%) and in the power generation (20%) while the potential savings in the manufacturing and residential sectors are estimated to be ~10%. In the longer terms, the savings would be 55%, 40%, 25%, and 20%, respectively.  Implementing advanced tribological technologies can also reduce the CO2 emissions globally by as much as 1,460 MtCO2 and result in 450,000 million Euros cost savings in the short term. In the longer term, the reduction can be 3,140 MtCO2 and the cost savings 970,000 million Euros.  Fifty years ago, wear and wear-related failures were a major concern for UK industry and their mitigation was considered to be the major contributor to potential economic savings by as much as 95% in ten years by the development and deployment of new tribological solutions. The corresponding estimated savings are today still of the same orders but the calculated contribution to cost reduction is about 74% by friction reduction and to 26% from better wear protection. Overall, wear appears to be more critical than friction as it may result in catastrophic failures and operational breakdowns that can adversely impact productivity and hence cost."

abstract,"Abstract This work is a review of previous works, presenting and discussing the most important results obtained by an ongoing research program towards the development of innovative, low-cost, self-lubricating composites with a low friction coefficient and high mechanical strength and wear resistance. Special emphasis is given to uniaxial die pressing of solid lubricant particles mixed with matrix powders and to metal injection moulding associated with in situ generation of solid lubricant particles. Initially, a microstructural model/processing route (powder injection moulding followed by plasma-assisted debinding and sintering) produced a homogeneous dispersion of in situ generated solid lubricant particles. Micrometric nodules of graphite with diameter smaller than 20 μm were formed, constituting a nanostructured stacking of graphite foils with nanometric thickness. Micro Raman analysis indicated that the graphite nodules were composed of turbostratic 2D graphite having highly misaligned graphene planes separated by large interlamellae distance. Large interplanar distance between the graphene foils and misalignment of these foils were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and were, probably, the origin of the outstandingly low dry friction coefficient (0.04). The effect of sintering temperature, precursor content, metallic matrix composition and surface finish is also reported. Furthermore, the influence of a double-pressing/double-sintering (DPDS) technique on the tribological performance of self-lubricating uniaxially die-pressed hBN + graphite-Fe-Si-C-Mo composite is also investigated. Moreover, the tribological behaviour of die-pressed Fe-Si-C matrix composites containing 5, 7.5 and 10 wt% solid lubricants (hBN and graphite) added during the mixing step is analysed in terms of mechanical properties and wear mechanisms. Finally, the synergy between solid lubricant particles dispersed in a metallic matrix and fluid lubricants in a cooperative mixed lubrication regime is presented."

abstract,"Abstract The prediction and optimization of surface roughness values remain a critical concern in nano-fluids based minimum quantity lubrication (NFMQL) turning of titanium (grade-2) alloys. Here, we discuss an application of response surface methodology with Box–Cox transformation to determine the optimal cutting parameters for three surface roughness values, i.e., R a, R q, and R z, in turning of titanium alloy under the NFMQL condition. The surface roughness prediction model has been established based on the selected input parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, approach angle, and different nano-fluids used. Then the multiple regression technique is used to find the relationship between the given responses and input parameter. Further, the experimental data were optimized through the desirability function approach. The findings from the current investigation showed that feed rate is the most effective parameter followed by cutting speed, different nano-fluids, and approach angle on R a and R q values, whereas cutting speed is more effective in the case of R z under NFMQL conditions. Moreover, the predicted results are comparatively near to the experimental values and hence, the established models of RSM using Box-Cox transformation can be used for prediction satisfactorily."

abstract,"Abstract Tactile perception is a complex system, which depends on frictional interactions between skin and counter-body. The contact mechanics of tactile friction is governed by many factors such as the state and properties of skin and counter-body. In order to discover the connection between perception and tactile friction on textured stainless steel sheets, both perception experiments (subjective) and tactile friction measurements (objective) were performed in this research. The perception experiments were carried out by using a panel test method to identify the perceived roughness, perceived stickiness and comfort level from the participants. For the friction experiments, tactile friction was measured by a multi-axis force/torque transducer in vivo. The perceived stickiness was illustrated as an effective subjective stimulus, which has a negative correlation to the comfort perception. No significant evidence was revealed to the connection between the perceived roughness and comfort perception, and this relationship may be influenced by the participants’ individual experience, gender and moisture level of skin. Furthermore, the kinetic tactile friction was concluded as an objective stimulus to the comfort perception with a negative correlation."

abstract,"Abstract The influence of out-of-plane oscillations on friction is a well-known phenomenon that has been studied extensively with various experimental methods, e.g., pin-on-disk tribometers. However, existing theoretical models have yet achieved only qualitative correspondence with experiment. Here we argue that this may be due to the system dynamics (mass and tangential stiffness) of the pin or other system components being neglected. This paper builds on the results of a previous study [19] by taking the stiffness and resulting dynamics of the system into account. The main governing parameters determining macroscopic friction, including a dimensionless oscillation amplitude, a dimensionless sliding velocity and the relation between three characteristic frequencies (that of externally excited oscillation and two natural oscillation frequencies associated with the contact stiffness and the system stiffness) are identified. In the limiting cases of a very soft system and a very stiff system, our results reproduce the results of previous studies. In between these two limiting cases there is also a resonant case, which is studied here for the first time. The resonant case is notable in that it lacks a critical sliding velocity, above which oscillations no longer reduce friction. Results  obtained for the resonant case are qualitatively supported by experiments."

The emphasize of this review paper is on the algorithms and studies, which are more popular and have been repeated several times. The focus has been divided into two main groups: experiment-based and model-based approaches. Each of these main groups has several sub-categories, which are explained in the next few sections.

Filler addition greatly enhances the tribological properties of the epoxy resin, by reducing the friction coefficient and the wear rate. In addition, it was found that the treated carbon nanotubes/epoxy composites have the best tribological behavior. Moreover, a correlation between contact temperature and friction coefficient is reported. Finally, the wear mechanisms were determined by scanning electronic microscopy."

The effect of the weight percentage of graphite content on the dry sliding wear behavior of cotton fiber polyester composite (CFPC) was examined by considering the effect of operating parameters like load, speed, and sliding distance. The wear test results showed the inclusion of 5 wt.% of graphite as fillers in CFPC increase wear resistance compared to 3 wt.% of graphite fillers. The graphite fillers were recommended for CFPC to increase the wear resistance of the material. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the wear mechanism. To predict the wear behavior of the composite material, comparisons were made between the general regression technique and an artificial neural network (ANN). The conformation test results revealed the predicted wear with the ANN was acceptable when compared with the actual experimental results and the regression mathematical models."

The results indicate that carbon nanotubes can considerably improve the tribological performance of a piston ring and cylinder liner system under dry sliding conditions, whereas improvement under lubricated conditions is not obvious. Under dry friction, the effective time of the CNTs is limited and the friction coefficient decreases with an increase in CNT content. Furthermore, the dominant wear mechanism during dry friction is adhesive."

In the present study, because of the significant effect of the plateau component on tribological behavior such as asperity contact, wear and friction, a truncated separation method is proposed based on the truncation of the upper Gaussian component defined by zero skewness. The three separation methods are applied to real worn surfaces. Surface-separation and surface-reconstruction results show that the truncated method accurately captures the upper component identically to the ISO and continuous ones. The identification of the lower component characteristics requires performing a curve fit procedure on the data left after truncation. However, the truncated method fails in identifying the upper component when the material ratio of the transition is less than 9%."

abstract,"Abstract The present paper is devoted to a theoretical analysis of sliding friction under the influence of oscillations perpendicular to the sliding plane. In contrast to previous works we analyze the influence of the stiffness of the tribological contact in detail and also consider the case of large oscillation amplitudes at which the contact is lost during a part of the oscillation period, so that the sample starts to “jump”. It is shown that the macroscopic coefficient of friction is a function of only two dimensionless parameters—a dimensionless sliding velocity and dimensionless oscillation amplitude. This function in turn depends on the shape of the contacting bodies. In the present paper, analysis is carried out for two shapes: a flat cylindrical punch and a parabolic shape. Here we consider “stiff systems”, where the contact stiffness is small compared with the stiffness of the system. The role of the system stiffness will be studied in more detail in a separate paper."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, the material removal mechanism of copper chemical mechanical polishing was studied by the quasicontinuum method that integrated molecular dynamics and the finite element method. By analyzing the abrasive process of different particle sizes on single crystal copper, we investigated the internal material deformation, the formation of chips, the stress distribution, and the change of cutting force. Results  showed that shear band deformation was generated along the cutting direction at approximately 45° inside the workpiece material. The deformation was accompanied by dislocations and sliding phenomena in the shear band region. Smaller abrasive particle size led to poor quality of the workpiece, while a larger particle size led to better quality. However, larger particle size resulted in greater plastic deformation and deeper residual stress inside the workpiece. Size change of abrasive particles had little effect on the tangential cutting force."

abstract,"Abstract A three-dimensional (3D) scratch model is proposed to investigate the effects of yield strength of both coatings and substrates. With the help of combined Coulomb and plastic friction, the obtained results comprehensively interpret the experimental phenomena in most metals that with the growth of hardness after heat treatment the scratch friction coefficient (SFC) increases. This interpretation could not be done before. Scratch tests on the surface with or without the coating are discussed. Without the coating the SFC increases due to the decrease of the area with plastic slippage and/or the increase of friction stress during the increase of the yield strength in the material. With a softer substrate the friction stress decreases but the SFC increases, which is caused by the growth of the entire contact area and surface deformation. Conversely, with a stronger substrate the SFC decreases due to an intensified plastic slippage. The obtained results pave a new way to understanding the effects of yield strength on scratch tests, interpret experimental phenomena, and should be helpful for an optimum design in experiments."

abstract,"Abstract Lamellar compounds such as the disulfides of molybdenum and tungsten are widely used as additives in lubricant oils or as solid lubricants in aerospace industries. The dioxides of these two transition metals have identical microstructures with those of the disulfides. The differences in the lubrication behaviors of disulfide and dioxides were investigated theoretically. Tungsten dioxide and molybdenum dioxide exhibit higher bond strengths at the interface and lower interlayer interactions than those of the disulfides which indicates their superlubricity. Furthermore, the topography of the electron density of the single layer nanostructure determined their sliding potential barrier; the dioxides showed a weaker electronic cloud distribution between the two neighboring oxygen atoms, which facilitated the oxygen atoms of the counterpart to go through. For commensurate friction, the dioxides exhibited nearly the same value of friction work, and same was the case for the disulfides. The lower positive value of friction work for the dioxides confirmed their improved lubricity than the disulfides and the higher mechanical strength of the bulk dioxides demonstrated that they are excellent solid lubricants in vacuum."

abstract,"Abstract Cryogenic treatment (CT) is a relatively new field, which has emerged during the last three decades of the twentieth century. However, its impact on material shaping and making tool life, and enhancement of their mechanical properties are quite remarkable. The selection of appropriate process parameters for CT is essential for cost reduction and optimum productivity. This study focuses on the influence of key parameters of CT cycles (i.e., soaking temperature and duration) on the friction and wear behavior of AISI H13 hot die steel under dry sliding conditions against hardened and tempered AISI D3 cold work tool steel (counter face) at varying sliding speeds and loads. Mathematical models have been developed for wear rate, the average coefficient of friction, and maximum contact temperature using the Box-Cox methodology. The developed mathematical models have been validated by comparing with the experimental results. Moreover, the optimum values of the process parameter have been employed to maximize the output and validate the same by confirmation of the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the modeling and optimization of sliding friction and wear characteristics of AISI H13 under varied CT cycles."

abstract,"Abstract The correlation between the wear behavior of a heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) brake liner tested under controlled laboratory conditions and that in actual field conditions is investigated. A brake liner study for friction and wear is performed on an inertia brake dynamometer (IBD) at different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) using 6000 brake actuations in a laboratory. The total wear loss of the brake liner at three different temperatures for 6000 brake actuations in IBD is found to be 1.12 mm. The actual field test is conducted on four different HCVs, namely, a city bus (CB), a high speed bus (HSB), a highway truck (HWT), and a tipper lorry (TL). These HCVs run at different terrain/traffic conditions and load conditions. When comparing the predicted life of the brake liner through the IBD test with the actual life of the brake liner in different HCVs, a vast difference is observed. Due to the large variation of liner life observed between the actual and predicted tests, an extensive field test is conducted. In the field test, the liner with identical formulation is fitted in the four types of HCVs. The predicted life of the liner using IBD is then correlated with the field test observation and a correlation factor is determined. Based on this correlation factor, the predicted life of the liner and the achieved life on the HCV are found to be fairly close. This study will be useful to design the friction material formulation and to predict the actual life of the brake liner for various HCVs."

The results indicated that structure and surface topography of the surgical suture had a pronounced effect on the tribological interactions. The apparent coefficient of friction of vicryl surgical suture was the smallest among the three surgical suture materials. As the sliding velocity increased, or the applied load decreased, the coefficient of friction increased. Furthermore, stick-slip phenomena were observed during the sliding procedure."

abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a comprehensive review of friction modelling to provide an understanding of design for durability within interacting systems. Friction is a complex phenomenon and occurs at the interface of two components in relative motion. Over the last several decades, the effects of friction and its modelling techniques have been of significant interests in terms of industrial applications. There is however a need to develop a unified mathematical model for friction to inform design for durability within the context of varying operational conditions. Classical dynamic mechanisms model for the design of control systems has not incorporated friction phenomena due to non-linearity behaviour. Therefore, the tribological performance concurrently with the joint dynamics of a manipulator joint applied in hazardous environments needs to be fully analysed. Previously the dynamics and impact models used in mechanical joints with clearance have also been examined. The inclusion of reliability and durability during the design phase is very important for manipulators which are deployed in harsh environmental and operational conditions. The revolute joint is susceptible to failures such as in heavy manipulators these revolute joints can be represented by lubricated conformal sliding surfaces. The presence of pollutants such as debris and corrosive constituents has the potential to alter the contacting surfaces, would in turn affect the performance of revolute joints, and puts both reliability and durability of the systems at greater risks of failure. Key literature is identified and a review on the latest developments of the science of friction modelling is presented here. This review is based on a large volume of knowledge. Gaps in the relevant field have been identified to capitalise on for future developments. Therefore, this review will bring significant benefits to researchers, academics and industry professionals."

abstract,Abstract Thermally grown surface oxide layers dominate the single-asperity tribological behavior of a Zr60Cu30Al10 glass. Increase in oxidation time leads to an increased contribution of shearing and a corresponding decreased contribution of ploughing to friction. This change in the dominating friction and wear mechanism results in an overall minor decrease of the friction coefficient of oxidized surfaces compared to the metallic glass sample with native surface oxide. Our results demonstrate the importance of creating a stable oxide layer for practical applications of metallic glasses in micro-devices involving sliding contact.

abstract,"Abstract Thin film and elastohydrodynamic lubrication regimes are rather young domains of tribology and they are still facing unresolved issues. As they rely upon a full separation of the moving surfaces by a thin (or very thin) fluid film, the knowledge of its thickness is of paramount importance, as for instance to developing lubricated mechanisms with long lasting and efficient designs. As a consequence, a large collection of formulae for point contacts have been proposed in the last 40 years. However, their accuracy and validity have rarely been investigated. The purpose of this paper is to offer an evaluation of the most widespread analytical formulae and to define whether they can be used as qualitative or quantitative predictions. The methodology is based on comparisons with a numerical model for two configurations, circular and elliptical, considering both central and minimum film thicknesses."

abstract,"Abstract The stability of the tribological properties of polymer coatings is vital to ensure their long term use. The superlubricity of the poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVPA)-modified Ti6Al4V/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) interface can be obtained when lubricated by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.2), but not when lubricated by deionized water and ethanol. Therefore, the mechanisms for the superlubricity of PVPA coatings affected by lubricant were investigated in detail. The stability of the PVPA coatings and their compatibility with the lubricant are critical factors in realizing ideal tribological properties of PVPA coatings. Robust PVPA coatings are stable under a wide range of pH values (6–10) using PBS as the basic solution, and are also characterized by superlubricity. The hydrolysis kinetics of phosphate anhydride is the main reason for the pH responses. In addition, along with stability, PVPA coatings exhibit different friction coefficients in salt solutions which are composed of various ions, which indicates that the compatibility between PVPA coatings and the lubricant can be used to regulate the superlubricity properties. Based on a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of surperlubricity by considering the effects of the lubricant, PVPA coatings with stability and perfect tribological performance are expected to be applied in more aspects."

Therefore, an effective interfacial parameter that is well correlated with the lubrication effect is of practical significance. This paper presents an examination of common interfacial parameters, including surface tension, contact angle, contact angle hysteresis, and a recently proposed spreading parameter. Specimen surfaces of different hydro/oleophobicity were prepared and characterized using the aforementioned interfacial parameters. These samples were further used as bearing surfaces in hydrodynamic lubrication tests. The correlations of these parameters with the measured lubricating film thickness were examined and compared. The key parameter closely related to the hydrodynamic effect was identified."

The approach considers the variation of mixed lubrication and variable lubricant viscosity with temperature along the engine stroke, is developed to optimize the profile of a piston ring. A piston ring profile is represented by a polynomial function. A case study of the second piston ring shows that the proposed method can be applied for the optimization of a piston ring profile. In addition, this paper illustrates the effects of the degree of a polynomial function. The results show that the minimization of friction and maximization of oil film load-carrying capacity can be balanced simultaneously when the degree of the polynomial is 2 and 5."

In contrast to the contacts in a rolling bearing, in which the lubricant in the oil reservoir distributes symmetrically, ball-on-disc contact shows asymmetry of lubricant distribution due to centrifugal effects. In order to closely imitate the contact occurring between the ball and the outer ring of a ball bearing, this study proposes an experimental model based on ball-on-glass ring contact. An optical matrix method is used to analyze the optical system, which is composed of a steel ball-lubricant-chromium-coated glass ring. Based on the optical analysis, the measurement system is improved in order to obtain a high quality interference image, which makes it possible to measure the film thickness at high-speeds conditions."

It is shown that major part of present experiments can be explained by a single speed profile known as a plug flow. This finding is in contradiction to usual linear speed profile predicted by Reynolds equation."

Influences of oil droplet size, viscosity, and surface tension on droplet spreading were examined. Lubricating film formation was also investigated when droplets traveled through the EHL contact region. The results indicated that droplet size and running speed significantly influenced film profiles. With increasing entrainment speeds, a small droplet passed through the contact without spreading and generated films with a significant depression in the central contact region."

However, the replenishment process was slow because of the presence of grease fingers along the track and thickener-deposited film inside the track. The contact angles of base oil on the chromium-coated surface and thickener-deposited surfaces were measured. Results  proved that the contact angle on the deposited film remarkably increased compared with that on the chromium-coated surface from 25° to more than 40°.

In some cases, these disadvantages may lead the contacting surfaces to failure before the expected lifetime. In this work, mathematical models of the friction clutch system (single-disc clutch) were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement). Analysis has been completed using developed axisymmetric models to simulate the friction clutch system during the engagement. The surface temperatures are found based on uniform pressure and uniform wear assumptions."

Theoretical results indicate that (a) tricresol phosphate additive is not suited for addition to 1,3,4-tri-(2-octyldodecyl) cyclopentane lubricant due to limited compatibility; (b) tri-(2-octyldodecyl) phosphate is an excellent lubricant additive due to its perfect compatibility, ease of forming a shear film on the surface of friction pairs, higher strength, and low energy dissipation; and (c) lubrication occurs through the solid-liquid composite lubrication mechanism. These theoretical results were confirmed experimentally."

Four different groove orientations forming the surface topographies—smooth surface, 0°, 45° and 90°—were manufactured by grinding and compared. All friction tests with different surface topographies were conducted using an alternative tribometer simulating the pure sliding process in the wheel-rail contact. The Hertzian pressure was maintained at 1,000 MPa with two levels of sliding velocity (20 mm/s and 80 mm/s). This study resulted in five main findings.First, the initial surface topographies seemed to have a significant effect on the friction coefficient independently of the speed. Second, the increase of the sliding velocity would decrease the friction coefficient. Third, especially when accompanied with a high sliding velocity, an initial rough surface would have a significant effect on the wear of the wheel. Fourth, the highest wear values were observed at groove orientations of 45° when accompanied with a high sliding velocity. Finally, the break-in duration seemed to depend on the initial surface topographies of the rail and the sliding velocity."

To characterize the tribological properties of TBCs, a better understanding of their failure mechanisms and a thorough investigation of their performance are required. In this research, we used Taguchi-based grey relational analysis (GRA) to optimize the process parameters of various tribological characteristics of ceramic coatings applied via an atmospheric plasma spray process. Using Taguchi L16 factorial mixed-level experimental design, we also evaluated tribological characteristics such as wear loss and the coefficient of friction. Using GRA, we successfully performed a multiple output optimization and ranking of the control factors. Based on ANOVA results, we evaluated the significance of each process parameter and validated our findings in tests using the obtained optimum set of process parameters. Our study results will help to minimize wear loss and the coefficient of friction and to maximize TBC life."

A large difference of more than 20% is found between the equations for a lateral force of spool valve with many grooves. It was found that the Reynolds equation is not suitable for calculation of a lateral force of the spool valve with multiple-grooves of which the width and depth are even larger than the clearance under cavitation."

abstract,"Abstract Understanding the wetting behavior of nanostructures is important for surface design. The present study examined the intrinsic wettability of nanopore structures, and proposed a theoretical wetting model. Using this model, it was found that the wetting behavior of nanopore structures depends on the morphology of a surface. To accurately predict the wetting behavior of nanopore structures, correction factors were introduced. As a result, the proposed wetting model can be used to predict the wettability of nanopore structures for various engineering purposes."

abstract,"Abstract Improvement in surface properties and retainment of bulk properties are essential requirements for the design of components for wear resistance applications. This paper summarizes various features of Al/SiC/Gr hybrid composites that can be employed in different tribological applications. The study has revealed that the processing route plays a significant role in obtaining a homogeneous structure of these composites. In powder metallurgy, the selection of sizes of the matrix and reinforcement powders is crucial, whereas the wettability between the reinforcement particles and molten alloy is a major challenge in liquid metallurgy. The incorporation of SiC particles increases the mechanical strength and wear performance of Al composites. However, ejection of these particles can reduce the wear performance of Al composites under severe conditions. The addition of Gr particles helps in the formation of a thick and extensive tribolayer on the wear surface. This layer reduces direct contact between the rubbing surfaces, thereby decreasing the wear rate under certain conditions. Morphological analysis of worn surfaces has confirmed that the hybrid composites exhibit superior wear properties than the pure Al alloy and the ceramic-reinforced composite. However, increase in the Gr content beyond a limiting value can deteriorate the tribological properties of these composites. Therefore, true optimization of a tribosystem (of the hybrid composite and counterface) can be achieved by selecting appropriate reinforcement contents."

abstract,"Abstract In this work, we developed a finite element modeling approach to study adhesion during unidirectional contact between a two-dimensional plane-strain square and a flat slab. The surfaces were metallic or ceramic, and we analyzed different pairs of materials and their adhesion intensity using a FORTRAN subroutine (DLOAD) connected to a commercial finite element code Abaqus, which provided the surface attractive forces based on the Lennard-Jones interatomic potential using Hamaker constants. We considered adhesive loads during both the approach and separation of the surfaces. During the separation step, we modeled the material transfer between surfaces due to adhesion with respect to damage initiation and propagation at the flat slab. The parameters considered in the simulations include normal load, chemical affinity, and system size, and we analyzed different conditions by comparing the interaction forces during approach and withdrawal. This work also presents: (i) a description of the evolution of energy dissipation due to adhesion hysteresis, (ii) the formation–growth–breakage process of the adhesive junctions and the material transfer between surfaces, and (iii) an adhesive wear map based on a proposed novel equation that correlates the material parameters and material loss due to adhesion. The results indicate that the chemical affinity between bodies in contact is more related to adhesion than the applied load. In addition, the ratio between the material strength and elastic modulus seems to be an important factor in reducing adhesive wear."

abstract,"Abstract A textured surface with a micro-groove structure exerts a distinct characteristic on drag reduction behavior. The fluid dynamic models of four textured surfaces are constructed in various profile geometries. Computational fluid dynamics is used to study the friction factors and drag reduction properties with various flow speeds on the textured surfaces. The friction coefficient varieties in the interface between the fluid and the textured surface are examined according to the simulation of the four geometries with V-shaped, saw tooth, rectangular, and semi-circular sections. The drag reduction efficiencies decrease with the increase in water velocity while it is less than a certain value. Moreover, the simulation results of the velocity, shear stress, energy, and turbulence effect on the V-shaped groove surface are presented in comparison with those of the smooth surface to illustrate the drag reduction mechanism. The results indicate that the peaks of the V-shaped grooves inhibit the lateral movement of the turbulent flow and generate the secondary vortex, which plays a key role in the impeding momentum exchange, thereby decreasing turbulent bursting intensity and reducing shear stress in the near-wall flow field. The kinetic energy and turbulence analysis shows that the vortex in the near-wall flow field on the textured surface is more stable compared to that on the smooth surface."

The three different brake pad materials studied are flax fiber reinforced phenolic composites (FFRC), basalt fiber reinforced phenolic composites (BFRC), and flax/basalt reinforced hybrid phenolic composites (HFRC). A wear mechanism map was developed by using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm method (FCM) to study the wear mechanism of composites. The results showed BFRC to be a better brake pad material than the other fiber reinforced composites studied, because the good thermal characteristics and bonding nature of basalt fiber increased the wear resistance of BFRC considerably."

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of purchased UHMWPE powders was performed. The enthalpy changed with an increase in MW. UH300 had the lowest temperature of an extrapolated peak and the best peak symmetry in DSC analysis. The friction coefficient curves of molded pure and modified UHMWPEs/Ti6Al4V were compared, and the volume loss by the wear of polymers was measured. 3D topographies of the worn surfaces of polymers and images of the worn surfaces of polymers and titanium alloy against polymers were analyzed by confocal white light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Results  showed that the influence of MW of UHMWPE was obvious on the friction and wear characteristics of pure UHMWPEs and 15% add1 UHMWPEs. An MW of 3 million was the best to reduce the friction of rubbing pairs, enhance the wear resistance of pure UHMWPEs and 15% add1-UHMWPEs, and improve the mating properties of Ti6Al4V."

Two-dimensional (2D) BRNN–QSTR models can flexibly and easily estimate lubricant-additive antiwear properties.

abstract,"Abstract The tribological behaviors of two types of seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti–6Al–4V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed rubbing test. The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the seal couple, the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti–6Al–4V seal couple, the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti–6Al–4V blade was faster than that of the Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti–6Al–4V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti–6Al–4V seal couple, the TRR of the Ti–6Al–4V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two seal couples used in this study."

Three different mechanical models for the material removal in the CMP process, i.e., abrasive wear, adhesive wear, and erosive wear are investigated, with a focus on the comparison of the results for different models. The conclusions and methods obtained could potentially contribute to the understanding and evaluation of the CMP process in further work."

abstract,"Abstract The friction coefficient, wear rate, and wear coefficient of the aluminum metal surface were measured at room temperature (≈300 K) with a pin-on-disk machine at a fixed load of 196.2 N. Two different testing configurations were adopted: (1) aluminum pin vs. Helix oil-on-steel disk (AHS) and (2) aluminum pin vs. 10% Polytron plus 90% helix oil-on-steel disk (APS). In the AHS configuration, the wear of the aluminum surface was found to be approximately 70 μm; however, in the APS configuration the wear dropped to 20 μm, revealing a marked decrement of one-third of the wear of aluminum. The volume wear rate of the metal in the unaided Helix oil was estimated to be 1.28×10–3 mm3/min. The additive minimized the volume wear rate of the aluminum metal by orders of magnitude to 6.08×10–5 mm3/min. Similarly, the wear coefficient of the aluminum pin, calculated in the AHS configuration, rendered a value of 1.27×10–10 m2/N. In the APS configuration, the same parameter was 4.22×10–11 m2/N, that is to say, an order of magnitude lower than the preceding value. The observed coefficient of friction for aluminum is 0.012 in Helix oil and falls to a remarkably lower value of 0.004 through the Polytron additive. The experimental findings demonstrate that Polytron additive substantially lessens the wear of the aluminum surface; in effect, the wear coefficient and the wear rate decline linearly. This singularity may be linked to the ability of Polytron to impregnate the crystal structure of the metal due to its ionic character and the consequent adherence to the metallic surface as a hard surface layer."

Pin-on-disc testing was performed under dry sliding conditions to determine the wear characteristics of prepared composite surfaces. The homogeneity of particle distribution both inside the copper matrix and in the wear scar was determined via microstructural observations. It was observed that both microsized and nanosized SiCps were well distributed and homogenous in a stir zone; particles observed were without defects, and good bonding was observed between SiCps and the copper matrix. Comparisons between Cu/SiCp composite layers and friction stir processed (FSPed) Cu and as-received Cu showed that Cu/SiCp nanocomposite layers exhibited superior microhardness and dry sliding wear characteristics."

To investigate the thermal-oxidation mechanism, the thermal-oxidation products were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC−MS), and the thermal-oxidation process was simulated using visual reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD). The results indicated that the total acid number (TAN) increased significantly because of the presence of 14% carboxylic acids and low molecular weight monoesters. The tribological properties were improved by the formation of the strongly polar carboxylic acids. Additionally, the increase in kinematic viscosity was limited due to the formation of high molecular weight polymerization products and low molecular weight degradation products. Thermal-oxidative degradation and polymerization mechanisms were proposed by combining ReaxFF MD simulations and GC−MS results."

Considering these aspects, this work puts in evidence the importance of clogging occurrence and the coated paper structure for a carefully application of shape parameters. In addition, it is proposed a possible relation between the shape parameters and one of the components of the abrasion factor."

It was found that the use of a skid probe can introduce significant distortion of the measured wear track profiles and thus errors in wear quantification. The reason for that is attributed to the presence of the ridges that, by elevating the skid, alter artificially the reference height used for profile measurement."

abstract,"Abstract The increasing global environmental awareness, evidenced by recent worldwide calls for control of climate change and greenhouse emissions, has placed significant new technical mandates for automotives to improve engine efficiency, which is directly related to the production of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Reduction of parasitic losses of the vehicle, powertrain and the engine systems is a key component of energy conservation. For engine efficiency improvement, various approaches include improvements in advanced combustion systems, component system design and handling—such as down-sizing, boosting, and electrification—as well as waste heat recovery systems etc. Among these approaches, engine friction reduction is a key and relatively cost-effective approach, which has been receiving significant attention from tribologists and lubricant-lubrication engineers alike. In this paper, the fundamentals of friction specific to the environments of engine components tribology are reviewed, together with discussions on the impact of developing vehicle powertrain technologies, surface and material technologies, as well as lubricant and additive technologies on promises of continuing friction and wear reduction trends. The international accords on climate change require further gains in fuel efficiency and energy sustainability from all industry sectors including those in the automotive and the broader internal combustion engine industries, and the latter encompass off-highway, power generation, marine, and rail industries as well. This paper focsuses on friction reduction in mainly automotive engines, however.The paper starts with a clarification of the common descriptors of mechanical losses and friction in the engine, followed by the topic of lubrication fundamentals such as lubrication regimes. Then the lubrication of the contacting surfaces in each of the major engine subsystems is discussed in turn. These subsystems include the piston assembly: ring-pack/liner, piston-skirt/liner, and piston-pin/connecting-rod contacts; connecting rod and crankshaft bearings; and the valvetrain subsystem. The relative contributions to total friction from the various subsystems are discussed, with the piston-assembly contributing to about half of the total friction. The remainder of the friction comes from the crankshaft, connecting rod, camshaft bearings, and the valvetrain oscillating parts. The bearings are in predominantly hydrodynamic lubrication, in contrast to the valvetrain oscillating components, which are characterized to be mostly in the mixed/boundary lubrication regimes.Despite the title of the paper, a section on emerging powertrain technologies—including that of combustion in gasoline and diesel engines—is also given in the context of the trend towards clean and efficient propulsion systems. The impact of these developing technologies on the reduction of friction and parasitic losses via component, material, and lubricant deisgn will be discussed. These technologies include gasoline direct injection (GDI), turbocharged, and hybrid vehicles and will generate unique green environmental opportunities for future propulsion systems. These technologies are critical to meet fuel economy and reduced emission targets. Specifically, this paper will address the impact of these emerging technologies on future lubricant requirements and advanced tribology research. The connection between these lubricant and tribological requirements will be illustrated by briefly describing the basic lubrication and friction processes at the major engine components incorporating the emerging technologies.Lastly, besides new hardware and material science changes, several advanced additives such as advanced friction modifiers, antiwear additive chemistries, low viscosity lubricants, and the introduction of new VI Improvers all represent possible tribological solutions to the challenge of meeting more stringent energy efficiency requirements and environmental legislation. As original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) seek to accomplish these goals, hardware and emission system changes will place new demands and even greater stress on engine oils. At the same time, engine durability, performance and reliability are of primary importance to vehicle owners and operators. The final section of this paper will discuss the future trends of engine friction reduction and wear control by surface modification such as friction-reducing coatings or surface textures in engine components. The impact of surface coatings or surface textures on engine friction will be reviewed. In addition, the OEMs and lubricant formulation manufacturers will need to respond with novel engine oil technologies formulated to protect the engine, keeping the emissions system working at the optimal fuel economy, while retaining engine durability.In brief, the paper (i) reviews the characteristics of component friction in the environment of the internal combustion engine and the relevant design considerations, (ii) addresses the impact of emerging technologies on engine friction and the tribological changes and requirements, especially on lubricant and additives, and lastly (iii) discusses the interactions between lubricant-additive formulations and material surface engineering, and their effects on friction, wear and engine durability. The increasing importance and interplay between synergistic advancements in component design, material and surface engineering, and advanced lubricant-additive formulation will be fully illustrated."

Friction coefficients for the lubricants in each group, measured with a pin-on-disk tribometer, are summarized in the form of Stribeck curves. Wear of the disk specimens due to rubbing in the interfaces lubricated with the tested oils is evaluated by surface topographic changes. The results indicate that for surfaces of similar roughness, viscosity has the predominant influences on the friction and wear-protection properties of these lubricants."

abstract,"Abstract It has been shown before that liquids can slip at a solid boundary, which prompted the idea that parallel-surfaces bearings can be achieved just by alternating slip and non-slip regions in the direction of fluid flow. The amount of slip at the wall depends on the surface tension at the liquid–solid interface, which in turn depends on the chemical state of the surface and its roughness. In the present study a heterogeneous surface was obtained by coating half of a circular glass disc with a coating repellant to glycerol. A rotating glass disc was placed at a known/calibrated distance and the gap was filled with glycerol. With the mobile surface moving from the direction of slip to non-slip region it can be theoretically shown that a pressure build up can be achieved. The pressure gradient in the two regions is constant, similar to that in a Rayleigh step bearing, with the maximum pressure at the separation line. The heterogeneous disc was placed on a holder supported by a load cell thus the force generated by this pressure increase can be measured accurately. Tests were carried out at different sliding speeds and gaps and the load carried was measured and subsequently compared with theoretical calculations. This allowed the slip coefficient to be evaluated."

abstract,"Abstract Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a high-performance thermoplastic, which is often selected for hightemperature tribological applications under chemically aggressive environments. The present work investigates the tribological behavior of a high-performance PEEK composite under conditions that are often found inside hermetic compressors. Therefore, an AMTI tribometer equipped with a hermetic chamber and a heating system was used to conduct sliding tests of PEEK cylinders on AISI 304 stainless steel polished discs (S q <10 nm) with reciprocating movement and a normal force of 175 N. The tribological behavior of the PEEK/AISI 304 stainless steel system was investigated as a function of ambient temperature (30 °C and 80 °C) and atmosphere (atmospheric air and tetrafluoroethane). Wear and surface roughness analyses were performed with white light interferometry and optical microscopy. Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate transfer films on the counter body surface. Temperature was observed to have a strong influence on the tribological behavior of the samples tested under atmospheric air, with a 25% decrease in the friction coefficient associated with a 100% increase in the wear rate. However, the friction measured from the samples tested under a tetrafluoroethane atmosphere showed no significant temperature dependence."

abstract,"Abstract Hydrostatic assistance is a commonly used method to improve limited load carrying ability of tiltingpad thrust bearings during transient states of operation of vertical shaft hydro-generators. Despite of special hydraulic equipment (as pumps, valves, etc.), it also requires manufacturing of special recesses/pockets at pad sliding surfaces, into which oil is injected under high pressure. It allows to lift the rotor before start-up of the machine and form a hydrostatic film between pads and collar. There is a quite wide variety of geometry of recesses (shape, depth, and size) met in practical large bearing applications. The presence of a hydrostatic pocket (usually located in the sliding surface above the pivot area, where thin film, high oil pressure and temperature are observed) affects bearing performance under hydrodynamic operation.In theoretical researches, there is an almost common practice not to include hydrostatic recess in thermohydrodynamic (THD) or thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) analysis. This is probably due to the problems with obtaining solution for oil film geometry with pocket, the order of magnitude of the pocket depths being larger than gap thickness. In this paper, an attempt was taken to study the effect of lifting pocket on THD performance of a large tilting-pad thrust bearing of Itaipu power plant. Bearing performance was evaluated including recess shape for several cases of its depth. The results show that hydrostatic recess changes calculated bearing properties quite significantly, especially in vicinity of the pocket."

abstract,"Abstract Magnetorheological (MR) fluid damper which allows the damping characteristics of the damper to be continuously controlled by varying the magnetic field is extensively used in metal cutting to suppress tool vibration. Even though magnetorhelogical fluids have been successful in reducing tool vibration, durability of magnetorhelogical fluids remains a major challenge in engineering sector. Temperature effect on the performance of magnetorhelogical fluids over a prolonged period of time is a major concern. In this paper, an attempt was made to reduce temperature and to improve viscosity of magnetorhelogical fluids by infusing nanoparticles along with MR fluids. Aluminium oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles of 0.1% and 0.2% concentration by weight were considered and experimental tests were conducted to study the influence of nanoparticles on the performance of magnetorheological fluid. From the experimental results it was observed that the presence of nanoparticles in MR fluid reduces temperature and increases the viscosity of MR fluid thereby increasing the cutting performance during turning of hardened AISI 4340 steel."

abstract,"Abstract The oil viscosity specification for wind turbine gear oils is ISO VG 320, although there are quite different viscosity indexes oils for that viscosity specification. This work evaluates the behaviour of different base oil formulations, since polyalphaolefin (PAO), mineral, ester and polyalkeleneglycol (PAG) that withstand quite different viscosity indexes. The oils evaluation was done in rolling bearing tests and gear tests. Their behaviour was compared for operating conditions in the range observable in a wind turbine gearbox.The experimental results showed considerable differences between the different oils and it was observed that depending on the contact type the relative behaviour of the lubricants would change, i.e., the best lubricant for the rolling bearing would not imply the best result on the gear tests.The gear geometry is also very important toward the transmission efficiency, once using a low loss gear concept a decrease of up to 25% in torque loss could be achieved.Numerical models were implemented with the purpose of performing a better simulation of the mechanical system and also to obtain the friction coefficient promoted by the tested oils."

abstract,"Abstract Superlubricity means non-sticky and frictionless when two bodies are set contacting motion. Although this occurrence has been extensively investigated since 1859 when Faraday firstly proposed a quasiliquid skin on ice, the mechanism behind the superlubricity remains uncertain. This report features a consistent understanding of the superlubricity pertaining to the slipperiness of ice, self-lubrication of dry solids, and aqueous lubricancy from the perspective of skin bond-electron-phonon adaptive relaxation. The presence of nonbonding electron polarization, atomic or molecular undercoordination, and solute ionic electrification of the hydrogen bond as an addition, ensures the superlubricity. Nonbond vibration creates soft phonons of high magnitude and low frequency with extraordinary adaptivity and recoverability of deformation. Molecular undercoordination shortens the covalent bond with local charge densification, which in turn polarizes the nonbonding electrons making them localized dipoles. The locally pinned dipoles provide force opposing contact, mimicking magnetic levitation and hovercraft. O:H−O bond electrification by aqueous ions has the same effect of molecular undercoordination but it is throughout the entire body of the lubricant. Such a Coulomb repulsivity due to the negatively charged skins and elastic adaptivity due to soft nonbonding phonons of one of the contacting objects not only lowers the effective contacting force but also prevents charge from being transited between the counterparts of the contact. Consistency between theory predictions and observations evidences the validity of the proposal of interface elastic Coulomb repulsion that serves as the rule for the superlubricity of ice, wet and dry frictions, which also reconciles the superhydrophobicity, superlubricity, and supersolidity at contacts."

abstract,"Abstract This investigation reports on the effect of Jatropha oil doped with lube oil on tribological characteristics of Al-7%Si alloy. The factors involved were Jatropha oil percentages, sliding velocities and load which was optimized for weight loss, friction coefficient and specific wear rate characteristics. The conventional lubricant was SAE 40. It is observed that the Jatropha oil percentage factor had significant influence on the weight loss, friction coefficient and wear rate of the pin. The optimum result was A 2 B 3 C 1 for pin weight loss, friction coefficient and wear rate. From the experimental result, it is found that the wear scar diameter increases with the increase of load for lube oil and reduced by addition of percentage of Jatropha oil. Flash temperature parameter was also studied in this experiment and results show that 15% addition of Jatropha oil would result in less possibility to film breakdown. The overall results of this experiment reveal that the addition of 15% Jatropha oil with base lubricant produces better performance and anti-wear characteristics. This blend can be used as lubricant oil which is environment friendly in nature and would help to reduce petroleum based lubricant substantially."

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify the composition of the AM leaf-surface wax, and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to investigate its friction mechanisms. The results suggest that the leaf-surface wax could successfully reduce the friction and wear of steel-steel sliding pairs compared with PAO containing molybdenum dithiocarbamate additives. AM, in particular, showed high-performance wear resistance and friction-reducing properties. Its excellent tribological properties were attributed to the wax composition of leaf-surface fatty acids, alcohol, and esters."

abstract,"Abstract In this study, the effects of deep cryogenic treatment (DCT) on the mechanical and tribological properties of AISI D3 tool steel were investigated together with a systematic correlation between their hardness and wear resistance. It was found that conventionally heat treated AISI D3 tool steel samples were significantly hardened via an additional DCT, which was attributed to the more retained austenite elimination, more homogenized carbide distribution and more reduction in carbide size in the samples. As a result, the hardened AISI D3 samples exhibited reductions in their friction and wear during rubbing against alumina and 100Cr6 steel balls under different normal loads due to the effectively hindered removal of surface materials. The results clearly showed that the DCT was an effective way to improve the mechanical and tribological properties of the AISI D3 tool steel samples as the tribological performance of the tool steel samples was significantly influenced by their hardness."

abstract,"Abstract Tribocorrosion is a degradation mechanism resulting from the interaction of mechanical (wear) and chemical (corrosion) phenomena. This interaction leads to surface damage that does not correspond to the simple sum of wear and corrosion taken separately. Testing tribocorrosion of material pairings thus requires the capability not only to control the mechanical and chemical test parameters but also to identify the relative contribution of corrosion and wear in the overall material degradation. This paper describes a novel laboratory tribocorrosion test set-up combining in one experiment the control of mechanical input (load, velocity, and frequency) and output (friction and wear) parameters as well as the control of corrosion phenomena through a series of dedicated electrochemical methods (open circuit, potentiostatic and potentiodynamic measurements). The possibilities offered by this set-up are illustrated by selected case studies."

abstract,"Abstract In this study, we evaluated the wear properties of four brands of brake pad available in the Nigerian market. In particular, we assessed the tribo performance and service life of the brake pads. We purchased four commercial brands of brake pads used in light duty cars and coded them as AU, SN, TY and SM, respectively. A small piece of the brake pad lining materials was carefully chiseled from the back plates to obtain samples for the experiments. We conducted Brinell hardness tests using a tensometer and a pin-on-disc test rig to determine the coefficient of friction and the wear characteristics of the materials. We then correlated the wear on each set of brake pads with the running time and used Weibull’s equation to determine average service life. Sample TY exhibited the highest hardness value (29.09) and sample SN the lowest (10.05). The determined coefficients of friction ranged between 0.3–0.36, with sample AU exhibiting the lowest value and sample SM the highest. Sample SN showed the lowest wear rate of 3.53 × 109 g/min, while the wear rates of samples TY, AU, and SM were 5.64 × 108, 8.19 × 109, and 2.10 × 108 g/min, respectively. The relative service life of samples SN, TY, and AU were similar, with average values of 2778.09, 2725.41, and 2717.34 min, respectively, and SM had a relatively low service life (2017.82 min). We conclude that the overall performances of Nigerian brake pads do not meet all the specifications for friction materials used in road vehicle brake linings and pads."

abstract,"Abstract Ciliate epibionts inhabit aquatic systems globally and may exert negative impacts on their hosts. Evidence of the environmental drivers of these epibionts is lacking. This study aimed to test the effects of turbidity on the attachment success of the ciliate Epistylis sp. on the copepod Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni in the turbid St Lucia Estuary, South Africa. Epistylis sp. was exposed to P. stuhlmanni individuals for 24 h under six turbidity treatments (range 8–1,500 NTU). The prevalence and density of Epistylis sp. exposed to inorganic silt decreased significantly across the turbidity range in both runs of this experiment. In the natural silt treatments, prevalence increased with turbidity up to 500 and 250 NTU in the first and second experiment, respectively. Beyond these peaks, prevalence decreased. Density peaked at 250 NTU in both experiments. High prevalence and density in the natural silt experiments is directly related to the high organic matter content in this treatment. Association of Epistylis sp. with turbidity may impact negatively P. stuhlmanni, as the longevity of this copepod is negatively related to heavy cover by Epistylis sp. and to turbidity. These findings show that environmental factors may play a key role in modulating epibiotic interactions."

abstract,"Abstract Benthic macroinvertebrates inhabit the streambed sediments of temporary streams during drying events. Fine sediment (< 2 mm in diameter) deposition and clogging of interstitial pathways reduces the connectivity between benthic and subsurface habitats, potentially inhibiting macroinvertebrate vertical movements. Direct observations within subsurface sediments are, however, inherently difficult. As a result, confirmation of macroinvertebrate vertical movement, and the effect of fine sediment, is limited. We used laboratory mesocosms containing transparent gravel sized particles (10–15 mm) to facilitate the direct observation and tracking of vertical movements by Gammarus pulex in response to water level reduction and sedimentation. Seven sediment treatments comprised two fine sediment fractions (small: 0.125–0.5 mm, coarse sand: 0.5–1 mm) deposited onto the surface of the substrate, and a control treatment where no fine sediment was applied. We found that G. pulex moved into the subsurface gravel sediments in response to drying, but their ability to remain submerged during water level reduction was impeded by fine sediment deposition. In particular deposition of the coarser sand fraction clogged the sediment surface, limiting vertical movements. Our results highlight the potential effect of sedimentation on G. pulex resistance to drying events in streams."

abstract,"Abstract Mahseers, the members of the fish genus Tor, are economically important as sport and food fishes, but their population is declining in South and Southeast Asia. Taxonomic discrepancies exist in discussions surrounding a few species of mahseer in India. In this study, we hypothesize that Tor mosal is wrongly synonymized with T. putitora, and T. barakae with T. tor. To test this, we collected samples from the type localities, and from known distribution areas. We observed a clear morphological distinctiveness among these four species using Principal Component Analysis. The most prominent distinctive parameters among the four species were body depth and head length. Phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood for both partial mtCOI and mtCytb datasets revealed monophyletic origin, and supported distinctive species level delimitation which was consensus with morphological identity. Moreover, the automatic species delimitation methods (ABGD and PTP) also quantify the four species. The mean K2P distance was 1.57% between T. putitora and T. tor, 2.60% between T. mosal and T. putitora, 3.27% between T. mosal and T. tor, and 2.63% between T. barakae and T. tor. Based on this study, we validate T. mosal and T. barakae, and provide taxonomic keys to the species."

abstract,"Abstract In Europe, the so-called Water Framework Directive was established to achieve a good ecological status of natural water bodies by 2015. In the case of heavily modified and artificial water bodies, the principle of a good ecological potential (GEP) applies. Methods  have been developed for the evaluation of natural water bodies. However, these methods do not take the uniqueness of the assessment of heavily modified and artificial water bodies into consideration. On behalf of a working group on water issues of the federal states and the federal government (called LAWA), a nationwide assessment method of the GEP has been developed and its application has been verified within the framework of a practical project. Federal Waterways were not sufficiently considered. Hence we have been prompted to develop an assessment method for heavily modified and artificial water bodies, especially for federal waterways. Nearly 80% of the German federal water bodies are designated as heavily modified and artificial. The inclusion of federal waterways allows the unique characteristics of large rivers to be integrated in the methodological framework. Hereinafter, the results of the first working steps of the investigation as well as the methodological framework will be presented."

However, it may not be adequate to quantify the bioavailability of dissolved organic P compounds. This study aimed to investigate to what extent the colorimetrically measurable P fractions can be utilized by algae, with a particular emphasis on organic P compounds in a hypersaline aquatic environment. In this study, the growth of the marine alga Dunaliella tertiolecta Butcher was observed in axenic hypersaline cultures prepared with different organic P forms and related to the corresponding levels of colorimetrically measured P and total P. The malachite green method was used to colorimetrically analyze the different P forms and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy was used to quantify the total P. The results showed that only creatine P was colorimetrically detectable, of which 87% of its total concentration was measured. The growth of algae in the culture media with organic P compounds did not reflect the colorimetrically measurable organic P compounds. The results from this study imply that colorimetric analysis may not be sufficient to assess P availability to algae in hypersaline conditions where organic P components are the main source of P."

We analysed 89 adults from Uruguay River Basin (Brazil) collected during the two consecutive non-reproductive periods, and assessed the genetic diversity levels using eleven microsatellite loci. Our results showed that populations are genetically structured, suggesting these fish can remain grouped likely due to a cooperative behaviour, not related to reproduction, in a typical shoaling behaviour. Besides, we found high genetic diversity for S. brasiliensis from the Turvo State Park area, highlighting the importance of this conservation unit as a relevant area for maintaining the genetic variability of S. brasiliensis in the Uruguay River."

abstract,"Abstract Lakes and reservoirs are important sites for biogeochemical cycling on both regional and global scales. Shallow lakes often have higher coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) because of increased light penetration to the sediment as well as stronger interactions between the sediment and the water column. These biotic and abiotic interactions can strongly affect nutrient cycling. This study evaluated how hydrologically driven changes in SAV coverage affected nutrient processing within a relatively shallow reservoir. To assess these effects, a comprehensive water quality sampling network was established that quantified nutrient concentrations in the inflows and outflow of the lake. Annual vegetation surveys quantified the spatial coverage of SAV. Annual inflow was significantly lower in the first year of the study compared to the following 2 years. Consequently, SAV coverage was also highest during the lowest flows in the first year and was lower in the following 2 years when flows were greater. NO3-N concentrations were also lowest within Hydrilla beds and in the outflow during the growing season of the first year. Our results suggest that hydrological variation was the main driving variable of SAV coverage, and that the extent of SAV coverage strongly controlled nutrient processing at the whole-reservoir scale."

abstract,"Abstract Non-native species are a major threat to aquatic ecosystems and the assessment of their invasiveness may be limited by the diverse ecological features needed to be accounted for. In this study, we combined complementary features of the autoecology and trophic ecology of Hemimysis anomala in a large deep lake (Lake Bourget) to assess its invasiveness. It was present in more than 80% of the 23 sites explored, indicating an extensive colonization of the lake. The mysid exhibited at least two generations per year, and the median individual growth rate was ~ 0.04 mg dry mass day−1 and ~ 0.09 mg dry mass day−1 for juveniles and adults, respectively. Consequently, the daily production for a typical reproductive swarm could reach more than 250 mg dry mass day−1 m−2 representing an important hotspot of secondary production. Individual measurements of stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes highlighted a trophic ontogenetic shift and indicated that subpopulations of H. anomala could mainly rely either on benthic or pelagic resources depending on the slope of the site. Because of its extensive colonization, its high growth rate, and trophic plasticity, H. anomala exhibits a high invasiveness and may strongly alter the food web of Lake Bourget."

abstract,"Abstract Until recently, the distribution of diatom and chironomid assemblages and their attributes (species richness/diversity) in relation to water depth and sedimentary environments have been identified but not quantified. The influence of environmental variables on assemblage distribution and taxa richness in a deep, monomictic lake in São Miguel Island is assessed. Attention is given to community variation along a water-depth gradient. Sediment core samples were analysed for diatom content, chironomids, and grain-size clastic particles along three transects from the shoreline to the central deep basin of the lake at a resolution of 1 m water depth. Linear and unimodal regressions were used to test taxon richness, taxon diversity and taxon evenness versus water depth of each transect. A hump-shaped relationship between species richness and water depth was noted, with a peak occurring at mid-depth, meaning that samples located at that depth better represented the total subfossil assemblage living in lake Azul. Moreover, data indicate that both assemblages in Lake Azul, and taphonomic effects, were influenced by processes of clastic transport depending on the lake morphology. Results  from this study allow us to access the spatial distribution of biological assemblages in clastic-dominated lakes with a high topographic gradient, and provide us with principal criteria that will allow us to determine coring locations that capture the true species diversity for studies in lakes."

abstract,"Abstract Dredging Austrian Danube harbours becomes necessary to keep the navigation channel free from bed sediment and to insure safe navigation, especially after major floods. In most cases, the excavated substrate is deposited in the free-flowing river section in the vicinity of the mouth of a harbour. The effects of harbour dredging on the biota need to be studied to minimize possible outcomes that may endanger the ecological status of the river system in order to implement the aims of the European Water Framework Directive. This study presents the first quantitative information on the colonisation of benthic invertebrates with respect to Danube harbours. One sampling at Linz Harbour was conducted before dredging and four samplings were carried out after dredging. Four transects were documented in the affected river section. The study used an air-lift sampler and a grab sampler to investigate if and to what extent the benthic invertebrate community is disturbed. It found that the sediment dredging heavily affected the benthic invertebrates (decline of 82% of biomass), while the dumping of the material had no effects on the benthic Danube biota. As a rough estimate (conferring to a simple trend line analysis) the harbour bottom fauna would recover after 235 days."

abstract,"Abstract Carotenoid-based signals may function as indicators of individual quality because, being exclusively obtained from the diet, they indicate the ability of individuals to intake high-quality food. Moreover, carotenoids are involved in several important physiological functions, including antioxidant defense, so that carotenoid-based colorations have been suggested to reflect the antioxidant status of their bearers. The present correlative, cross-sectional study aimed at investigating if the skin carotenoid-based coloration is a signal of antioxidant defenses in the brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758). We investigated the relationships between carotenoid-based coloration traits (including the number, density and redness of red spots, as well as the ventral yellowness), and both non-enzymatic (plasma and liver total antioxidant capacity) and enzymatic antioxidant defenses (activity of hepatic superoxide dismutase —SOD, catalase —CAT and glutathione peroxidase —GPx). We found significant positive covariations between antioxidant defenses and carotenoid-based skin coloration, in terms of ventral yellowness. Brown trout individuals displaying intense carotenoid-based coloration (i.e., ventral yellowness) had a high non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity both in plasma and in liver and, interestingly, an elevated activity of hepatic SOD and CAT. Our data suggest that carotenoid-based skin colorations may be considered a signal of individual quality in terms of antioxidant defenses in the brown trout."

abstract,"Abstract In Europe, two bisexual fish species, Cobitis taenia (TT) and Cobitis elongatoides (EE), hybridized, producing diploid and polyploid clonal lineages. This study compared, for the first time, embryonic development, hatching success, sex ratio, body size and as well as reproductive ability based on the gonad histology of F1 reciprocal diploid hybrids (TE, ET) of both species. Hybrid F1 progeny showed the same proper pattern of embryonic and larval development. Among TE and ET offspring, slightly more females and males, respectively, occurred, but sex parity among 18-month-old hybrids was observed. Two- and three-year-old F1 hybrid females were mature, possessing all stages of oogenesis in their ovaries. Females (TE) back-crossed with C. taenia males had properly developing progeny. In testes of two- and three-year-old F1 hybrids, only early stages of spermatogenesis and pyknotic cells indicating the degeneration process were observed, but they exhibited an external feature (lamina circularis) of maturation. The results were confirmed by the structure of gonads that two sexual species, C. taenia and C. elongatoides, hybridize, producing F1 progeny of sterile males and fertile females. Hybrid females may participate in subsequent steps of speciation via hybridization and polyploidy or, on the contrary, represent an element of new species isolation."

abstract,"Abstract Based on the fact that the intense photosynthetic activity of blooms causes a marked decrease in free CO2 concentrations and increase in pH of the water, the aim of the present study was to investigate the competitive relationship between Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa under different pH and inorganic carbon conditions. Our hypothesis is that C. raciborskii is a better competitor than M. aeruginosa in alkaline pH and when bicarbonate (HCO3−) is the main source of carbon. Semi-continuous cultures were conducted in a factorial experiment with three different pH conditions (free [unbuffered], 6.8 and 8.2), with and without aeration, and with and without the addition of a bicarbonate source. Both species demonstrated a good performance under high pH, but the interaction between the factors determined significant differences in the competitive responses of the C. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa strains, with a change in dominance in the different scenarios. Whilst C. raciborskii was favoured by aeration, the addition of bicarbonate improved the growth of M. aeruginosa. The results suggest that affinity and efficiency in bicarbonate use may be a determinant of dominance and competitive success in potentially toxic cyanobacteria, such as the genus Microcystis."

abstract,"Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of use of marine resources in recruitment of Southern Hemisphere native riverine fish Galaxias maculatus from rivers across a latitudinal gradient. To do this, we analysed the concentrations of δ34S in vertebral column tissues from fish collected in ten Chilean river systems across latitudes 36°–47°S. The analyses of δ34S signatures in these rivers suggest that the use of marine resources by riverine populations of G. maculatus in large river systems in Chile is variable, with marine resources playing a limited role in more northern large rivers, characterised by warmer temperatures and predictable flow regimes and floodplain inundations. This is in contrast to life histories described for G. maculatus in rivers from New Zealand and Australia, where riverine populations are believed to be characterised by an obligatory recruitment phase in marine environments. Recruitment of G. maculatus in Chilean large rivers appears to depend on their freshwater productivity driven by climate as well as both longitudinal (headwaters lakes-estuary) and lateral (main channel-floodplains) hydrologic connectivities."

abstract,"Abstract Understanding and predicting vegetation patterns in floodplains are essential for conservation and/or restoration of river floodplains subject to hydrological alterations. We propose a conceptual hydroecological model to explain the disturbance mechanisms driving species diversity across large river floodplains. These ecosystems harbor a unique set of flood-tolerant species different from the surrounding upland vegetation. In elevation gradients across pristine floodplains, the greater the flooding, the fewer the number of plant species. As terrain elevation increases, flood depth and duration decrease and it is more likely that species composition is influenced by external natural or human-driven disturbances. The spatial interaction between the natural flood regime and upland factors creates patterns of disturbance gradients that influence how floodplain vegetation establishes. In regions where upland conditions are subject to strong external disturbances, species diversity peaks at intermediate stages along the disturbance gradient. We demonstrate this concept with observations from the Central Amazon and Pantanal in Brazil, the Mekong’s Tonle Sap in Cambodia, and the Okavango Delta in Botswana. We discuss how this model could be further elaborated and validated to inform management of large river basins under the impact of upstream-induced flood pulse alterations."

abstract,"Abstract IPCC predictions indicate an increase in temperatures by 1.5–7°C in some Amazonian regions during the twenty-first century. These changes could disrupt the present distribution patterns of organisms, including wetland plant species. In this work, we determined in microcosms the effects of scenarios combining elevated temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration on the germination and initial growth of the arborescent Amazonian aquatic macrophyte Montrichardia arborescens. Seeds were germinated, and seedlings produced were monitored over a 5-month period in four microcosms: Control: ambient temperature and CO2 level; Mild: Control + 1.5°C and + 200 ppm CO2; intermediate: control + 2.5°C and + 400 ppm CO2; Extreme: Control + 4.5°C and + 850 ppm of CO2. Rapid light response curves and Fv/Fm values taken in seedlings showed a decrease in electron transportation rate with CO2 and temperature elevation. Mild and Intermediate treatments stimulated biomass production; Extreme treatment and Control produced similar results. The severe climatic changes expected in the future may negatively influence carbon accumulation in M. arborescens. Since aquatic macrophytes in Amazonian wetlands and wetlands worldwide are key plant species, further studies are needed to predict their fate in a global change perspective."

abstract,"Abstract Resource pulses provide short-duration, large-magnitude resources that influence ecosystem productivity, structure, and function. However, little empirical evidence is available evaluating how lake ecosystems respond to varying resource pulse magnitudes. We used mesocosms inoculated with primary producers and consumers to compare resource pulses of 0, 25, 50, 100, and 250 kg/ha of common carp Cyprinus carpio to simulate post-winterkill fish biomass in shallow lakes. Ecosystem responses to a gradient of resource pulse magnitudes typically had the greatest effects on nutrient availability and primary producers with fewer detectable effects for consumers. Total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrate, phytoplankton, and periphyton productions increased as a result of the resource pulse, whereas copepods were the only consumer observed to elicit a positive response. In contrast, pulse magnitude had little effect on ecosystem stability, trophic position, or energy flow, potentially due to the low biomass of pulse magnitudes introduced. Resource pulses of moderate or large size generally increased nutrient availability and primary productivity while decreasing water clarity, suggesting that resource pulses can be an important factor influencing shallow eutrophic lakes but that effects may not be proportional to pulse size."

abstract,"Abstract The Cumberland Marsh Region (CMR), located at the head of the Bay of Fundy, is an important area for waterbird foraging, and wetland restoration and creation. Wetland managers in the CMR have observed that waterbird usage is high when wetlands (impoundments) are newly created, but can decline upon impoundment aging—a phenomenon called wetland senescence that is not well understood. We examined surface water chemistry among newly created and older impoundments in the CMR during the summer months (when waterbird breeding and staging are important), and hypothesized that nutrient availability would be reduced in older impoundments if nutrient loadings were primarily of internal origin. Despite ample rainwater and proximate agricultural sources, macro and micronutrient concentrations in impoundment surface water were significantly higher in newly created impoundments (< 1 year), and reduced in older impoundments (> 30 years) and impoundments 5–7 years in age. We suspect that impoundment creation has potential to generate high productivity levels, and older impoundments lack land-derived nutrients and may not sustain long-term nutrient availability when waterfowl brood foraging is important. More research is required to better understand wetland rehabilitation strategies that can help sustain nutrient availability, and inputs and pathways in impoundments."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, a monitoring and modelling concept for ecological optimized harbour dredging and fine sediment disposal in large rivers is presented. According to the concept, first a preliminary assessment should be performed previous to the dredging and dumping procedure to derive knowledge about the current status in hydrodynamics, morphology and instream habitat quality. During the performance of the maintenance work, a high-resolution monitoring program has to be organized to measure flow velocities, the suspended sediment concentrations and the extent of the occurring plume. These data can then be compared with natural suspended sediment conditions and serve as input data for numerical sediment transport modelling. Furthermore, bathymetric surveys and biotic sampling enable the detection of possible effects of dredging and disposal in the post-dumping stage. Based on sediment transport modelling approaches, short- to mid-term developments of the sediment plume can be predicted with an additional and final habitat evaluation at the end of the project. This concept was applied and optimized during the maintenance work at the case study winter harbour Linz at the Danube River. The findings of the presented study highlight the necessity of integrated monitoring and modelling approaches for harbour dredging especially in large river systems."

abstract,"Abstract The objective of this research is to examine the history of lentic ecosystem salinity in the southern Pantanal wetlands (Brazil). The timing and controls on hydrochemical changes were inferred using sponge spicule and diatom paleoecology on a Holocene-aged sediment core from Nhecolândia, a lake district situated on a fossil lobe of the Taquari megafan. The oldest portion of the core contains Heterorotula fistula spicules, indicative of an ephemeral freshwater lake that existed until ~ 4.6 cal ka BP. Benthic diatoms of the genus Gomphonema and Eunotia appeared ~ 3.2 cal ka BP, indicating a shallow and dystrophic environment. A transition to a more permanent lake that hosted freshwater sponges (e.g., Corvoheteromeyenia spp.), and diatom assemblages (e.g., Cyclotella meneghiniana, Aulacoseira pantanalensis) endured until ~ 1.3 cal year BP; after this time, most sponges and planktic diatoms disappear from the sedimentary record. High abundances of Anomoeoneis sphaerophora and Craticula guaykuruorum in the latest Holocene reflect a transition to a hyperalkaline, saline lake environment. The results suggest that Nhecolândia’s saline lakes may evolve from freshwater precursors due to local (biochemical) and regional (geo-climatic) controls on water availability, which has implications for patterns of biodiversity and ecosystems services in Pantanal."

abstract,"Abstract Although the Orton’s rule was already questioned for several invertebrate lineages, it remains unchallenged in sponges. To assess its validity in Porifera, we investigated the reproductive cycle of five species of Demospongiae on a tropical rocky shore, aiming to determine the effect of some environmental variables (EVs) on the periodicity, density of reproductive elements, and population engagement in reproduction. All species reproduced continuously, with low percentage of reproductive individuals and low fecundity. Each species presented a set of models containing different EVs to explain their reproductive traits. In general, the relationship of the EVs on the percentage of reproductive individuals and density of gametes and embryos was delayed in 1–3 months. Temperature was amongst the factors that best explained the species reproduction, with a delay of 1 month being the factor most consistently found amongst the models. In addition, we carried out a meta-analysis and discovered that in temperate regions most species reproduced periodically, whilst in the tropics, a small percentage reproduced continuously. Our findings suggest that Orton’s Rule is partially sustained, as species reproduced continuously, but challenge the lack of the influence of the temperature and other EVs in the reproduction of tropical marine invertebrates."

abstract,"Abstract Phytoplankton is an important microbial component in many ecosystems, and thus, knowing the predictive variables of its distribution is very valuable. In this study, we evaluated the roles of niche-based and spatial processes on phytoplankton communities of nine lakes in southern Brazil (spatial distance covered of 220 km). Variation partitioning analysis was employed to determine the relative contributions of environmental and spatial variables on the distribution of prokaryotic (PRP) and eukaryotic (EUP) components of phytoplankton at multispatial extents. C-score analysis was carried out, at intra- and interlake scales, to examine whether phytoplankton species coexist less or more than expected by chance (taxa segregation and aggregation, respectively). Our results showed that, at broader spatial scales, both PRP and EUP distributions are mainly influenced by pure space, while at finer spatial scales, the two groups are mainly influenced by pure environment. PRP distribution at broader spatial scales was also significantly influenced by spatially structured environment, and was in general more affected by spatial variables than by EUP. Finally, a taxa segregation pattern was observed at the interlake scale. In general, our results suggest that niche-based processes are more important in structuring phytoplankton on the local scale while spatial processes on the regional scale."

abstract,"Abstract Salinity is hypothesized to influence the abundance of scyphozoan medusae in the East Asian Marginal Seas, as their spawning largely coincides with the summer monsoon season, and extreme rainfalls subject planulae to reduced salinity, presumably jeopardizing the recruitment of polyps. We examined the effects of different salinities (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 32) on body size, swimming speed, survivorship and settlement of planulae, and subsequent development of metamorphosed polyps of three bloom-forming scyphozoans: Chrysaora pacifica, Nemopilema nomurai, and Rhopilema esculentum. Their physiology and behaviors were affected by osmotic stress, but differed by species. At 5, planulae of all species died. At 10, C. pacifica could not settle but survived as plankton, whereas N. nomurai and R. esculentum could settle and develop into four-tentacle polyps, yet the former showing delayed development and tentacle abnormalities. The lowest salinities permitting normal recruitment of polyps were 10, 15, and 20 for R. esculentum, N. nomurai, and C. pacifica, respectively. Inter-annual variations in monsoon rainfall can alter hydrographic conditions in the polyp habitats, affecting medusa population sizes in the following year. The robustness to low salinity of R. esculentum and N. nomurai larvae may enable them to establish yet-to-be-identified polyp populations in brackish-water environments."

abstract,"Abstract We used the individual-based multidimensional functional diversity and the taxonomic approaches in a complementary way to describe phytoplankton communities in three coastal lagoons with different eutrophication status in the South of France. We sampled communities during three seasons, i.e., in autumn, spring, and summer. Using classical taxonomy, 107 taxa/morphotypes were identified in the nine communities. The individual-based functional approach allowed grouping these individuals into 20 functional entities according to their values for 5 traits related to trophic adaptations (cell size, mobility, trophic regime, coloniality, and pelagic/benthic life). Some species (e.g., Prorocentrum micans) emerged in multiple functional entities, showing the importance to consider intraspecific variability. The functional description of phytoplankton communities better reflected the hydrological functioning and the different eutrophication status of the lagoons than the taxonomic approach. Specific functional adaptations were identified in the nine communities. For example, phytoplankton organisms with heterotrophic and potentially mixotrophic abilities occurred when the availability of inorganic nutrient decreased, or when organic matter and small preys were potentially the main nutrient resources. The limitation has also favored small cells highly competitive for nutrients. Using functional indices together with taxonomic description has also helped revealing important aspects of community assembly, such as competitive exclusion in summer."

abstract,"Abstract Stream ecological theory predicts that the use of allochthonous resources declines with increasing channel width, while at the same time primary production and autochthonous carbon use by consumers increase. Although these expectations have found support in several studies, it is not well known how terrestrial runoff and/or inputs of primary production from lakes alter these longitudinal patterns. To investigate this, we analyzed the diet of filter-feeding black fly and caddisfly larvae from 23 boreal streams, encompassing gradients in drainage area, land cover and land use, and distance to nearest upstream lake outlet. In five of these streams, we also sampled repeatedly during autumn to test if allochthony of filter feeders increases over time as new litter inputs are processed. Across sites, filter-feeder autochthony was 21.1–75.1%, did not differ between black fly and caddisfly larvae, was not positively related to drainage area, and did not decrease with distance from lakes. Instead, lake and wetland cover promoted filter-feeder autochthony independently of stream size, whereas catchment-scale forest cover and forestry reduced autochthony. Further, we found no seasonal increase in allochthony, indicating low assimilation of particles derived from autumn litter fall. Hence, catchment properties, rather than local conditions, can influence levels of autochthony in boreal streams."

abstract,"Abstract The amphipod Eogammarus possjeticus is used as a potential living food in shrimp culture. Nevertheless, the productivity of the amphipod has been poorly studied. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of temperature on the individual development and biomass production of E. possjeticus. The results revealed that the embryonic development time of E. possjeticus was shortened when temperature increased from 15 to 27°C, and the shortest juvenile development time appeared at 21°C. The survival rate of juveniles decreased with increasing temperature, and the maximum specific growth rate was found at 21°C. Thus, a temperature of 21°C was found to be the optimum temperature for biomass production of E. possjeticus in the laboratory. A population growth model was constructed with the experiment data based on the continuous population growth determination assumption. The longest survival time of E. possjeticus was about 260 days, and the optimal output quantity was up to 3.27 × 108 individuals, which was 1.60 × 106 times of the initial cultured individuals under the ideal indoor experiments conditions. Our research shows that E. possjeticus has potential to be cultured under controlled conditions at a commercial scale and serve as a food for intensive shrimp aquaculture."

abstract,"Abstract Globally, multiple stressors acting on large rivers strongly influence their ecosystem functions. They do so by altering both their biodiversity and integrity, which may in turn degrade the available ecosystem services. We present the catchment characteristics and discuss different management strategies for the two longest European rivers, the Volga (3531 km) and the Danube (2850 km). Subsequently, we analyze patterns and characteristics of fish fauna of the two rivers based on a review of historical and recent fish surveys. The native fish community of the Danube is characterized by rheophilic species, whereas the Volga has a similar proportion of rheophilic and eurytopic fish, with increasing portions of rheophilic species in the Lower Volga and the Volga Delta. We analyzed the species composition of certain regions of the Volga and the Danube and found a range of 0.515–0.667 for the Jaccard distance. Our review and comparison of fish communities and fisheries between these two largest river systems in Europe indicate that the additive effects of multiple stressors cause impacts on their fish communities. Integrated management taking into account these stressors is needed in order to preserve riverine fish diversity and enhance sustainable fisheries."

abstract,"Abstract The temperature in the South Atlantic underwent an increase from 1948 to 2016, and the Brazilian coast is very likely suffering from climate change. We examined temporal shifts in the abundance of the fish fauna that inhabit shallow waters and aimed to associate these shifts with climate effects. We selected candidate species according to changes in their relative abundance over four decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) in a transition area between the tropical and subtropical regions in southeastern Brazil. Forty-seven species exhibited changes in abundance during the study period. Several small pelagic/planktophagous clupeoids (Anchoa lyolepis, Anchoa tricolor, Harengula clupeola, and Sardinella brasiliensis) reacted strongly to climate change with rapid population growth, whereas others (Anchoa marinii, Anchoviella brevirostris, Anchoviella lepidentostole, and Lycengraulis grossidens) decreased in relative abundance or disappeared. Some tropical species appear to be moving to this transition zone (e.g., Achirus lineatus, Ctenogobius boleosoma, and Haemulopsis corvinaeformis) because they appeared or increased populations. Conversely, subtropical species (e.g., Genidens barbus, Platanichthys platana, Boridia grossidens, and Trachinotus falcatus) decreased populations or disappeared, probably moving southward to more favorable areas, consistent with warming. This is the first estimation of climate change impacts on the southwestern Atlantic nearshore fishes and contributes as support for management policies."

abstract,"Abstract Methods  to distinguish nearshore and main channel ecosystems within large rivers are essential for observing physical, chemical, and biological features that influence overall river ecosystem function. Water velocity fields based on hydrodynamic modeling of water flow trajectory were used to evaluate water history (i.e., water moving slowly as in a slack water region, or more rapidly, as characteristic of the main channel) prior to passing a given point in the Upper St. Lawrence River. Using this method to differentiate zones in the river, observations of biotic and abiotic variables in nearshore and main channel zones during late spring and summer (June–August) were compared to assess the difference in these water column river ecosystems. Differences in plankton community composition between nearshore and main channel waters along the Upper St. Lawrence River were investigated to test the hypothesis that nearshore and main channel environments in large river systems have different biotic (e.g., phytoplankton, crustacean zooplankton, and rotifer concentrations) and abiotic [e.g., water temperature, specific conductivity, silicate, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and total phosphorus] characteristics. Nearshore water had significantly higher concentrations of CDOM and chlorophyll-a than main channel waters. With distance downstream, crustacean zooplankton and rotifers decreased in abundance in both nearshore and main channel regions. This study describes an effective method for stratified sampling design that differentiates nearshore and main channel ecosystems in the water column of large rivers."

abstract,"Abstract Intermittent rivers, which experience periods of flow cessation and streambed drying, occur globally. Given that the frequency and duration of stream drying events is likely to increase as a result of anthropogenic pressures and global climate change, riverbed sediments may become increasingly important as refuge habitat for benthic macroinvertebrates. Our study examined the effect of surface water loss and increasing drying duration on the survivorship of the most abundant benthic invertebrate, Gammarus pulex (L.) (Amphipoda: Gammaridae), inhabiting the wet subsurface sediments of exposed gravel bars within a perennial stream and a connected temporarily flowing side channel. G. pulex survivorship declined more over time during drying conditions compared to control conditions (flowing water present). Survivorship was greater in the temporary channel and may reflect the greater water retention capacity of fine sediments in the subsurface and abiotic stability compared to the free-draining exposed gravel bars on the main channel. Our results illustrate that saturated subsurface sediments may facilitate G. pulex persistence during surface drying events and highlight the need for effective refuge management and conservation for instream fauna during drying events."

abstract,"Abstract Invasive dreissenid mussels have altered plankton abundance and nutrient cycling in the Great Lakes. In this study, a 1-D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical coupled model is developed to investigate their effects at a mid-depth offshore site in Lake Michigan. Model simulation shows that water surface temperature and vertical thermal structure can be well reproduced. Driven by the simulated vertical mixing, the biological model solves the transport and transformation of nutrients, plankton and detritus in the water column. Mussel grazing and excretion are added at the bottom boundary. The biological model predicts a notable decline of phytoplankton biomass and considerable increase of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in the entire water column at the end of spring. However, the reduction of phytoplankton and the increase of DP are limited to the bottom 20 m in summer as a result of the strong stratification. Model results also show that mussels can maximize particle delivery to the benthos, as the modeled benthic diffusive flux of particulate phosphorus exceeds the passive settling rate by 4.2× on average. Model simulation over a 10-month period indicates that profundal mussels have the potential to significantly change the distribution of energy and nutrients in the water column, even in a deep and stratified environment."

abstract,"Abstract This study aimed to determine whether temporal variation of Bacillariophyceae and Dinophyceae changed spatially, to examine which bio-geographical features determined the spatial structure of Bacillariophyceae/Dinophyceae assemblages, and to compare between-zones variations in the phytoplankton taxonomic composition. The study is based on dataset collected during the period 2004–2007 along the coastal zones of the Gulf of Gabès using the STATIS multi-table method. This method allowed a measure of similarity between 15 sampling zones, the visualization of the species assemblages showing similar spatial variations and the reproducibility of this pattern for each zones’ association. High spatial gradient was evident for most species, and three large regions were obtained. Thirteen different taxa assemblages were then detected performing a common pattern of phytoplankton composition. For each assemblage, the most representative region which encompasses groups of zones with similar properties was identified. The hydrodynamic processes and geomorphologic properties of the different areas as well as anthropogenic activities are incriminated to play a major role in shaping the structural patterns of phytoplankton along the coastal zones of the Gulf of Gabès. This study suggested considering the bio-geographical features in the assessment of phytoplankton spatial assemblage."

abstract,"Abstract Fish-based index of biotic integrity (F-IBI) is widely used to assess river ecosystems. With survey data from the Yellow River fishery resources in the 1980s and 2008, fish composition and abundance, vertical distribution, trophic structure, reproductive guilds and tolerance in the river’s upstream, midstream, downstream, and estuary were examined, and F-IBI systems were established for each reach to assess river ecosystem health. Results  showed that compared to the 1980s, the number of fish species in 2008 sharply declined in the midstream and downstream reaches, percentage of benthic fish species decreased in upstream and estuary, the number and percentage of omnivorous species decreased in all reaches, and percentage of tolerant fish species increased 15 times in upstream but decreased in midstream and downstream. The F-IBI scores in the four reaches in the 1980s were all higher than those in 2008 and decreased from upstream to estuary; the healthy conditions indicated by F-IBI scores in the 1980s were “good,” “fair,” “poor,” and “fair” from upstream to estuary and “degraded” to “poor” in all the reaches in 2008. This indicated that the river ecosystem has degraded from the 1980s to 2008. This was also shown by variations in water chemistry."

abstract,"Abstract Wildfire is one of the most important global agents of disturbance affecting terrestrial and riparian vegetation. Post-fire vegetation changes can alter stream resource pathways and cause channel reorganization and sediment-laden debris flows. Yet, little is known about macroinvertebrate community recovery following wildfire and debris flows and how these communities fit into the broader stream community mosaic. We examined the effects of wildfire and debris flows on relative resource availability and macroinvertebrate assemblages at 31 streams in Idaho, USA using a space-for-time study design. Wildfire and debris flows had no apparent effects on resource standing crop. However, macroinvertebrate communities among unburned, burned, and debris flow streams were quite different. Compared to unburned streams, biomass and density were higher at streams which experienced debris flows ~ 10 years post fire, but exhibited the near-complete absence of macroinvertebrates at streams with more recent debris flows. Stream macroinvertebrate communities impacted by debris flows were distinct compared to unburned and burned streams which did not experience debris flows. When found, differences in macroinvertebrate biomass, density, richness, and community structures were largely due to the incidence of debris flows. Debris flows removed the riparian vegetation, slowing its recovery, cascading to affect macroinvertebrate community structure into the long term."

abstract,"Abstract Microbial processes involved in water biogeochemistry are linked to physical and chemical variability of water masses. While the occurrence of hydrological changes in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea has been documented, its effects on microbial dynamics and processes have been poorly investigated. An interdisciplinary survey was carried out in November 2011 to depict recent scenarios in the Ionian Mediterranean Sea. This study provides a snapshot of the hydrology and biogeochemistry of this basin, with particular emphasis on the abyssal waters, where two cores of the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water, both of Adriatic origin, were found. The first core, located at about 3000 m, overlies the second one, which has a recent origin. Both water masses have Adriatic origin and the upper one is older than the lower one. A novel approach has been adopted to relate changes in microbial abundance and metabolism to new thermohaline and biogeochemical findings. A close relationship between surface processes driven by air–sea interaction, microbial variables, physical and chemical parameters (nutrients, dissolved organic carbon and oxygen) was observed. Being intimately coupled to DOC patterns, the microbial respiratory activity was likely the most responsive microbial parameter to hydrological changes, confirming this variable as a sentinel of environmental changes."

abstract,"Abstract We investigated the composition and specialisation of shredder chironomids in an invasive white ginger lily (Hedychium coronarium) and in native pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata) leaves. We assumed that the difference of the chemical compound in macrophyte leaves would influence the shredder specialisation. A colonisation experiment was performed over 3 years (2013–2015) using 40 bags for each macrophyte species. The main macrophyte leaf chemical compounds (organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, cellulose, lignin, soluble polyphenols and soluble carbohydrates) were measured. The herbivore specialisation was estimated using the individual specialisation index (d′) and community specialisation index (H2′). White ginger lily had higher nitrogen and organic matter, resulting in a higher abundance of shredder specimens and lower specialisation than in native leaves. The Polypedilum fallax group, Stenochironomus and Endotribelos calophylli presented high individual specialisation (d′) in pickerelweed leaves, resulting in high community specialisation (H2′). The heterotrophic facilitation hypothesis explained the herbivores thriving in pickerelweed leaves due to their lower nutritional value. The intake-efficiency hypothesis explained the higher consumption of invasive plant tissue by Stenochironomus, due to its mining habit. We found evidence of evolutionary adaptation of freshwater herbivore eating habits."

abstract,"Abstract Rising temperatures likely affect the trophic interactions in temperate regions as global warming progresses. An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25°C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption."

abstract,"Abstract Floating-leaved rhizophytes and pleustophytes are the first barrier to Sun’s rays and significantly affect the light regime of the water column. To evaluate these effects on light attenuation, the reflectance and transmittance spectra variability were examined according to the leaf traits within three plant groups: (1) seed plants with green abaxial surfaces; (2) seed plants with red abaxial surfaces; and (3) ferns with trichomes. Specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll a and b, and UV-B and UV-A-absorbing substances differed between these three groups. The ‘spectral signatures’ of floating-leaved seed plants are similar to those of terrestrial seed plants, with a peak in the green region and a pronounced ‘red edge’. Ferns transmitted more light along the whole spectrum compared to other species. Most reflectance and transmittance spectra variability of the first group was explained by SLA. In the second group, 36% of the reflectance spectra variability was explained by tissue density and carotenoids, and 48% of the transmittance spectra variability by carotenoids, anthocyanins and SLA. In ferns, the reflectance spectra variability was mainly explained by chlorophylls, and partly by trichome length and mesophyll thickness, with the transmittance spectra variability significantly affected by chlorophyll b."

abstract,"Abstract The invasion of aquatic ecosystems by introduced invasive alien species (IAS) has become a worldwide phenomenon, and often leads to competitive interactions with native species. At high-nutrient levels, native species mostly are outcompeted by the introduced species. We performed an outdoor competition experiment between IAS free-floating Lemna minuta and native Lemna minor in a eutrophicated pond to examine whether the invasive species is the better competitor. We additionally performed an indoor experiment resembling mesotrophic phosphorus (P) conditions to investigate both species’ competitiveness in low P availability and compared with previous experiments at high-nutrient levels. Our results showed that in field conditions, the alien L. minuta was the better competitor. In the mesotrophic indoor condition, however, the native L. minor was the better competitor. Both species produced longer roots in the indoor experiment compared to field conditions. The species’ relative growth rates were also lower in the indoor experiment. A P reduction to mesotrophic condition in the water column thus might reduce invasive L. minuta growth and competitive performance. Additionally, introduction and recovery of L. minor could reduce L. minuta cover, but only following P reduction. Field experiments in mesotrophic ponds are needed to confirm these indoor findings."

abstract,"Abstract Water browning, due to increased runoff of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC), has recently gained considerable attention. While it is well settled how browning affects light regime and thereby aquatic primary production, other impacts on the aquatic biota is less explored. Water browning shelters against UV radiation, and may thus benefit range expansion of UV sensitive organisms, such as midges. We mapped occurrence of Chaoborids in 148 subalpine and alpine ponds in Norway, and identified an apparent threshold for their presence around 3 mg total organic carbon (TOC) l−1. The field study was complemented with laboratory experiments on Chaoborus nyblaei (Zetterstedt, 1838), to test if this species is able to identify and select water colour (concentrations of DOC) for oviposition. Number of egg rafts on brown water tanks was significantly higher than in clear water tanks, indicating that C. nyblaei performs oviposition habitat selection. Chaoborids are effective predators in planktonic habitats, and our findings support the hypothesis that climate change may cascade through the ecosystem and promote range shifts of species due to alternated habitat frame conditions."

The negative influence of toxins on surface waters was analysed. The method was verified on widespread freshwater macrophyte Lemna minor to test populations treated with non-ionic detergents. We showed that the proposed automated bioassay has a broad applicability in assessing the negative impacts of aquatic toxicants. This approach enabled fast and precise evaluation of the morphometric parameters of the duckweed test population. We observed that growth rate of L. minor reacts to non-ionic detergents, which is reflected by the change in the surface area. The decrease in the growth of L. minor was revealed at high doses of detergents. This test proved to be highly useful, because it is well repeatable and fast in its implementation. Unlike classical bioassays, the proposed test allows the elimination of measurement errors, resulting from observers’ subjectivity."

Only one fish from Sham control treatment died, and one tag was expelled through the incision in Tagged treatment. Growth rate parameters (i.e., absolute growth rate, condition factor, and weight) increased over the 30 days’ experiment in all treatments. Our results indicate that surgical implantation of transmitters into the peritoneal cavity is a viable option for acoustic telemetry studies of tainhas."

abstract,"Abstract The “risk assessment hypothesis” considers prey density as an important variable to properly assess the actual level of risk, and predicts that, when the ratio between predator cue concentration and prey density is constant, the level of risk perceived by prey is the same. All previous studies which tested this hypothesis with Anurans manipulated density by placing tadpoles into experimental tubs at fixed group sizes. As predation is a process that produces a progressive decrease in prey density, i.e. “thinning”, prey may respond to the rate of group size reduction rather than the absolute number of conspecifics in a given place at a given time. To test if Rana dalmatina tadpoles perceive the progressive decrease in population density due to predation and are able to use this information to fine-tune anti-predator responses, we combined thinning with a constant cue:density ratio and evaluated how these two types of information affected the level of activity of tadpoles. Our results showed no effect of density reduction on prey level of activity, and thinning did not interact with cue intensity to modify tadpoles’ behaviour. However, we observed no difference in tadpole behavioural responses between treatments with the same cue:density ratio."

abstract,"Abstract The assessment of ecological integrity of river systems is multidisciplinary and necessary for effective river management. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate and algae community assemblages; (ii) to determine the environmental variables that affect assemblage distributions; and (iii) to determine the suitability of the selected bioindicators in relation to environmental conditions. Two agriculturally influenced coastal rivers, in the southern Cape Province, South Africa, provided case studies. Wet and dry season’s results indicated that minimally impacted sites were associated with pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate and algal taxa with increased habitat scores. These sites were dominated by diatoms and macroinvertebrates indicative of low electrical conductivity (12–16 mS m−1), pH (4–5), and alkalinity (0.5–2.1 mg l−1). A positive correlation between nitrogen and phosphorus and river flow regime occurred at agriculturally impacted sites and algal taxa changes were driven by nutrient enrichment. Macroinvertebrates were indicative of habitat integrity and river condition while diatoms were indicative of pH and electrical conductivity. The benthic filamentous algae were indicative of increased nutrients and alkalinity. Results  suggest that the full consortium of algae and macroinvertebrates be used as bioindicators for ecological integrity assessments in short, coastal rivers, which have application to rivers generally."

abstract,"Abstract Environmental gradients and competition influence aquatic macrophyte distribution in estuaries. The competition-to-stress hypothesis states that some species are excluded from lower estuaries (high salinity) due to abiotic stress and others from upper estuaries (low salinity) by competition. The growth of Crinum americanum L. and Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in monoculture (10:0/0:10) and mixed culture (5:5) under different salinity levels (4/12/26) was analysed by a laboratory experiment (3 cultures × 3 sediment types × 3 replicate) to understand the role of competition and salinity on the distribution of these species in a tropical estuary as well as to verify whether the competition-to-stress hypothesis explains their zonation. We tested the hypothesis that S. alterniflora is not established in the upper estuary due to the effect of competition with C. americanum, whereas the latter presents restrictions to high salinity and has greater competitive ability in the upper estuary. Our data confirm the competition-to-stress hypothesis but not as proposed originally. We conclude that abiotic stress (low nutrient availability) is responsible for the absence of S. alterniflora in the upper estuary and that the competition between the two species is responsible for the absence of C. americanum in the lower estuary."

The 40 aquatic plant species were assessed using the US Aquatic Weed Risk Assessment (USAqWRA) scheme for each of the 16 South American regions, for a total number of 644 assessments and for South America (153 assessments). The method was benchmarked against expert opinion (invasive, non-invasive). We ranked 17 of them as naturalised, and 15 as invasive species in at least one South American region. The USAqWRA distinguished between non-invaders and invaders with an overall accuracy of 84.9% in South America and 54.1% in the 16 regions, with areas under the curves equal to 0.893 and 0.853, at a threshold score of 51.5 and 43.5, respectively. The study highlights that the USAqWRA could represent a suitable screening protocol to prioritise aquatic species that have the potential to cause negative impacts, prevent attempts of introduction and to manage risky aquatic plants in South America."

abstract,"Abstract Gross primary production and ecosystem respiration together define ecosystem metabolism and help indicate the importance of internal and external carbon sources. Spatial variability of these processes is poorly characterized in rivers. We measured metabolism in the Kansas River: (1) at 10 locations over 100 s of km in tributaries within the watershed and (2) over 20 km with detailed sampling in the main stem. Whole-river metabolism at the larger scale was decoupled from light, algal growth, and nutrient limitation, and was positively related to nutrients. Smaller-scale main stem sampling revealed almost as much variance over a few kilometers as the larger scale sampling. Local processes seemed to dominate dissolved oxygen dynamics, since diurnal dissolved oxygen patterns were better correlated with absolute time than data corrected for travel times. A single-station method compared against two-station metabolism methods indicated that local hotspots of metabolism occur at scales less than 1 km and that single-station estimates average out this variance. The main stem data provide support to the idea that functional processing zones control characteristics used to estimate system metabolism, but the nutrient effect at the whole watershed level indicates that transport from upstream can also be important."

Relatively few studies have focused on fresh waters, where biocalcifying species are more readily impacted by changes in pH. Sensitivity to pH of an endangered calcium-demanding organism, the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, was investigated in the Pinail nature reserve, a natural system with 3000 permanent ponds, some inhabited by the crayfish and others not, originally due to human introduction. From the 14 chemical parameters measured in this study, the main limiting factor preventing crayfish establishment appears to be water acidity (pH < 6.8), which affects calcification, molting, growth and reproduction. We predict that 20% of the Pinail populations will disappear by 2060 due to freshwater acidification with the present level of fossil fuel consumption. Ongoing and future restoration projects for conservation of this heritage crustacean must select hard water with the highest water pH (> 7)."

abstract,"Abstract Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) were used to examine trophic niche dynamics of three co-occurring predators in The Bahamas. Variable estimates of core trophic niche width and total trophic niche overlap were observed between nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), southern stingrays (Hypanus americanus), and Atlantic chupare stingrays (Styracura schmardae). Nurse sharks exhibited little trophic overlap with either species of stingray and exhibited higher δ15N values, suggesting limited potential resource competition. Southern and Atlantic chupare stingrays exhibited higher total trophic niche overlap, highlighting higher levels of resource competition. Nurse sharks exhibited the broadest δ13C range, implying utilization of multiple resource pools to facilitate energetic requirements, compared with southern stingrays and Atlantic chupare stingrays. Southern stingrays exhibited the smallest core trophic niche width, highlighting reliance upon a narrower range of resource pools, likely supported by a single habitat type. We postulate that the persistence of the three sub-sampled predator populations is supported by potential resource partitioning and utilization of multiple trophic resource pools. Further information regarding trophic niche dynamics and patterns of resource use is required for data-poor species to identify how populations and communities may respond to the adverse effects of exploitation, such as fisheries impacts, habitat alteration, and pollution."

abstract,"Abstract Submerged macrophytes growing in clear- and turbid water may develop morphological differences as adaptations to difference light levels. Plant forms altered over generations and longtime are regarded as ecotypes and the changes are assumed to be persistent, even if the plants are returned to their ancestral environment. Specimens of Potamogeton malaianus from clear and turbid water zones of Lake Taihu were compared in their native settings and after transplanting to similar and different environments. Results  showed that turbid water forms of P. malaianus had significantly larger shoots with more and longer leaves and more biomass concentrated near the water surface. After transplanting into clear water, the daughter shoots arising from clear or turbid water plants showed no significant differences from their mother shoots, but showed significant differences from each other. After transplanting into turbid water, mother and daughter shoots originating from turbid water plants had similar morphologies, but were significantly different from clear water plants. Plants transplanted from clear water did not survive in turbid water. Our results suggest that P. malaianus forms special ecotype in turbid water, which may help plants maximize their sunlight-harvesting potential and thus might contribute to an observed expansion of the species into turbid water areas of eutrophic lakes."

abstract,"Abstract Changes in zooplankton community structure and function were analyzed in 24 lakes covering a wide salinity gradient (from 0.5 to 115 g l−1) in a semiarid region in northwest China. We hypothesized that species richness (S), species diversity (H), functional diversity (FD), biomass, and size of zooplankton would decrease with increasing salinity. We found that S, H, and FD did decrease with increasing salinity, whereas zooplankton sizes, size range, and biomasses did not. In fact, the sizes of microcrustaceans were mainly regulated by the abundance of small fish. Besides the impoverishment of FD, the zooplankton functional groups also varied along the salinity gradient. A shift occurred from selective raptorial to more generalist microphagous rotifers, from selective to more generalist filter feeder cladocerans, and from dominance of microphagous herbivorous copepods to microphagous carnivores. Our study indicates that the ongoing salinization of lakes with climate warming will result in important changes in the zooplankton, affecting not only the structure but also the functioning of this community. A weakened top-down control by zooplankton on phytoplankton at moderate high salinities may be an indirect consequence, leading to a worsening of eutrophication symptoms. Loss of fish at high salinities may, however, counteract this effect."

abstract,"Abstract Aquatic plants fulfil a wide range of ecological roles, and make a substantial contribution to the structure, function and service provision of aquatic ecosystems. Given their well-documented importance in aquatic ecosystems, research into aquatic plants continues to blossom. The 14th International Symposium on Aquatic Plants, held in Edinburgh in September 2015, brought together 120 delegates from 28 countries and six continents. This special issue of Hydrobiologia includes a select number of papers on aspects of aquatic plants, covering a wide range of species, systems and issues. In this paper, we present an overview of current trends and future directions in aquatic plant research in the early twenty first century. Our understanding of aquatic plant biology, the range of scientific issues being addressed and the range of techniques available to researchers have all arguably never been greater; however, substantial challenges exist to the conservation and management of both aquatic plants and the ecosystems in which they are found. The range of countries and continents represented by conference delegates and authors of papers in the special issue illustrates the global relevance of aquatic plant research in the early twenty first century but also the many challenges that this burgeoning scientific discipline must address."

abstract,"Abstract Species distributions are structured by regional and local determinants, which operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of our work was to distinguish the relative roles of local variables, climate, geographical location and post glaciation condition (i.e., delineation between supra- and subaquatic lakes during the post-glacial Ancylus Lake) in explaining variation in macrophyte community composition of all taxa, helophytes and hydrophytes. In addition, we investigated how these four explanatory variable groups affected macrophyte strategy groups based on Grime’s classification. Using partial linear regression and variation partitioning, we found that macrophyte communities are primarily filtered by local determinants together with regional characteristics at the studied spatial scale. We further evidenced that post glaciation condition indirectly influenced on local water quality variables, which in turn directly contributed to the macrophyte communities. We thus suggest that regional determinants interact with local-scale abiotic factors in explaining macrophyte community patterns and examining only regional or local factors is not sufficient for understanding how aquatic macrophyte communities are structured locally and regionally."

abstract,"Abstract The role of herbivores in regulating aquatic plant dynamics has received growing recognition from researchers and managers. However, the evidence for herbivore impacts on aquatic plants is largely based on short-term exclosure studies conducted within a single plant growing season. Thus, it is unclear how long herbivore impacts on aquatic plant abundance can persist for. We addressed this knowledge gap by testing whether mute swan (Cygnus olor) grazing on lowland river macrophytes could be detected in the following growing season. Furthermore, we investigated the role of seasonal changes in water current speed in limiting the temporal extent of grazing. We found no relationship between swan biomass density in 1 year and aquatic plant cover or biomass in the following spring. No such carry-over effects were detected despite observing high swan biomass densities in the previous year from which we inferred grazing impacts on macrophytes. Seasonal increases in water velocity were associated with reduced grazing pressure as swans abandoned river habitat. Furthermore, our study highlights the role of seasonal changes in water velocity in determining the length of the mute swan grazing season in shallow lowland rivers and thus in limiting the temporal extent of herbivore impacts on aquatic plant abundance."

abstract,"Abstract The use of remote sensing for monitoring of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in fluvial environments has been limited by the spatial and spectral resolution of available image data. The absorption of light in water also complicates the use of common image analysis methods. This paper presents the results of a study that uses very high-resolution image data, collected with a Near Infrared sensitive DSLR camera, to map the distribution of SAV species for three sites along the Desselse Nete, a lowland river in Flanders, Belgium. Plant species, including Ranunculus peltatus, Callitriche obtusangula, Potamogeton natans L., Sparganium emersum R. and Potamogeton crispus L., were classified from the data using object-based image analysis and expert knowledge. A classification rule set based on a combination of both spectral and structural image variation (e.g. texture and shape) was developed for images from two sites. A comparison of the classifications with manually delineated ground truth maps resulted for both sites in 61% overall accuracy. Application of the rule set to a third validation image resulted in 53% overall accuracy. These consistent results not only show promise for species-level mapping in such biodiverse environments but also prompt a discussion on assessment of classification accuracy."

abstract,"Abstract  Hygraula nitens is a New Zealand native moth with aquatic larvae that feed on submerged aquatic plants. The larvae have been mainly observed using native Potamogeton and Myriophyllum species as a food source, although some studies reported larvae feeding on the alien macrophytes Hydrilla verticillata, Lagarosiphon major and Ceratophyllum demersum. Experimental mesocosm studies showed larvae had a major effect on H. verticillata, C. demersum, L. major, Elodea canadensis and Egeria densa. In both no choice and choice experiments H. nitens larvae showed a clear preference for and the highest consumption of C. demersum, while the native macrophyte Myriophyllum triphyllum ranked fourth out of five alien and two native plant species, indicating a preference of the larvae for alien macrophytes. Additional choice experiments using C. demersum, sampled from different waters in NZ, illustrated that there was a clear difference in H. nitens preference for plants based on their source. However although C. demersum had the lowest leaf dry matter content (LDMC) compared with the other macrophytes, neither the LDMC nor leaf carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus or total phenolic contents alone could explain the preferences of H. nitens, and we conclude that food choice is based on a combination of these and/or additional factors."

abstract,"Abstract Predator–prey interactions exist on a variety of spatial and temporal scales; one of the earliest measurable responses to changes in these interactions is behavior. We examined the behavior of southern California kelp forest predators in response to a concentrated increase in the abundance of abalone during a restoration stocking experiment. We tested three hypotheses: (1) kelp forest predator density will increase following abalone stocking, (2) variations in predator characteristics will create an unequal impact on abalone, and (3) predation intensity will be greatest early in the experiment. Octopus discovered and exploited the influx of prey within the first week following stocking; their densities surged and then returned to pre-stocking levels after 2 months. This was not observed with any other predator. Damage from crustacean, fish, and octopus predation was observed on the recovered abalone shells, but were not correlated with predator densities. A larger percentage of recovered small shells had evidence of crustacean and fish predation, indicating there may be size-specific impacts of predators on abalone. Our results demonstrate that restoration stocking experiments can quantitatively test the predatory community’s response to reintroductions, as well as predation risk of newly stocked prey species when exposed to a diverse suite of predators."

abstract,"Abstract Aquatic ecosystems depend on photosynthetic bacteria that use various strategies of adaptation to light quantity and quality; the qualitative strategies include far-red/near infrared (> 700 nm) light adaptations. The usage of > 700 nm light as energy source is disadvantageous for photosynthesis (long-wavelength quanta are poorer in energy than short-wavelength quanta, and such light is largely screened out by water). Nevertheless, some bacteria produce long-wavelength absorbing “red-shifted” chlorophylls (Chls) that extend the range of photosynthetically active radiation to the infrared region. The majority of cyanobacteria use 400–700 nm light, with excited state being ultimately entrapped by Chl a at a long-wavelength maximal absorbance of ~ 700 nm. This photoadaptation to far-red light was unknown until the discovery of strains producing Chls d and f in 1996 and 2010, respectively. Today, there is much data on cyanobacteria utilizing Chl d as their main pigment and many studies on accessory Chls d and/or f produced under exposure to far-red light. Further analysis of the photosynthetic apparatuses of cyanobacteria that produce red-shifted Chls will contribute to a better understanding of primary productivity in aquatic communities. In this review, we report on the diversity, distribution, physiological ecology, taxonomy and evolution of aquatic cyanobacteria producing red-shifted Chls."

abstract,"Abstract Ecosystem level effects of common (Cyprinus carpio) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have generally focused on adult life stages. The objective of our mesocosm study was to investigate and contrast the roles of juvenile common and bighead carp in structuring planktonic invertebrate assemblages, with focus on rotifers. We examined whether predation by juvenile carp was indiscriminate or size-selective with respect to prey size. Furthermore, we examined how changes to large and small prey influenced the potential for compensatory increases of some taxa within prey assemblages. Both species of juvenile carp reduced large zooplankton taxa. However, rotifer responses were variable depending on the taxon and predator combination. Juvenile common carp enhanced abundance for Polyartha and Squatinella, but most taxa were unaffected. Juvenile bighead carp had a more varied effect on rotifer abundance, having no effect on most, reducing Keratella and enhancing Anuraeopsis. We also estimated net filtration volume of the zooplankton community for each of the treatments and found partial compensation in net filtration because of the increased abundance of a few rotifer taxa, but this reduction did not match the depletion of macrozooplankton. Rotifers that benefitted from the presence of fish predators likely responded positively because of reduced predation by mesopredators, because of their short generation times, and/or from reduced competition."

abstract,"Abstract Our objective was to determine how different morphological traits of microalgae influence their settling rates, since settling is important to population dynamics and the loss of individuals affects phytoplankton communities. We hypothesized that different morphological characteristics can affect phytoplankton settling rate, and that surface to volume ratio (S:V) would be especially important in determining the settling rhythm than any other morphological trait alone. Experiments were conducted in settling columns, which generate subsamples for quantification of phytoplankton and allow the calculation of settling rate. The dependence of settling rate on various cell characteristics was assessed by predictive models generated by non-linear regression analyses in which settling rate was the independent variable, while the dependent variable was biovolume, surface area or S:V ratio. The resulting statistical coefficients were used to compare models in terms of their capacity to describe and predict settling. The results show that phytoplankton did not follow Stokes Law of particle settling. As expected, the model based on S:V ratio was the best predictor of phytoplankton settling rate. The balance between volume and surface was more important than each characteristic alone because although increasing volume could positively affect settling rates, surface area is fundamental to determine resistance to settling."

abstract,"Abstract Given the limited evidence on utilizing low-frequency electrical fields as deterrents to fish, we studied lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) behavioural responses and short-term physiological reactions to low-frequency (0.1–50 Hz) low-voltage (0.024–0.3 v) electric fields. Fish from 2 year classes were used as a means of including size considerations in the study. Individuals from both year classes exhibited differing responses to the same electric fields, with smaller, younger fish being more reactive to the electric stimulation of the fields than /older, larger fish. The smaller, younger fish also had reduced weight gain 30 days post experiment compared with fish that were a year older. Short-term physiological effects were observed in the older, larger fish in the form of elevated blood glucose levels. Our results show that individuals can acclimatize to electric fields in a relatively short time period and that larger individuals tend to be less affected by low-frequency/low-voltage electric fields than smaller fish. Testing the utility of electric deterrents in a more realistic riverine setting using pulsating electric field is, therefore, highly recommended to ensure decisions regarding the implementation of low-frequency/low-voltage electric barrier systems to reduce entrainment adequately account for possible sublethal effects on lake sturgeon."

This study tested the hypothesis that cell growth rate and Diarrethic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) toxin (okadaic acid, OA; dinophysistoxin 1, DTX1) per cell of the benthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima increases with temperature. P. lima cells were grown in f/2 medium at irradiances of 50 ± 15 µmol m−2 s−1 and photoperiod of 12 h L:12 h D. Cell abundance, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), and nutrient consumption (NO3− + NO2− and PO43−) were also determined. P. lima optimum growth temperature was at 15 and 25°C but the highest Fv/Fm values showed no association to the maximum growth rate. P. lima showed lower cell growth rates and Fv/Fm values at both 5 and 30°C. Only free OA concentration per cell showed an increase with temperature up to 15°C. Highest lipophilic toxicity in P. lima was found during the stationary growth phase at low (10–15°C) and elevated (30°C) temperatures. Results  from this study suggest that future changes to climatic conditions in coastal waters may lead to higher growth rates and cellular toxin levels in P. lima populations worldwide."

We hypothesized that physicochemical variables affecting assemblages would differ depending on altitude. The study was conducted in 46 plateau ponds and 21 mountain ponds. Our results revealed a shift in hydrophyte assemblage composition and structure along an altitude and water chemistry gradient. However, altitude was not a good predictor of species richness. Conductivity and nutrient concentrations were higher in plateau ponds than in mountain ponds and binary logistic regression showed that conductivity was the best variable for differentiating between both pond types. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that conductivity was the main factor responsible for the species distribution in both pond types. Generalized linear models showed that in plateau ponds, total phosphorus and mean depth were the strongest predictors of submerged macrophyte coverage, and no model could be created for richness. In the mountain ponds, conductivity and pond area explained coverage of submerged plants, while richness was related to pond area. Our results corroborated the hypothesis to be tested, and the conclusions obtained may be of relevance for making decisions on conservation and restoration."

abstract,"Abstract Aquatic plants may face resource constraints or anthropogenic pollution, and effects might be heightened under multiple stress conditions. We investigated if arsenate effects on Myriophyllum spicatum L. would be stronger under CO2 limitation and low phosphorus availability. In a factorial design, we exposed sediment-grown plants to either CO2 (high carbon or HC) or bicarbonate (low carbon or LC) and four levels of arsenate. We observed strong effects of arsenate exposure on growth, biomass allocation (leaf, stem and root mass fractions), pigments and phenolic compounds. CO2 availability strongly affected the content in phenolic compounds and a few other response variables, yet overall effects were less pronounced than expected. Strong interactive effects of CO2 availability and arsenic concentration were only observed for carotenoids, the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio and phenolic compounds in leaves. Only the carbon content declined with increasing arsenic concentration, otherwise leaf elemental content and stoichiometry were not affected by arsenic or CO2 availability, suggesting that plants strived to maintain leaf functions. The observed effects on biomass allocation and plant quality, specifically dry matter content and phenolic compound content of M. spicatum not only show direct changes in plant performance but suggest also indirect effects on ecological interactions such as competition or herbivory."

Concurrently to the biological monitoring, major ion geochemistry and turbidity were investigated on the same schedule. We found that the hydrochemistry did not govern the distribution pattern of the dominant taxon (Copepoda) into the Western Aurunci aquifer. In contrast, copepod drift showed clear differences in the number of individuals between the high and low water periods because of the “piston effect,” which is very frequent in karst and fractured aquifers due to recharge from rainfalls. According to the results of this study, groundwater species do not inhabit all sectors of a karst aquifer. They avoid the fast-flowing conduits where groundwater rapidly flows, while colonizing the more inertial aquifer sectors, such as the slow-flowing conduits."

abstract,"Abstract  Mediterranean watercourses are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide, being increasingly important to understand environmental drivers of biotic assemblages. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive picture of bryophyte communities in Mediterranean rivers and to determine the environmental factors that influence their distribution. We used floristic data collected for inter-calibration purposes under the European Water Framework Directive and River Habitat Survey, from 474 river reaches in six countries of the European Mediterranean basin. We analysed data through classification, ordination and environmental niche modelling techniques, and classified taxa according to biogeographic and aquatic habitat frameworks developed specifically for bryophytes. These analyses revealed four types of communities influenced by spatio-temporal precipitation patterns, altitude and water chemistry factors, most notably calcium and manganese. Community types are compositionally differentiated, although they share some core taxa and show an overall tendency to have several temperate and exclusively aquatic taxa despite the intermittent nature of water flow in highly seasonal Mediterranean rivers. The modelling approach can be improved at a more local scale when more bryological data and higher-resolution environmental information become available. Given future scenarios of climate change and human alteration of hydrological regimes, broader scales studies are needed to monitor shifts in bryophyte communities."

We quantified the effects of gizzard sand both on consumption of plant tissue and on snail growth and reproduction with a cross-gradient, 28-day laboratory experiment. We offered apical shoot sections of Myriophyllum spicatum (initial ash content ~ 56%) or soft lettuce (ash content ~ 19%, as control) to Lymnaea stagnalis previously reared on sand or without sand. Gizzard sand had no effect on snail growth but sand-reared snails fed with lettuce initially produced more eggs than their no-sand counterparts. Snails fed M. spicatum exhibited stunted growth and produced only one small egg clutch. Shell height at time of first oviposition of M. spicatum-fed snails was two-thirds of that of lettuce-fed controls. Snails initially appeared to feed on periphyton and older, brownish M. spicatum leaflet tips, but later turned to midstem tissue. Fresh apices were not consumed. Gizzard sand had a limited effect on the ability of L. stagnalis to consume living M. spicatum, with apices likely defended chemically (polyphenols) and midstem tissue defended structurally (high ash content)."

Therefore, we carried out a survey of 16 small (0.06–7.1 ha) and shallow (≤ 6.5 m) fishless lakes, above the treeline in the Ecuadorian Andes (≤ 3863 m). Our objectives were (a) to provide baseline data of representative lakes for future monitoring and research and (b) to identify environmental variables driving taxon richness and plankton biomass. We hypothesised that both would decline along the altitudinal gradient. A range of geographical, physical and chemical data and samples of phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic macrofauna were collected. We found that the lakes are cold, oligotrophic and have a low plankton diversity and biomass. We were able to show that altitude, depth, water chemistry and inflow of glacial meltwater are the most important variables controlling the lake biota. Furthermore, we identified two distinct types of lakes: highly turbid due to glacial runoff and clear watered lakes. These may represent different stages of lake development from newly formed, ultraoligotrophic pro-glacial lakes to oligotrophic páramo lakes."

abstract,"Abstract In coastal areas with a high intensity of human activities, expansion of artificial structures may enhance Aurelia spp. blooms because these constructions may provide additional substrates for the settlement and proliferation of the polyps. In the present study, the possible occurrence and distribution of Aurelia coerulea ephyrae and polyps were investigated in sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) culture ponds that contain huge amounts of artificial structures. Our results showed that A. coerulea ephyrae were widely distributed in the A. japonicus culture ponds along the Bohai and Yellow Seas. Furthermore, underwater photography revealed that polyps of A. coerulea mainly occurred on the undersides of the artificial reefs made by plastic sunshade nets, tiles and substrate cages. The artificial reefs may decrease the time A. coerulea planulae spend settling, provide more hidden, calm and shady places for the settlement and proliferation of A. coerulea planulae, and thus were suitable substrates for the moon jellyfish A. coerulea. Our study suggests that the A. japonicus culture ponds may act as nursery grounds for the jellyfish A. coerulea and may potentially enhance the blooms of this species in the coastal waters along the Bohai and Yellow Seas."

abstract,"Abstract The coral reef crisis has resulted in many reefs stabilizing in a low coral cover state, and this condition is exemplified by the fringing reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, where coral cover has remained low for decades. To evaluate the demographic features maintaining this condition, a decade of coral abundance was examined in three domains: recruits, small colonies (≤ 40-mm diameter), and cover. While cover was stable from 2007 to 2016, other aspects of coral community structure changed in taxonomically unique ways differing among domains. Most changes occurred gradually, although the warm year of 2010 was associated with perturbations in growth, mortality, and density that differed among domains and taxa, and summed to a weak signal distinguishing communities before and after ~ 2011/2012. As a result, coral community structure was taxonomically shuffled within each domain, while low cover was maintained. These low coral cover communities may be characterized by functional redundancy among taxa and a weakening of interactions among them that traditionally have supported emergent properties like community calcification. With persistent failure of recruitment to augment coral cover, some corals may already occur at such low abundances that they cannot perform the ecological services with which they were once associated."

abstract,"Abstract Pinna nobilis is an endangered species of fan mussel found along coastal Mediterranean waters requiring special attention for conservation. Populations are restricted in number, due to anthropogenic disturbances, disease, and in some areas, low rates of recruitment. To date, the difficulties associated with the identification of planktonic stages have prompted the use of benthic collectors as a proxy for quantifying larval supply, despite important information being lost regarding planktonic processes. We present evidence of spawning utilizing a qPCR assay developed for detecting genomic DNA of P. nobilis to enable specific identification of planktonic stages to augment knowledge of P. nobilis life history. In the Ebro Delta, Spain, it has been used to study what might be limiting their reproduction locally. We demonstrate the ability to differentiate DNA of P. nobilis from other bivalve mollusks and distinguish between fertilized and unfertilized eggs of P. nobilis, which may be a crucial point for understanding the low level of recruitment seen in this natural population. We also show evidence of larval presence during the expected spawning period, although abundance in positive samples were so low that they pose new questions about factors controlling the availability of planktonic stages of P. nobilis."

abstract,"Abstract Micro-estuaries and micro-outlets represent small coastal waterbodies that differ in their relative salinity and size, with the former being larger, more saline (mesohaline versus oligohaline), and exchanging with the sea more often than the latter. There are thousands of these waterbodies along the world’s coastline, yet few of these very small systems have been identified and studied. We investigated systematic differences between micro-estuaries and micro-outlets in terms of phytoplankton community composition, including spatio-temporal variation in both community structure and biomass (chlorophyll-a). A multivariate analysis was used to assess differences in environmental variables, biomass and phytoplankton community composition across four seasons and the two waterbody types. A total of 260 (63 families) and 244 (74 families) phytoplankton taxa were identified within the micro-estuaries and micro-outlets, respectively. Nano- and picoplankton were the dominant groups in micro-estuaries, and pico- and microplankton in micro-outlets. Micro-estuaries were rich in phytoplankton taxa representative of marine, estuarine and freshwater conditions, with a successional sequence in dominance evident, from Chlorophyta during winter to Bacillariophyta in spring and Cyanophyta in summer. By contrast, micro-outlets were mostly dominated by freshwater taxa, with Chlorophyta remaining the dominant group across all four seasons. Higher phytoplankton biomass was recorded during the winter when increased nutrients were available following catchment flooding. Seasonal switching in phytoplankton was reflected not only in changing dominance patterns in both habitat types but also in complete replacement of some species in micro-outlets, despite Chlorophyta remaining dominant. Such temporal turnover, which is often accompanied by predictable seasonal changes in environmental conditions, can promote overall species richness by allowing more taxa to coexist in a single environment through temporal niche segregation."

abstract,"Abstract We summarise current understanding of consumer recycling in lake nutrient cycles and expand on it by integrating emerging knowledge from food web ecology. The role of consumer nutrient recycling (CNR) is initially framed in the wider context of lake nutrient cycling, which includes hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes, and their responses to global environmental change. Case studies are used to demonstrate that effects of CNR on lake ecosystems range widely, from reduced nutrient cycling rates to exacerbation of eutrophication. CNR depends on consumer biomass, body size and diet, remaining relatively consistent through the year and becoming important as other fluxes seasonally ebb. Universal patterns in food web structure, for example, consumer–resource biomass ratios, body size scaling and relationships between trophic level and diet breadth, are used to demonstrate the predictability of CNR effects. Larger, mobile, top predators excrete nutrients at a lower rate but over a wider range, linking nutrient cycles across habitats. Smaller-bodied, lower trophic level consumers have strong localised nutrient cycling effects associated with their limited mobility. Global environmental-change drivers that alter food web structure are likely to have the greatest impact on CNR rates and should direct future studies."

abstract,"Abstract From the 1950s onwards, programmes to promote aquaculture and improve capture fisheries in East Africa have relied heavily on the promise held by introduced species. In Tanzania these introductions have been poorly documented. Here we report the findings of surveys of inland water bodies across Tanzania between 2011 and 2017 that clarify distributions of tilapiine cichlids of the genus Oreochromis. We identified Oreochromis from 123 sampling locations, including 14 taxa restricted to their native range and three species that have established populations beyond their native range. Of these three species, the only exotic species found was blue-spotted tilapia (Oreochromis leucostictus), while Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Singida tilapia (Oreochromis esculentus), which are both naturally found within the country of Tanzania, have been translocated beyond their native range. Using our records, we developed models of suitable habitat for the introduced species based on recent (1960–1990) and projected (2050, 2070) East African climate. These models indicated that presence of suitable habitat for these introduced species will persist and potentially expand across the region. The clarification of distributions provided here can help inform the monitoring and management of biodiversity, and inform policy related to the future role of introduced species in fisheries and aquaculture."

abstract,"Abstract Extensive transfer of tilapia between lakes throughout East Africa has often led to hybridisation with indigenous fish populations. The endemic Oreochromis hunteri of Lake Chala, an isolated crater lake near Mount Kilimanjaro, is potentially susceptible to introgression from a species formerly identified as Oreochromis korogwe, introduced ~ 30 years ago. We combined whole-body geometric morphometry on 104 specimens of both taxa with molecular phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial loci from 15 O. hunteri and 9 O. cf. korogwe specimens to assess whether hybridisation has occurred. Using fishes from Lake Jipe and Nyumba ya Mungu reservoir, we expanded our analysis to all four Oreochromis species currently inhabiting the Upper Pangani River system to determine the closest relative of O. hunteri, and hence the possible source population of the ancestral species that colonised Lake Chala. Our results indicate no interbreeding occurs between O. hunteri and O. cf. korogwe, and suggest O. jipe to be the closest living relative of O. hunteri. The introduced O. cf. korogwe is a phenotypically uniform but genetically variable population, the identity of which remains unknown. The high haplotype diversity of O. hunteri is consistent with fossil evidence indicating that its ancestor colonised Lake Chala at least 25,000 years ago."

abstract,"Abstract Physical, chemical and biological processes facilitate cross-habitat connections in lakes, prompting food webs to be supported by different subsidies. We tested the hypothesis that the pelagic food web is subsidized by littoral resources and fish foraging behaviour plays a major role in carbon flux and on food web structure in shallow hypereutrophic lakes. We performed a fish diet and carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses to predict the linkage between littoral and pelagic habitats in three shallow hypereutrophic lakes. Lakes differed in morphology, fetch, macrophyte composition and width of the littoral zone. δ13C signals of seston differed among lakes, but were similar to other producers. Macroinvertebrates and fish carbon signatures were more enriched in the lake co-dominated by emergent and submerged vegetation. Fish foraging behaviour indicates that more than the 80% of the carbon that sustain adult fish was channelled from the littoral. In conclusion, littoral carbon were relevant and sustain, in part, food web in these shallow lakes. Factors like the extension of the littoral zone, lake morphometry, and the dominance of multi-chain omnivorous fish facilitate the connection among lake compartments and the transference of littoral carbon to lake food web."

abstract,"Abstract The genus Mytilopsis includes some of the most invasive estuarine bivalves in the world, and M. leucophaeata (native to the Gulf of Mexico) and M. sallei (indigenous in the Caribbean Sea) are the most often reported species. Molecular investigations of the COI gene in invasive populations of M. leucophaeata in Europe found only one haplotype, whereas the invasive M. sallei in Asia had high haplotype diversity. The present study investigated COI variability of invasive populations previously identified as M. leucophaeata in Brazil, located at the cities of Recife and Rio de Janeiro. Our genetic analysis revealed that the record of M. leucophaeata from Recife appears erroneous; this population forms a clade adjacent to but genetically separated from the Asian M. cf. sallei. Similarly, samples from Rio de Janeiro clustered close to but not within European/North American sequences of M. leucophaeata. The Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery test suggested the existence of three species: M. leucophaeata, M. cf. sallei (Asia), and M. cf. sallei (Recife), which merit confirmation with nuclear DNA sequences. The discovery of two lineages of Mytilopsis in Brazil augments concerns about their expansion."

abstract,"Abstract In attempts to mitigate habitat degradation, coastal restoration practices have increasingly been developed. Many restoration practices, such as the introduction of freshwater or seawater, depend on improving the physical conditions in the degraded coastal salt marshes. The effectiveness of restoration practice is the most important focus of coastal wetland managers and ecologists. Here, we explored the effectiveness of irrigation with either freshwater or seawater in achieving re-vegetation on degraded bare flats in the Yellow River Delta through a controlled field experiment and greenhouse experiments. Our results showed that the re-establishment of plant seedlings could occur on bare flats when the two essential thresholds are exceeded. Seawater irrigation was less effective than freshwater because of the failure of the former to meet the salinity threshold for seed germination. It was harder to re-establish seedlings on the bare flats in the supratidal uplands, compared to bare flats in the middle and high marsh, because of the initial high soil salinity and low moisture content, which exceeded the tolerance thresholds of the seeds of several salt marsh species. Information on soil factor thresholds can predict the effectiveness of restoration efforts, an achievement which is instructive for future restoration efforts on bare flats."

abstract,"Abstract The arrival of the rains and the hydrological changes they cause are essential in the reproductive cycle of Neotropical migratory fishes, but their association with the onset of migration is still poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the role played by rainfall, hydrological changes, and the lunar cycle as triggers for migration of Prochilodus costatus (Prochilodontidae) in the upper São Francisco River, Brazil. In total, 132 individuals were fitted with radiotelemetry transmitters over three consecutive spawning seasons. Spawning migration began with the onset of the rains from late September to mid-December. Individuals exhibited a strong preference for initiating migration at the beginning of the rainy season, when river discharge is low, in days with positive changes in water level, and at times of new or waxing moon. The fraction of the population that initiates migration each year appears to be dependent on rainfall, indicating that P. costatus may be a partial migrant. The results show that P. costatus and, possibly, other migratory Neotropical fish, rely on different but interconnected environmental cues to trigger their spawning migration, ensuring that individuals migrate in time to reach their spawning grounds and find appropriate environmental conditions for spawning."

abstract,"Abstract The Blue Lagoon is a shallow geothermal lake which contains sea- and freshwater and is extremely high in silica content. This study has provided the first in-depth molecular survey of its planktic microbial inhabitants and laid the groundwork for future environmental and physiological work. Most MiSeq sequences obtained were affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria (36%), Cyanobacteria (26%), and Gammaproteobacteria (24%). Cyanobacteria were found to be the principal primary producers with 99.8% of the cyanobacterial sequences belonging to the unicellular Cyanobacterium aponinum. Filamentous genera: Halomicronema and Phormidium were very minor and present only outside the bathing area. The calculated diversity was typical of samples from extreme environments. Elevated salinity and high concentration of silicium attract extremophiles that are either highly adapted specialists for certain conditions or generalists with wide tolerance ranges. Relatively few abundant phyla were represented; 95% of observed OTUs consisted of less than ten sequences and only 0.5% had more than 1000 sequences. All rarefaction curves were far from saturation and a higher number of sequences is apparently required to cover the whole community diversity. Although, the diversity of the abundant taxa was limited, the rare biosphere, detectable only with next generation sequencing, increased significantly the diversity."

abstract,"Abstract The global importance of cyanobacteria is well known from their worldwide distribution and abundance as well as their contribution to atmospheric oxygen. In spite of a long history of cyanobacterial research in microbiology and botany, only a small portion of their high diversity has been recovered and only recently been addressed by molecular and phylogenetic methods. Controversies in traditional and modern approaches to cyanobacterial taxonomy still persist, which has stimulated their discussion within the 20th IAC Symposium. In this special section, we present a set of nine contributions, selecting the most interesting outcomes of the meeting. The molecular approaches applied deal on one hand, with classical single and multilocus phylogenetic taxonomy methods, on the other hand with high-throughput next generation sequencing methods to rapidly identify diversity of cyanobacteria in environmental samples without the possibility to investigate their taxonomic status in depth. The studied ecosystems include a variety of freshwater, brackish and marine, planktonic and benthic habitats from which cyanobacteria were sampled. Study regions comprise temperate, arctic, alpine and tropical environments from four continents. We discuss the salient points of the contributions from this volume and formulate four main issues from which conclusions are drawn in order to contribute to future progress in cyanobacterial research."

abstract,"Abstract The taxonomic criteria for cyanobacteria were substantially changed with the introduction of electron microscopy and molecular analyses. The system must be modified according to the results following from these studies and the genetic diversification in various clades must be used as an obligatory basic method for cyanobacterial classification. However, cytomorphological and ecological data cannot be neglected. It is necessary to discover always the relations, correlations, interactions, and coincidences between the genetic basis and morphological and ecological markers. They can have various taxonomic values in various clades and their importance must be re-evaluated in different taxa, but they cannot be omitted. Therefore, cryptic, morpho-, and ecospecies also appear based on different kinds and combinations of characters. The “polyphasic approach” is a methodological procedure that has been a means of dealing with all these problems. From this approach, the modern cyanobacterial system resulted in which numerous genera were divided into more generic entities, as well as making problematic the use of some traditional expressive characters, such as unicellularity vs. filamentous forms, the presence of sheaths, type of branching, presence of aerotopes, etc. The nomenclatural rules for phototrophic organisms must be respected even in this new system."

abstract,"Abstract The importance of sampling effort in the statistical exploration of spatial autocorrelation is demonstrated for benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages within the intertidal warm-temperate Knysna estuary, South Africa. While the role of spatial scale in determining autocorrelation patterns in ecological populations has been noted, the effects of changing sampling effort (e.g., sample size) have rarely been explored; neither have the nature of any changes with sample size. Invertebrate assemblages were sampled from a single grid lattice comprised of 48 sampling stations at four sample sizes (0.0015, 0.0026, 0.0054 and 0.01 m2). Four metrics were investigated: assemblage abundance, frequency (species density), and numbers of the two most abundant species in the area Simplisetia erythraeensis and Prionospio sexoculata. Spatial autocorrelation was estimated for each sample size from the global Moran’s I. For a range of distance classes, Moran’s I correlograms were constructed, these plotted autocorrelation estimates as a function of the separation distance between point samples. Spatial autocorrelation was present in three of the metrics (assemblage abundance frequency and Prionospio abundance), but not for Simplisetia abundance. The estimated magnitude of spatial autocorrelation varied across sampling units for all four assemblage and species metrics (global Moran’s I ranged from 0.5 to − 0.07). Correlograms indicated that optimal sampling interval distances fell in the region of 8 m for Simplisetia and 19 m for the remaining three metrics. These distances indicate the dimensions of the processes (both biotic and abiotic) that determine spatial patterning in the microbenthic intertidal invertebrates sampled."

abstract,"Abstract The introduction and spread of non-native species represents a significant threat to freshwaters. Non-native Pomacea are a recent and detrimental gastropod invader, altering habitats, biodiversity, and ecological function. Despite large size, adult Pomacea spp. may be cryptic but their egg masses, which are species specific in color and size, appear useful in determining presence and spatial distribution within invaded areas. We used a combination of annual (2013–2016) and monthly (April 2016–March 2017) shoreline transect surveys to determine the distribution of Pomacea spp. egg masses, along with habitat and water quality data, in Lake Seminole, GA, USA. Surveys identified invasive P. maculata and native P. paludosa, and provided evidence for rapid dispersal of P. maculata. Egg masses of both species occupied a wide range of emergent surfaces across the lake. Physicochemical measures suggest elevated specific conductivity corresponds with Pomacea presence. Temperature correlated with monthly variation of egg mass; however, egg masses were observed at water temperatures of 11.3 °C, below reported limits. Pomacea maculata dispersal throughout Lake Seminole is rapid, and shoreline classification and physicochemical conditions are influencing the on-going dispersal. Continued expansion of this invasive herbivore could have ecosystem-level consequences in Lake Seminole and other invaded waters across the southeast US."

abstract,"Abstract Based on a distribution database brought together for the recently published Atlas of the European dragonflies and damselflies, we describe the patterns of diversity and endemism of these insect groups. Highest species richness, as well as richness of predominantly lentic species, occurs in central and western-central Europe. Strictly lotic species have their centre of diversity in southwest France and parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The highest number of endemic species is found in southwest France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. A comparison of the diversity patterns of Odonata species listed in the EU Habitats Directive with those listed in the European Red List highlights a strong mismatch between species threatened in Europe, which are mainly found in the Mediterranean, and species legally protected by the European Union, which are concentrated in central and western Europe. This mismatch has a historical origin, as the species listed in the Habitats Directive were mostly selected in the 1970s and 1980s when water quality in western and central Europe was poor. Since the 1990s, water and habitat quality has improved in these parts of Europe while in the same period the pressure on aquatic habitats in the Mediterranean has increased greatly."

abstract,"Abstract Phytoplankton communities respond rapidly to environmental selection at a given locality, and they are also shaped by spatial processes at certain scales. The extracted effect of environmental selection and spatial processes may vary if different classification approaches are applied to phytoplankton and the spatial scales. In this study, summer phytoplankton of 43 lakes from three major lake regions in China were investigated and phytoplankton were classified with three approaches: taxonomy of species, habitat template-based functional groups, and morphology-based functional groups. Within a single lake region, the pattern of phytoplankton meta-community was significantly explained by environmental but not by spatial variables. In a larger scale covering all the three lake regions, both environmental and spatial variables explained the variance of the phytoplankton community, but the spatial variables were detected only by classification with species, and only the environmental variables were detected with phytoplankton functional groups. This study revealed that although vegetative populations of different species sorted into the same functional group have common response to environmental changes, their dispersal abilities, mechanisms, and strategies might differ markedly and therefore the species-specific approach cannot be disregarded when studying phytoplankton patterns at spatial scales."

Especially in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ), a potential deep-sea mining area, they grow on polymetallic nodules or on the surrounding sediment. We investigate hexactinellids from the CCFZ to understand the ecological aspects of deep-sea mining and support the development of future pre-mining risk assessments and monitoring actions. Therefore, this study is published as part of a series of studies, all focusing on deep-sea glass sponges from the CCFZ. Resolving genetic relationships between species is still a fundamental as well as challenging task. Especially understudied groups mostly lack resolution. Combining results derived from taxonomic and phylogenetic data gives deeper insights into glass sponge relationships. Here, we present (1) a set of new primers for sequencing mitochondrial 16S rDNA as well as nuclear 18S and 28S rDNA of glass sponges, (2) first DNA sequencing data for 6 hexactinellid genera and 19 species, as well as (3) the most comprehensive phylogenetic tree of hexactinellid sponges to date including data available from previous studies."

abstract,"Abstract Arctic ocean environments are receiving increasing attention, due to the rapid thinning and recession of marine sea ice caused by climate change. The present study characterizes the structure and chlorophyll a (Chl a) of summer microphytoplankton communities in western Arctic Ocean surface layers, in terms of species composition, periodical succession, geographic distribution, community types, abundance, and Chl a variation during the Fourth Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE, July–September, 2010). Possible effects of environmental forces on microphytoplankton communities were analyzed, and associations with water masses and sea-ice retreat were assessed. Results  show high species diversity in surface microphytoplankton communities, with significant geographic and temporal zonation relative to taxonomic composition, species abundance, and Chl a. A total of 153 taxa were identified, distributed among 68 genera of 9 phyla, and cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling showed a continual distribution of a distinct shelf assemblage and deep basin assemblage. Average abundance (892.7 × 102 cells/l), Chl a (1.63 mg/m3), species diversity (2.54), and species richness (19) were established for the shelf assemblage, with dominant species ranked as Navicula pelagica Cleve, Thalassiosira nordenskiöeldii Cleve, Chaetoceros diadema (Ehrenberg) Gran, Leptocylindrus danicus Cleve, Pseudo-nitzschia seriata (Cleve) H. Peragallo, Cylindrotheca closterium (Ehrenberg) Reimann & Lewin, Nitzschia longissima (Brébisson) Ralfs, and Navicula vanhoeffenii Gran. It is of note that a succession from pennate to centric diatom was accompanied by a significantly decreased amplitude of abundance and Chl a, between the inbound and the return voyage across the Chukchi shelf. Comparatively, deep basin assemblage displayed lower values of abundance (27.7 × 102 cells/l), Chl a (0.12 mg/m3), species diversity (2.49), and species richness (11), and the community was dominated by Thalassionema nitzschioides Grunow and Navicula pelagica Cleve. Silicate and nitrate concentrations were major factors that affected abundance and Chl a variability in both Pearson correlation analysis and canonical correspondence analysis, while the dynamics of oceanic circulation and sea-ice retreat affected summer microphytoplankton community assembly and fluctuations in the surface layer of the western Arctic Ocean."

abstract,"Abstract Tidal flats are extremely dynamic habitats in several environmental parameters, which enforces severe selection on their microbial inhabitants. Despite good knowledge of the species present, little is known about the temporal dynamics of their communities. Aim of the study was the investigation of cyanobacterial populations in intertidal flats of the German Wadden Sea and their seasonal- and sediment-type related dynamics of community composition based on next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA fragments. Most of the detected cyanobacterial taxa were present throughout the year, but with changing distribution patterns in different sediment types suggesting migration processes between sediment types during the year. Seasonal as well as tidal changes of environmental conditions and the heterogeneity of the study site concerning grain-size and related parameters created a temporally and spatially highly dynamic ecosystem. Development of microbial mats and community composition was mainly influenced by seasons. The annual mat growth started in spring and reached its maximum in late summer with highest richness as well-stabilized laminated structure. Different grain-sizes provided alternative niches for present taxa when conditions change. Coleofasciculus, Hydrocoleum, and Lyngbya were dominating genera in all sediment types. Βeta diversity of seasonal groups was influenced by the interval between sampling dates."

abstract,"Abstract The clam Rangia cuneata, originating from the Gulf of Mexico, was recorded in the Vistula Lagoon for the first time in the early 2010s, and quickly became the dominant component of the zoobenthic biomass. To assess mortality as a factor potentially controlling the growth of Rangia population, a year-long field experiment involving marked bivalves placed in sediment-filled trays deployed on the bottom was conducted in 2014 and 2015. Predator-induced mortality of the clams was low in summer, and very high in the winter–spring period. It was inversely proportional to the size of the clams. Such changes can be partially attributed to predation from at least five fish and three duck species, which contained clams in their digestive tracts. Non-predatory mortality particularly affected large individuals, and was highest in spring, several weeks after the end of winter. We hypothesize that it could be caused by persistent low temperatures over several winter months which led to considerable weakening of the condition of clams. A long winter could also reduce their resistance to environmental stress and potential effect of epibionts, as well as increase susceptibility to predation."

abstract,"Abstract  Sphaerocavum is a typical planktonic coccoid cyanobacterium that co-occurs with Microcystis species, and it is commonly found in blooms. Sphaerocavum is a morphogenus distinguishable from Microcystis, as it presents hollow colonies and two-plane cell division. However, Sphaerocavum phylogenetic position based on marker gene(s) has not yet been established. Here, we combined morphological and molecular analyses to address the taxonomic and phylogenetic placement of Sphaerocavum isolated from Brazilian eutrophic lakes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Sphaerocavum and Microcystis clustered together in a well-established clade, thus not supporting the Sphaerocavum designation as a divergent genus. The type strain and isolated lineages from Brazilian tropical regions were grouped in the ITS phylogenetic analysis apart from other Microcystis strains. As such, although the infrageneric recognition of Microcystis by molecular markers is still unclear, our analyses strongly indicate that Sphaerocavum must be considered as a morphotype of Microcystis. Thus, taking together our morphological and molecular analyses, we propose the inclusion of Sphaerocavum within the genus Microcystis. In addition, we suggest that the strains used in this study should be named as Microcystis brasiliensis (Azevedo & Sant’Anna) Rigonato et al. comb. nov., with CCIBt3094 as the type strain."

abstract,"Abstract Hardwater streams often contain deposits of calcium carbonate (travertine, tufa) supporting well-defined communities of cyanobacteria. Deposition of carbonate crusts is inhibited by moderate levels (c.100 μg/l) of dissolved orthophosphate phosphorus that can result in their loss, along with their cyanobacteria. Thirteen English cyanobacterium crust communities were investigated and in all but one, orthophosphate levels were too low to influence carbonate deposition. At one site, inhibitory levels of orthophosphate were found, and here, crusts have not been recorded for over 40 years. Phosphorus was detected in both the inorganic (CaCO3) and organic fractions of the crusts, and in the latter, it was highest in the living cyanobacterium mat. No interaction between the phosphorus in these two fractions was observed. Levels of total phosphorus in the crusts were positively correlated with orthophosphate in the water. The great majority of English lowland waters currently contain inhibitory levels of dissolved orthophosphate preventing the development of these communities over large tracts of the country. Estimates of the uptake of phosphorus by the cyanobacteria suggested that their growth would not significantly influence the inhibition of precipitation of the associated calcium carbonate."

abstract,"Abstract A recent study based on DNA taxonomy indicated that the widespread rotifer Keratella cochlearis comprises several evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). Identification of ESUs based on DNA taxonomy alone is problematic and usually requires morphological, demographic, and/or ecological evidence. We isolated three haplotypes belonging to two ESUs of K. cochlearis and conducted life table experiments to investigate if this genetic diversity is reflected in demography. We found significant differences between haplotypes in life history traits (average lifespan, number of offspring, and percent of rejected eggs) and in demographic parameters (instantaneous growth rate, generation time, and net reproductive rate of the populations). During the experiments, all the haplotypes produced abnormal females with a deformed lorica, which was never reported before in K. cochlearis. We also report the first case of an amphoteric female (producing both females and males) in K. cochlearis. We hypothesize that K. cochlearis haplotypes and thus ESUs may exhibit niche differentiation through their different life histories. The link between demographic parameters of K. cochlearis and niche utilization requires further research."

abstract,"Abstract Estuarine fisheries productivity is dependent upon numerous factors, including the productivity of primary producers supporting the food web and the transport of organic matter derived from those primary producers. In this study, we use stable isotope ratios in a Bayesian mixing model to estimate the contribution of primary producers to fully recruited commercial species in two important estuarine commercial fisheries in south-eastern Australia; the Hunter and Clarence estuaries. The C4 saltmarsh plant Sporobolus virginicus had the greatest contribution to consumer diet among almost all sites and times (25–95%), though for prawns the presence of seagrass may be exerting some influence on this calculated contribution in the Clarence estuary. Particulate organic matter (POM; 30%) and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM; 39–41%) also contributed significantly to consumer diet. Mangroves and other C3 sources generally had the lowest contribution to consumers (1–31%). While the exact contributions of each source are uncertain within our Bayesian framework, these results highlight the relatively large role of saltmarsh habitat as a contributor to fishery productivity, especially in estuaries with no seagrasses. Given the anthropogenic threats to saltmarsh habitat, there is potential for loss of fishery productivity with further loss of saltmarsh areal extent."

abstract,"Abstract In this study, we aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of the picocyanobacterium Synechococcus, an important contributor to primary production in many freshwater lakes. Our study sites were four lakes with different trophic states within the Osterseen Lake District in Southern Germany. Flow cytometry counts and next-generation sequencing were used from April to October 2015 to analyse the occurrence of Synechococcus and heterotrophic prokaryotes in relation to physical and chemical habitat properties. Synechococcus was identified as the main representative of the autotrophic picoplankton, but cell counts varied widely. The Synechococcus taxa identified by flow cytometry were confirmed by sequencing data, but the comparison of the flow cytometry counts and sequence data revealed discrepancies for cells in the exponential phase. The eutrophic Lake Schiffhuettensee was dominated by algae and had the highest abundance of heterotrophic prokaryotes. The presence of distinct operational taxonomic units of Synechococcus varied seasonally and was lake-specific, indicating local niche adaptation. Our study sheds light on the ecology of these important primary producers in freshwater systems. Furthermore, the discrepancy observed with the direct comparison of the widely used methods of next-generation sequencing and flow cytometry should serve as a caveat for future data analysis."

abstract,"Abstract Changes in land use often increase nutrient loading to aquatic ecosystems, affecting primary productivity and water quality, with flow-on effects to consumers. We explored whether fish-assemblage composition, species diversity, and the representation and richness of ecological guilds were associated with catchment land use in 31 estuaries in Victoria, Australia. Fish assemblages were surveyed using fyke and gill nets. Species were assigned to ecological guilds based on salinity associations and their use of estuaries, water column position and trophic characteristics. The Shannon diversity index, representation and richness of several marine-associated species and trophic guilds dominated by marine-associated species were positively related to tidal exchange, indicating the widespread influence of marine connectivity on estuarine fish assemblage and trophic structure. These patterns were driven by adult life stages. The richness and the proportion of demersal species in juvenile assemblages were negatively associated with the proportion of the catchment with land uses expected to elevate nutrient loads (e.g. animal production, horticulture, industry and urbanization). This relationship may reflect shifts in vegetated habitat, resource availability or changes in water quality induced by nutrient enrichment. Juvenile demersal fish show promise as an indicator of the effects of catchment land use on the structure of estuarine fish assemblages."

abstract,"Abstract In order to understand Chamaesiphon spp. evolution and ecological diversification, we investigated the phylogenetic differentiation of three morphospecies from field samples by means of single colony genetics. Individual colonies of three different morphospecies (C. starmachii, C. polonicus, C. geitleri,) were isolated from lotic gravel streams and their 16S rDNA nucleotide variability was analyzed. For a number of individual colonies, microscopical and ultrastructural analysis was also performed. A phylogenetic tree of all major lineages of the phylum of Cyanobacteria assigned all Chamaesiphon genotypes (1149–1176 bp) most closely with the family of Gomontiellaceae of the order Oscillatoriales. The sequences obtained from colonies assigned to C. starmachii (n = 21), C. polonicus (n = 9), and C. geitleri (n = 17) were found to reveal high average (3.5%) nucleotide diversity. No phylogenetic sub-branching in correspondence with morphology was observed suggesting that the three Chamaesiphon morphospecies did not represent monophyletic taxa. We could not attribute specific thylakoid ultrastructure to phylogenetic sub-branches; however, the observed parietally and loosely arranged thylakoids indicate that for the genus Chamaesiphon, the variability in thylakoid ultrastructure might have been underestimated. In summary, the high nucleotide diversity of the 16S rDNA gene implies phylogenetic diversity that corresponds little to morphological classification."

abstract,"Abstract Despite the global significance of cyanobacteria, their taxonomy is still heavily lagging behind the progress in genome sequencing. Besides nomenclatural issues and difficulties in species identification, this problem is largely a consequence of missing reference strains and sequences for many cyanobacterial taxa. In this study, a robust multilocus phylogenetic tree based on 23 conserved proteins from the current set of available genomes is presented and compared to a respective 16S rRNA gene tree. To facilitate further progress in achieving a stable system of monophyletic taxa, the phylogenetic status of eight cyanobacterial orders recently proposed in the botanical system was evaluated. While several orders addressed by previous studies (Gloeobacterales, Spirulinales, Chroococcidiopsidales, Nostocales) retain their monophyly, the remaining big groups (Synechococcales, Pleurocapsales, Chroococcales, Oscillatoriales) are polyphyletic and require thorough revision. Comparison of the 16S rRNA tree to the multilocus tree supports the careful use of this gene in distinguishing cyanobacterial genera, whereas its application at other taxonomic levels is limited."

abstract,"Abstract The widely distributed snail species Theodoxus fluviatilis (Linneaus, 1758) is rather diverse in shell size and patterning. It has formed regional subgroups in northern Germany that appear separate in either fresh- or brackish water, yet, according to literature, are indistinguishable by morphology, anatomy or mtRNA markers. Tolerance towards challenging salinities, however, is distinct. The question as to whether the observed difference in salinity tolerance is a result of local adaptation or of phenotypic plasticity remains. In this study, physiological limits to salinity stress and tolerance shift abilities were compared between individuals from both subgroups in a salinity transfer experiment and acclimation regime followed by a survival analysis. Brackish water animals struggled in freshwater but performed much better than freshwater individuals when directly transferred into higher salinities. With acclimation to their challenging salinities, individuals of both subgroups achieved shifts in the slopes of their reaction norms and were able to survive salinity levels otherwise lethal to them. Even with this shift freshwater animals were not able reach the tolerance levels of brackish water individuals. The results indicate that phenotypic plasticity as well as genetic adaptation may determine osmotolerance in regional subgroups of T. fluviatilis."

abstract,"Abstract Megalonaias is the most geographically widespread genus of the subfamily Ambleminae and is distributed across much of the eastern half of North America, from Minnesota to Nicaragua. Despite the large geographic distribution, the species-level diversity of Megalonaias is quite depauperate (2 spp.), suggesting the genus may not be constrained by the same physical, ecological, or physiological barriers that limit dispersal in many other amblemines. However, this hypothesis is contingent on the assumption that the current taxonomy of Megalonaias accurately reflects its evolutionary history, which remains incompletely understood due to the marginalization of Mesoamerican populations in systematic research. Using one mitochondrial (COI) and one nuclear marker (ITS1) sequenced from 41 individuals distributed across both the Nearctic and Mesoamerican ecoregions, we set out to better understand the species boundaries and genetic diversity within Megalonaias. The reconstructed molecular phylogeny and the observed genetic diversity suggests that Megalonaias is a monotypic genus and that Megalonaias nickliniana, currently considered a federally endangered species, is not a valid species. These results are discussed in the context of their systematic and conservation implications, as well as how the unusual life history strategy of Megalonaias may be influencing its molecular diversity."

The Murmansk region (359 species), Spitsbergen archipelago (314), and Bolshezemelskaya tundra (191) have the highest number of species among the studied territories. The flora is unevenly studied in different areas of the Arctic, and therefore, it is too early to suggest any significant specificity of the algal flora to particular areas."

abstract,"Abstract Deep-sea benthic environments can be home to diverse communities of corals and sponges which are important habitat for marine fishes and invertebrates. From 2010 to 2014, underwater camera surveys in the Aleutian Islands were completed with the objective of evaluating potential effects of substrate type, tidal currents, depth, and fishing pressure on distribution, abundance, diversity, and size of structure-forming invertebrate (SFI) communities. The presence of rocky substrates was associated with higher probability of presence, higher density, and taller SFI. Multivariate analyses showed community structure changed over gradients of substrate, tidal currents, and longitude, with sea whips typically occupying deeper depths and mostly unconsolidated substrates, while other corals were largely found in rocky, shallower areas. These patterns were also reflected in co-occurrence analyses indicating sea whips were negatively associated with other SFI taxa. Most SFI occupied areas of swift tidal currents; however, heights of individual SFI decreased with increasing tidal currents. Coral and sponge densities at some sites in this study exceeded densities reported from other global coral and sponge habitats. Identifying the environmental conditions leading to high-density and high-diversity SFI communities is important for management of fisheries and evaluating potential impacts of climate change in benthic marine ecosystems."

abstract,"Abstract We present a sediment record from Lugu Lake, a large and deep alpine lake in southwestern China, spanning the last c.2500 cal yr BP. This multi-proxy study focussed on subfossil chironomids but also included analyses of chemical elements using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and grain size. The chironomid assemblage is dominated by Procladius, Tanytarsus gracilentus-type and Polypedilum nubeculosum-type throughout the core. The record reveals that these chironomid taxa responded to two periods of catchment erosion between c.1700-1100 cal yr BP and c.1920 A.D. to the present. We provide evidence which suggests that the recent erosion episode is caused by human activities; however, the earlier event (c.1700-1100 cal yr BP) is likely related to increased regional precipitation, possibly linked to the strengthening of the Indian summer monsoon in the late Holocene. It is notable that the chironomids, through their varied ecologies, are able to detect the human-induced changes as well as natural climate changes, for instance, enhanced precipitation. Coupling palaeoecological studies using chironomids with more traditional catchment erosion indicators is thus a powerful tool for reconstructing past environmental and climate change."

abstract,"Abstract The mechanisms structuring aquatic communities across environmental gradients are often difficult to distinguish from one another and can produce similar patterns of species distributions. In freshwater systems, the amount of canopy cover from surrounding trees is often associated with transitions in local community structure. These community changes could be driven by habitat selection prior to colonization of the aquatic habitat and/or species-sorting post-colonization. To assess the contributions of pre- versus post-colonization processes in structuring larval dragonfly assemblages, we tested the impact of artificial and natural canopy cover on the selection of experimental aquatic mesocosms by adult dragonflies, and monitored the performance (i.e. growth and survival) of larval dragonflies that were placed in mesocosms under a gradient of natural canopy cover. We found that greater levels of canopy cover resulted in fewer adult visits to mesocosms, and more natural canopy cover decreased the species richness of visitors. There were no effects of canopy cover on the growth and survival of larvae added to the mesocosms. Our results suggest that adult habitat selection plays a dominant role in structuring larval dragonfly assemblages across a canopy cover gradient, and that canopy cover can be an important environmental filter on species distributions."

abstract,"Abstract The occurrence of benthic diatoms in large river plankton is considered to be highly stochastic. Accordingly, the widely applied phytoplankton functional group concept sensu Reynolds (FG) classifies all benthic diatom taxa together. Based on data of a high-frequency 1-year long phytoplankton survey of the Pearl River (China), we tested whether the combination of the FG system with various trait-based classifications of benthic diatoms enhances our ability in predicting the community composition from the local environment. Using the Self-Organizing Map approach, we identified characteristic community compositions based on (i) taxonomic data, (ii) the FG approach, and (iii) the FG system combined with trait-based functional approaches of benthic diatoms: size structure, ecological guilds, and eco-morphological groups. All combined functional approaches enabled better predictions for the community composition than the taxonomic data or the FG system alone. The most reliable approach was the combination of the FG system with ecological guilds of benthic diatoms. Therefore, the occurrence of benthic diatoms in large river phytoplankton can be assessed ecologically in a meaningful way based on combined planktic and benthic functional classifications. The application of this approach seems to be highly relevant in large river phytoplankton ecology, ecological modelling, or in ecological status indication."

abstract,"Abstract Many amphibian population declines have been associated with the introduction of alien aquatic predators. Here, we explore the vulnerability of tadpoles of two sympatric Japanese species [Pelophylax nigromaculatus (PN) and Rhacophorus schlegelii (RS)] to the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. We first examined the behavioral responses of the tadpoles to the cues of caged, fed crayfish predator in a controlled laboratory experiment, and subsequently tested their survival when together in the presence of free-ranging predator in outdoor mesocosms that simulated natural ponds. Only PN reduced activity level to the cues of the predator, but this apparent behavioral defense recorded in the laboratory did not result into higher survival in outdoor mesocosms. In mesocosms, PN exhibited higher biomass increment but experienced higher mortality in predator environments. The mechanism mediating mortality remains unclear though. These results indicate that sympatric prey may differentially respond and be disproportionally vulnerable to novel predators. Our study illustrates the possible contribution of a life-history trait influencing risk of predation in newly invaded systems."

abstract,"Abstract Subsurface marine hydrothermal vents (HVs) may provide a particular advantage to better understand evolutionary conditions of the early earth and future climate predictions for marine life. Hydrothermal vents (HV) are unique extreme environments that share several similarities with projected global and climate change scenarios in marine systems (e.g., low pH due to high carbon dioxide and sulfite compounds, high temperature and turbidity, high loads of toxic chemicals such as H2S and trace metals). Particularly, shallow hydrothermal vents are easily accessible for short-term and long-term experiments. Research on organisms from shallow HVs may provide insights in the molecular, ecological, and evolutionary adaptations to extreme oceanic environments by comparing them with evolutionary related but less adapted biota. A shallow-water hydrothermal vent system at the northeast Taiwan coast has been intensively studied by several international research teams. These studies revealed astounding highlights at the levels of ecosystem (being fueled by photosynthesis and chemosynthesis), community (striking biodiversity changes due to mass mortality), population (retarded growth characteristics), individual (habitat attractive behavior), and molecular (adaptations to elevated concentrations of heavy metals, low pH, and elevated temperature). The present opinion paper evaluates the potential of shallow hydrothermal vents to be used as a templates for global change scenarios."

abstract,"Abstract Unauthorized introductions are an ongoing problem for fisheries managers. To understand reasons for the continued spread of nonnative fish species, the pathways of nonnative fish introductions were analyzed from 1961 to 2017 in Wyoming, USA. Unauthorized introductions are those that occurred without oversight of a management agency. The largest source of unauthorized introductions was the deliberate, illegal release of fish by the public at 46% of the 215 introduction events. The next largest source was colonization of new water bodies after initial establishment at 29%. Inadvertent (accidental) stockings (8%) and unknown sources (17%) were the other pathways documented. Management responses consisted of attempts at complete eradication (9%), population reduction (10%), or containment (3%) although in the majority of introductions (79%) no action was taken. The introductions involved 49 taxa but three sport fish constituted 26.5% of all events: brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, walleye Sander vitreus, and yellow perch Perca flavescens. The prevalence of illegal introductions and the difficulty of eradicating introduced species indicate the continuing need for public education and enforcement efforts. The high frequency whereby species colonize new waterbodies indicates that fish introductions, even those authorized by management agencies, must consider the high probability that species will expand into unintended waterways."

abstract,"Abstract The invasive species Nile tilapia is a filter-feeding omnivorous fish that can have a negative effect on zooplankton and phytoplankton resources. However, the strength of its effects on plankton communities should decrease with increasing plankton biomass, e.g., during an algal bloom. We tested this hypothesis by performing two experiments in a tropical reservoir, where we randomly allocated two treatments (with and without tilapia) to 20 mesocosms. The first experiment was conducted during an algal bloom (biovolume = 1038.34 mm3 l−1), while the second experiment was conducted after the bloom (biovolume = 1.05 mm3 l−1). The negative effects of fish on mesozooplankton (mean size of 480 µm in both experiments) and large algae (GALD ≥ 50 µm) were stronger in the second than in the first experiment. On the other hand, the negative effects of fish on microzooplankton (experiment 1: mean size 180 µm; experiment 2: mean size 128 µm) and small algae (GALD < 50 µm) were stronger in the first than in the second experiment. We conclude that the Nile tilapia can suppress phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass in tropical lakes and reservoirs, but the magnitude of this effect depends on plankton biomass and size-structure."

abstract,"Abstract Many studies have examined trophic cascades in allochthonous lotic systems of temperate streams, but few have examined those in subtropical and tropical streams. Many subtropical and tropical streams are characterised as detritivore-poor stream systems, which might result in a fundamental difference in the trophic cascades of brown food webs. We performed an in situ experiment to test the effects of the presence or absence of a small-bodied endemic benthic fish and of the mass of litter packs (five levels), arranged in a full factorial design (10 treatments), on macroinvertebrate detritivore assemblages and invertebrate-mediated breakdown rates and to identify possible trophic cascades. Fish slightly reduced the invertebrate-mediated breakdown rates by depressing detritivore abundance. Effects of fish predators and litter pack size on detritivore abundance were species dependent. Nemouridae (Plecoptera), a non-camouflage detritivore (without a casing), was highly sensitive to the presence of fish predators. By contrast, camouflaged detritivores, such as Stenochironomus spp. (Diptera), which mine decayed leaves, and Anisocentropus sp. (Trichoptera), a case-building caddisfly, were able to avoid being preyed upon and thereby buffered the effect of predation on litter processing. These results suggest that ecosystem functioning of detritus-based stream systems could be regulated by the traits of dominant detritivores."

abstract,"Abstract While it is accepted that invasive species are non-native organisms that become abundant and cause ecological damage in areas where they are introduced, the problem of ‘native invaders,’ native species that become excessively abundant due to anthropogenic impacts, is frequently encountered by ecologists. Often, native and non-native invaders occur in sympatry. Understanding relative severity of their impacts and niches they occupy is needed to inform management actions. Here, we quantify relative impact of native (black bullhead) and non-native (common carp) benthic fish on macrophytes species richness in over 200 lakes in North America. The impact of each species was addressed while accounting for the effects of water clarity, depth, lake area, watershed size, shoreline irregularity, land use by humans, abundance of planktivorous fishes, and ecoregion. Using model selection, we show that both species had negative impact on macrophytes richness, but the impact of carp was approximately two times as strong when adjusted for catch rates. We also conducted a principal component analysis followed by permutation procedures, which showed that carp and bullheads often occurred together in shallow, turbid lakes in watershed dominated by human use. Our findings have implications for lake-restoration efforts via carp or bullhead management."

abstract,"Abstract The study of glacial relict species has been focused on understanding how the biogeographic patterns of species have developed. A number of studies using phylogenetic and population genetics approaches have been conducted for terrestrial glacial relict species, and the mechanisms of their formation have been elucidated. On the other hand, less focus has been placed on glacial relict species inhabiting freshwater systems. In particular, stable lakes can serve as refugia during a glacial period, but research studies on freshwater relict species inhabiting lakes have not been well conducted. In order to clarify the mechanism of the glacial relict species in freshwater, we conducted a molecular phylogeny analysis, divergence time estimation, and a biogeographic reconstruction on freshwater Valvatidae molluscs, which have been considered as a glacial relict in the Japanese Archipelago. Our study shows that the valvatid fauna in the Japanese Archipelago was produced by multiple dispersal events from the Asian continent and by vicariance events during the period of the Pliocene–Quaternary glaciation. It includes multiple relict species that survived interglacial periods in different lakes. These findings suggest that the lakes can serve as refugia not only during glacial periods, but also during interglacial periods."

abstract,"Abstract In the Mediterranean Sea, Aristaeomorpha foliacea and Aristeus antennatus are the most important target species of deep-sea trawl fisheries. Previous studies performed in several areas of the Mediterranean highlighted the key role played by both environmental factors, such as temperature, and anthropogenic activities, such as fishing, in affecting the abundance and distribution of the two species. The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on the abundance and spatial distribution of A. foliacea and A. antennatus in the Ligurian and northern and central Tyrrhenian Seas (NW Mediterranean). To this end, the time series of MEDITS trawl survey data (1994–2015) were analyzed together with environmental variables, namely sea surface temperature, current speed, and fishing effort by means of GAM. The results show that fishing plays an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of the two species. A. antennatus is prevalent where fishing effort is higher; this can be related to the higher resilience of blue and red shrimp to fishery impact. In contrast, high temperatures are associated to the prevalence of A. foliacea. Therefore, the abundance and spatial distribution of this species is mainly driven by temperature."

abstract,"Abstract Phytoplankton (PCC) and prokaryoplankton community compositions were studied in five perialpine lakes (Garda, Maggiore, Como, Iseo, and Lugano) of different trophic conditions and mixing regimes, using inverted microscopy and CARD-FISH technique. The aim of this research was to assess, for the first time in these lakes, the relationships among PCC, bacteria, and archaea, and the effects of environmental drivers. We observed a clear difference of PCC compositions in spring and summer. All the lakes showed Bacillariophyta dominating in spring, whereas in summer, there were remarkable differences of PCC. Prokaryoplankton composition showed more pronounced differences in the vertical profile than those between spring and summer. The oligomictic lakes showed a uniform vertical gradient of prokaryotes in spring, while in the meromictic lakes, their abundances were incremented with depth. In summer, the prokaryotic community changed, and niche differentiation occurred in almost all lakes. In conclusion, our study showed a general pattern, common to all the lakes, of a first appearance of the large-sized “opportunistic” bacteria in spring, followed by ultramicrobacteria, less vulnerable to predation in summer. Significant correlations between a few PCC and bacterial groups were found, thus elucidating that functional interactions can be the key to understand plankton successions."

abstract,"Abstract The present study analyzed trace element concentrations from the shells of native freshwater mussels collected from the headwater tributaries of the Illinois River (USA). These analyses were conducted to determine whether (A) anthropogenic enrichment could be observed and (B) whether enrichment had decreased following the enactment of Clean Water Act legislation in the 1970s. Collections archived in museums allowed comparison of the pre-Columbian period, the mid-20th century, and the early 21st century. The element Cu was consistently elevated above pre-Columbian baselines, while the elements As, Cd, Fe, and Zn were elevated in some collections. Although higher than baseline, concentrations Zn consistently declined from the mid-20th century to modern times, although differences occurred at individual sites. There was evidence for food web influence: the element Mn was significantly negatively correlated to sediment primary productivity as indexed by shell δ13C and Cu was positively correlated to trophic position as reflected by shell δ15N. Zn correlated to stream order across all time periods. We conclude that a mixture of historic factors affecting pollution control and land use patterns in the watershed led to sometimes conflicting effects on trace element bioaccumulation in mussel shells."

abstract,"Abstract Herbivory can determine the rates of ecosystem functions and is key factor to periphytic algae development. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of herbivory of zooplankton and omnivorous fish in periphytic algae of lake ecosystems. Based on prediction of grazer:prey size ratio, we tested that periphytic algal biomass and density will be lower in the fish treatments. Based on prediction of the size-selective predation, size-efficiency hypothesis, and general allometric equations, and that both herbivores will feed with distinct mode, we tested the hypothesis that periphytic algal functional diversity will be higher in the mixed treatment. There were four treatments (Control, T1-zooplankton, T2-fish, T3-zooplankton+fish). We evaluated algae biomass, density, functional traits, functional diversity, and the herbivory effect. Our results show that the presence of both herbivores were related to higher functional diversity, lower density values, and prostrate periphytic algae, and in T2 occurs higher periphytic algae biomass via nutrient facilitation. Fish was responsible for the higher consumer effect size, and was more important modifier than zooplankton of the periphytic algae community. The greater variation in producer species traits was directly related to mixed foraging patterns of herbivores together, which allow rare species to persist, decreasing the dominance of stronger competitive species."

abstract,"Abstract Invasive species are well documented to impact native species where they are introduced. In the Santa Monica Mountains, a native species of amphibian, the California newt (Taricha torosa) possesses a neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin (TTX) that is considered a chemical defense against predation but also appears to facilitate ecological processes and specifically affect freshwater macroinvertebrate behavior. A recently introduced invasive species, the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), is known to negatively affect ecosystems it invades and means to control its proliferation once introduced are limited. Given the ecological role of newt neurotoxin, we hypothesized that TTX may impact P. antipodarum behavior and tested its effects upon snail movement in laboratory assays and in-stream experiments. When snails were exposed to ecologically realistic TTX concentrations and newt chemical cues that contain TTX they moved significantly less and distance was significantly reduced relative to controls. In a natural stream, significantly more P. antipodarum moved out of areas exposed to newt chemical cues relative to snails in the presence of native tree frog cues (Pseudacris cadaverina). Our results suggest that California newts may help limit the spread of P. antipodarum in streams where T. torosa is both able to persist and possess adequate chemical defenses."

abstract,"Abstract Climate change is affecting the global hydrological cycle and is causing drastic changes in the freshwater hydrological regime. Water level (WL) reduction caused by drought tends to increase the concentration of nutrients favoring the dominance of cyanobacteria. We hypothesized that the WL reduction favors the dominance of cyanobacteria at regular dry conditions, but at extremely dry events mixotrophic algae would thrive because of light limitation due to increased resuspension of sediments on the water column. To test our hypothesis, we compared phytoplankton traits and water quality variables between two sets of reservoirs located in two watersheds with contrasting precipitation regimes within the Brazilian semi-arid. The reservoirs were compared in a dry period and in an extremely dry period to evaluate the response of the variables to an extreme drought. Drought intensification decreased the reservoirs’ WL and water transparency and increased the total phosphorous. Cyanobacteria dominated in the dry period, and the contribution of mixotrophic algae increased in the extremely dry period. Thus, phytoplankton with mixotrophic potential was favored by the extreme drought. This result suggests that this can be one possible scenario for phytoplankton communities in reservoirs of semi-arid regions if extreme droughts become more frequent because of climate change."

In this article we present an existence theory for the physically more realistic case \({0 < \beta < \frac{1}{3}}\). A classical variational principle for fully localised solitary waves is reduced to a locally equivalent variational principle featuring a perturbation of the functional associated with the Davey–Stewartson equation. A nontrivial critical point of the reduced functional is found by minimising it over its natural constraint set."

The opening angles of cones and edges are allowed to be any number in \({(0,2\pi)\backslash\{\pi\}}\). We prove that such an obstacle scatters any incoming wave non-trivially (that is, the far field patterns cannot vanish identically), leading to the absence of real non-scattering wavenumbers. Local and global uniqueness results for the inverse problem of recovering the shape of penetrable scatterers are also obtained using a single incoming wave. Our approach relies on the singularity analysis of the inhomogeneous Laplace equation in a cone."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we study the stability of the three-dimensional jet created by a supersonic flow past a concave cornered wedge with the lower pressure at the downstream. The gas beyond the jet boundary is assumed to be static. It can be formulated as a nonlinear hyperbolic free boundary problem in a cornered domain with two characteristic free boundaries of different types: one is the rarefaction wave, while the other one is the contact discontinuity, which can be either a vortex sheet or an entropy wave. A more delicate argument is developed to establish the existence and stability of the square jet structure under the perturbation of the supersonic incoming flow and the pressure at the downstream. The methods and techniques developed here are also helpful for other problems involving similar difficulties."

abstract,"Abstract We prove the local-in-time existence of solutions with a contact discontinuity of the equations of ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for two dimensional planar flows provided that the Rayleigh–Taylor sign condition \({[\partial p/\partial N] <0 }\) on the jump of the normal derivative of the pressure is satisfied at each point of the initial discontinuity. MHD contact discontinuities are characteristic discontinuities with no flow across the discontinuity for which the pressure, the magnetic field and the velocity are continuous whereas the density and the entropy may have a jump. This paper is a natural completion of our previous analysis (Morando et al. in J Differ Equ 258:2531–2571, 2015) where the well-posedness in Sobolev spaces of the linearized problem was proved under the Rayleigh–Taylor sign condition satisfied at each point of the unperturbed discontinuity. The proof of the resolution of the nonlinear problem given in the present paper follows from a suitable tame a priori estimate in Sobolev spaces for the linearized equations and a Nash–Moser iteration."

abstract,"Abstract We are concerned with globally defined entropy solutions to the Euler equations for compressible fluid flows in transonic nozzles with general cross-sectional areas. Such nozzles include the de Laval nozzles and other more general nozzles whose cross-sectional area functions are allowed at the nozzle ends to be either zero (closed ends) or infinity (unbounded ends). To achieve this, in this paper, we develop a vanishing viscosity method to construct globally defined approximate solutions and then establish essential uniform estimates in weighted L p  norms for the whole range of physical adiabatic exponents \({\gamma\in (1, \infty)}\), so that the viscosity approximate solutions satisfy the general L p  compensated compactness framework. The viscosity method is designed to incorporate artificial viscosity terms with the natural Dirichlet boundary conditions to ensure the uniform estimates. Then such estimates lead to both the convergence of the approximate solutions and the existence theory of globally defined finite-energy entropy solutions to the Euler equations for transonic flows that may have different end-states in the class of nozzles with general cross-sectional areas for all \({\gamma\in (1, \infty)}\). The approach and techniques developed here apply to other problems with similar difficulties. In particular, we successfully apply them to construct globally defined spherically symmetric entropy solutions to the Euler equations for all \({\gamma\in (1, \infty)}\)."

The latter can be expressed with the help of correctors. We prove that the homogenized integrand admits a quadratic Taylor expansion in an open neighborhood of the rotations – a result that can be interpreted as the fact that homogenization and linearization commute close to the rotations. Moreover, for small applied loads, we provide an estimate on the homogenization error in terms of a quantitative two-scale expansion."

We study a pressureless Euler system with a non-linear density-dependent alignment term, originating in the Cucker–Smale swarming models. The alignment term is dissipative in the sense that it tends to equilibrate the velocities. Its density dependence is natural: the alignment rate increases in the areas of high density due to species discomfort. The diffusive term has the order of a fractional Laplacian \({(-\partial _{xx})^{\alpha/2}, \alpha \in (0, 1)}\). The corresponding Burgers equation with a linear dissipation of this type develops shocks in a finite time. We show that the alignment nonlinearity enhances the dissipation, and the solutions are globally regular for all \({\alpha \in (0, 1)}\). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of such regularization due to the non-local nonlinear modulation of dissipation."

To this end, motivated by the micro–macro decomposition to the Boltzmann equation in Liu and Yu (Commun Math Phys 246:133–179, 2004) and Liu et al. (Physica D 188:178–192, 2004), we first set up a new micro–macro decomposition around the local Maxwellian related to the bipolar VPB system and give a unified framework to study the nonlinear stability of the basic wave patterns to the system. Then, as applications of this new decomposition, the time-asymptotic stability of the two typical nonlinear wave patterns, viscous shock waves and rarefaction waves are proved for the 1D bipolar VPB system. More precisely, it is first proved that the linear superposition of two Boltzmann shock profiles in the first and third characteristic fields is nonlinearly stable to the 1D bipolar VPB system up to some suitable shifts without the zero macroscopic mass conditions on the initial perturbations. Then the time-asymptotic stability of the rarefaction wave fan to compressible Euler equations is proved for the 1D bipolar VPB system. These two results are concerned with the nonlinear stability of wave patterns for Boltzmann equation coupled with additional (electric) forces, which together with spectral analysis made in Li et al.

abstract,"Abstract Linear elasticity can be rigorously derived from finite elasticity under the assumption of small loadings in terms of Gamma-convergence. This was first done in the case of one-well energies with super-quadratic growth and later generalised to different settings, in particular to the case of multi-well energies where the distance between the wells is very small (comparable to the size of the load). In this paper we study the case when the distance between the wells is independent of the size of the load. In this context linear elasticity can be derived by adding to the multi-well energy a singular higher order term which penalises jumps from one well to another. The size of the singular term has to satisfy certain scaling assumptions whose optimality is shown in most of the cases. Finally, the derivation of linear elasticty from a two-well discrete model is provided, showing that the role of the singular perturbation term is played in this setting by interactions beyond nearest neighbours."

abstract,"Abstract A common feature of systems of conservation laws of continuum physics is that they are endowed with natural companion laws which are in such cases most often related to the second law of thermodynamics. This observation easily generalizes to any symmetrizable system of conservation laws; they are endowed with nontrivial companion conservation laws, which are immediately satisfied by classical solutions. Not surprisingly, weak solutions may fail to satisfy companion laws, which are then often relaxed from equality to inequality and overtake the role of physical admissibility conditions for weak solutions. We want to answer the question: what is a critical regularity of weak solutions to a general system of conservation laws to satisfy an associated companion law as an equality? An archetypal example of such a result was derived for the incompressible Euler system in the context of Onsager’s conjecture in the early nineties. This general result can serve as a simple criterion to numerous systems of mathematical physics to prescribe the regularity of solutions needed for an appropriate companion law to be satisfied."

By an application of Thom’s transversality theorem, we also prove that when the initial data is in an open dense subset of \({H^1(\mathbb{R})\cap W^{1,4}(\mathbb{R})}\), the solution is piecewise smooth.

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we investigate the compressible subsonic impinging jet flows through a semi-infinitely long nozzle and impacting on a solid wall. Firstly, it is shown that given a two-dimensional semi-infinitely long nozzle and a wall behind the nozzle, and an appropriate atmospheric pressure, then there exists a smooth global subsonic compressible impinging jet flow with two asymptotic directions. The subsonic impinging jet develops two free streamlines, which initiate smoothly at the end points of the semi-infinitely long nozzles. In particular, there exists a smooth curve which separates the fluids which go to different places downstream. Moreover, under some suitable asymptotic assumptions of the nozzle, the asymptotic behaviors of the compressible subsonic impinging jet flows in the inlet and the downstream are obtained by means of a blow-up argument. On the other hand, the non-existence of compressible subsonic impinging jet flows with only one asymptotic direction is also established. This main result in this paper solves the open problem (4) in Chapter 16.3 proposed by Friedman in his famous survey (Friedman in Mathematics in industrial problems, II, I.M.A. volumes in mathematics and its applications, vol 24, Springer, New York, 1989)."

Then we prove that there is a curve of (−1)-homogeneous axisymmetric solutions with nonzero swirl, having the same smoothness property, emanating from every point of the interior and one part of the boundary of the solution surface. Moreover we prove that there is no such curve of solutions for any point on the other part of the boundary. We also establish asymptotic expansions for every (−1)-homogeneous axisymmetric solutions in a neighborhood of the singular point on the unit sphere."

Even when there are no natural action variables, our approach still leads to useful normal forms for dynamical systems, which are not necessarily integrable."

abstract,"Abstract Consider the scattering of a time-domain acoustic plane wave by a bounded elastic obstacle which is immersed in a homogeneous air or fluid. This paper concerns the mathematical analysis of such a time-domain acoustic–elastic interaction problem. An exact transparent boundary condition (TBC) is developed to reduce the scattering problem from an open domain into an initial-boundary value problem in a bounded domain. The well-posedness and stability are established for the reduced problem. A priori estimates with explicit time dependence are achieved for the pressure of the acoustic wave field and the displacement of the elastic wave field. Our proof is based on the method of energy, the Lax–Milgram lemma, and the inversion theorem of the Laplace transform. In addition, a time-domain absorbing perfectly matched layer (PML) method is introduced to replace the nonlocal TBC by a Dirichlet boundary condition. A first order symmetric hyperbolic system is derived for the truncated PML problem. The well-posedness and stability are proved. The time-domain PML results are expected to be useful in the computational air/fluid–solid interaction problems."

In the interior it is known, by the celebrated work of Rivière, that these maps satisfy a system with an antisymmetric potential, from which one can derive the interior regularity of the solution. Avoiding a reflection argument, we show that these maps satisfy along the boundary a system of equations which also exhibits a (nonlocal) antisymmetric potential that combines information from the interior potential and the geometric Neumann boundary condition. We then proceed to show boundary regularity for solutions to such systems."

To this end we construct a suitable approximation of the solution of the Stokes/Allen–Cahn system, using three levels of the terms in the formally matched asymptotic calculations, and estimate the difference with the aid of a suitable refinement of a spectral estimate of the linearized Allen–Cahn operator. Moreover, a careful treatment of the coupling terms is needed."

This is a free boundary problem: the interface between the fluid in the vessel and the air above (modeled by a trivial fluid) is free to move and experiences capillary forces. The three-phase interface where the fluid, air, and solid vessel wall meet is known as a contact point, and the angle formed between the free interface and the vessel is called the contact angle. We consider a model of this problem that allows for fully dynamic contact points and angles. We develop a scheme of a priori estimates for the model, which then allow us to show that for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the model admits global solutions that decay to equilibrium exponentially quickly."

A typical example is the curve-shortening flow in \({\mathbb{R}^d}\), which is a particular case of mean-curvature flow with a co-dimension higher than one (except in the case d = 2). Through such a change of time, this flow can be formally derived from the conservative model of vibrating strings obtained from the Nambu–Goto action. Using the concept of “relative entropy” (or “modulated energy”), borrowed from the theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, we introduce a notion of generalized solutions, that we call dissipative solutions, for the curve-shortening flow. For given initial conditions, the set of generalized solutions is convex and compact, if not empty. Smooth solutions to the curve-shortening flow are always unique in this setting."

We prove a general convergence result and a typical characterization by Stability and Energy Balance in a setting comparable to the standard energetic one, thus capable of covering a wide range of applications. The new refined Energy Balance condition compensates for the localized stability and provides a careful description of the jump behavior: at every jump the solution follows an optimal transition, which resembles in a suitable variational sense the discrete scheme that has been implemented for the whole construction."

The equations can be derived from an on-lattice random-walk model with general transition rates. In the case of linear transition rates, it extends the two-species population model of Shigesada, Kawasaki, and Teramoto. The equations are considered in a bounded domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The existence proof is based on a refined entropy method and a new approximation scheme. Global existence follows under a detailed balance or weak cross-diffusion condition. The detailed balance condition is related to the symmetry of the mobility matrix, which mirrors Onsager’s principle in thermodynamics. Under detailed balance (and without reaction) the entropy is nonincreasing in time, but counter-examples show that the entropy may increase initially if detailed balance does not hold."

Our analysis is based on the new algorithm of explicitly constructing the Green’s function for the system linearized around the shock profile. We first construct Green’s function for the system linearized around the inviscid profile by matching the two half space problems. The Green’s function around the shock profile is then constructed by iterations. Our approach is of a general nature. We carry out the approach for a simple model possessing the Burgers shocks and wave structure similar to acoustic cones in multi-dimensional gas flows. The approach exhibits a rich phenomenon of wave propagation along and dispersing away from the shock profile.

abstract,"Abstract In this paper we rigorously investigate the emergence of defects on Nematic Shells with a genus different from one. This phenomenon is related to a non-trivial interplay between the topology of the shell and the alignment of the director field. To this end, we consider a discrete XY system on the shell M, described by a tangent vector field with unit norm sitting at the vertices of a triangulation of the shell. Defects emerge when we let the mesh size of the triangulation go to zero, namely in the discrete-to-continuum limit. In this paper we investigate the discrete-to-continuum limit in terms of Γ-convergence in two different asymptotic regimes. The first scaling promotes the appearance of a finite number of defects whose charges are in accordance with the topology of shell M, via the Poincaré–Hopf Theorem. The second scaling produces the so called Renormalized Energy that governs the equilibrium of the configurations with defects."

We find that the classical solutions are recovered in the case of linear elasticity. We identify conditions for convergence of Data-Driven solutions corresponding to sequences of approximating material data sets. Specialization to constant material data set sequences in turn establishes an appropriate notion of relaxation. We find that relaxation within this Data-Driven framework is fundamentally different from the classical relaxation of energy functions. For instance, we show that in the Data-Driven framework the relaxation of a bistable material leads to material data sets that are not graphs."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, for the spatial Newtonian 2n-body problem with equal masses, by proving that the minimizers of the action functional under certain symmetric, topological and monotone constraints are collision-free, we found a family of spatial double choreographies, which have the common feature that half of the masses are circling around the z-axis clockwise along a spatial loop, while the motions of the other half of the masses are given by a rotation of the first half around the x-axis by π. Both loops are simple, without any self-intersection, and symmetric with respect to the xz-plane and yz-plane. The set of intersection points between the two loops is non-empty and contained in the xy-plane. The number of such double choreographies grows exponentially as n goes to infinity."

These new defects are physically important since it has recently been shown (Wang et al. in Nat Mater 15:106–112, 2016) that topological defects are a “template for molecular self-assembly” in liquid crystals. Connections with the modified KdV equation are also discussed."

abstract,"Abstract We study a phase-field variational model for the solvation of charged molecules with an implicit solvent. The solvation free-energy functional of all phase fields consists of the surface energy, solute excluded volume and solute-solvent van der Waals dispersion energy, and electrostatic free energy. The surface energy is defined by the van der Waals–Cahn–Hilliard functional with squared gradient and a double-well potential. The electrostatic part of free energy is defined through the electrostatic potential governed by the Poisson–Boltzmann equation in which the dielectric coefficient is defined through the underlying phase field. We prove the continuity of the electrostatics—its potential, free energy, and dielectric boundary force—with respect to the perturbation of the dielectric boundary. We also prove the \({\Gamma}\)-convergence of the phase-field free-energy functionals to their sharp-interface limit, and the equivalence of the convergence of total free energies to that of all individual parts of free energy. We finally prove the convergence of phase-field forces to their sharp-interface limit. Such forces are defined as the negative first variations of the free-energy functional; and arise from stress tensors. In particular, we obtain the force convergence for the van der Waals–Cahn–Hilliard functionals with minimal assumptions."

abstract,"Abstract The Cucker–Smale flocking model belongs to a wide class of kinetic models that describe a collective motion of interacting particles that exhibit some specific tendency, e.g. to aggregate, flock or disperse. This paper examines the kinetic Cucker–Smale equation with a singular communication weight. Given a compactly supported measure as an initial datum we construct a global in time weak measure-valued solution in the space \({C_{weak}(0,\infty;\mathcal{M})}\). The solution is defined as a mean-field limit of the empirical distributions of particles, the dynamics of which is governed by the Cucker–Smale particle system. The studied communication weight is \({\psi(s)=|s|^{-\alpha}}\) with \({\alpha \in \left(0,\frac 12\right)}\). This range of singularity admits the sticking of characteristics/trajectories. The second result concerns the weak-atomic uniqueness property stating that a weak solution initiated by a finite sum of atoms, i.e. Dirac deltas in the form \({m_i \delta_{x_i} \otimes \delta_{v_i}}\), preserves its atomic structure. Hence these coincide with unique solutions to the system of ODEs associated with the Cucker–Smale particle system."

We reveal its underlying structure as a generalized gradient system, where the driving energy functional is highly nonconvex and features the geometric nonlinearities related to finite-strain elasticity as well as the multiplicative decomposition of finite-strain plasticity. Moreover, the dissipation potential depends on the left-invariant plastic rate, and thus depends on the plastic state variable. The existence theory is developed for a class of abstract, nonsmooth, and nonconvex gradient systems, for which we introduce suitable notions of solutions, namely energy-dissipation-balance and energy-dissipation-inequality solutions. Hence, we resort to the toolbox of the direct method of the calculus of variations to check that the specific energy and dissipation functionals for our viscoplastic models comply with the conditions of the general theory."

abstract,"Abstract We consider a congested aggregation model that describes the evolution of a density through the competing effects of nonlocal Newtonian attraction and a hard height constraint. This provides a counterpoint to existing literature on repulsive–attractive nonlocal interaction models, where the repulsive effects instead arise from an interaction kernel or the addition of diffusion. We formulate our model as the Wasserstein gradient flow of an interaction energy, with a penalization to enforce the constraint on the height of the density. From this perspective, the problem can be seen as a singular limit of the Keller–Segel equation with degenerate diffusion. Two key properties distinguish our problem from previous work on height constrained equations: nonconvexity of the interaction kernel (which places the model outside the scope of classical gradient flow theory) and nonlocal dependence of the velocity field on the density (which causes the problem to lack a comparison principle). To overcome these obstacles, we combine recent results on gradient flows of nonconvex energies with viscosity solution theory. We characterize the dynamics of patch solutions in terms of a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem and, using this characterization, show that in two dimensions patch solutions converge to a characteristic function of a disk in the long-time limit, with an explicit rate on the decay of the energy. We believe that a key contribution of the present work is our blended approach, combining energy methods with viscosity solution theory."

abstract,"Abstract We consider the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent weakly random potential of a strength \({\epsilon\ll 1}\), with Gaussian statistics. We prove that when the initial condition varies on a scale much larger than the correlation length of the potential, the compensated wave function converges to a deterministic limit on the time scale \({t\sim\epsilon^{-2}}\). This is shown under the assumption that the correlation function R(x) of the random potential belongs to the Schoenberg class and decays faster than \({1/|x|^2}\), which ensures that the effective potential is finite. When R(x) decays slower than \({1/|x|^2}\), the effective potential is infinite, and we establish an anomalous effective behavior for the averaged wave function on a time scale shorter than \({\epsilon^{-2}}\), as long as the initial condition is “sufficiently macroscopic”. We also consider the kinetic regime when the initial condition varies on the same scale as the random potential and obtain the limit of the averaged wave function for potentials with the correlation functions decaying faster than \({1/|x|^2}\). The fact that the correlation belongs to the Schoenberg class allows us to bypass the oscillatory phase estimates."

It also provides a weak–strong uniqueness theorem for measure valued solutions of the hyperbolic problem. In the second part, the relative entropy identity is developed for the systems of gas dynamics for viscous and heat conducting gases and for the system of thermoviscoelasticity both including viscosity and heat-conduction effects. The dissipation mechanisms and the concentration measures play different roles when applying the method to the general class of hyperbolic–parabolic systems and to the specific examples, and their ramifications are highlighted."

abstract,"Abstract This paper treats radially symmetric motions of nonlinearly viscoelastic circular-cylindrical and spherical shells subjected to the live loads of centrifugal force and (time-dependent) hydrostatic pressures. The governing equations are exact versions of those for 3-dimensional continuum mechanics (so shell does not connote an approximate via some shell theory). These motions are governed by quasilinear third-order parabolic-hyperbolic equations having but one independent spatial variable. The principal part of such a partial differential equation is determined by a general family of nonlinear constitutive equations. The presence of strains in two orthogonal directions requires a careful treatment of constitutive restrictions that are physically natural and support the analysis. The interaction of geometrically exact formulations, the compatible use of general constitutive equations for material response, and the presence of live loads show how these factors play crucial roles in the behavior of solutions. In particular, for different kinds of live loads there are thresholds separating materials that produce qualitatively different dynamical behavior. The analysis (using classical methods) covers infinite-time blowup for cylindrical shells subject to centrifugal forces, infinite-time blowup for cylindrical shells subject to steady and time-dependent hydrostatic pressures, finite-time blowup for spherical shells subject to steady and time-dependent hydrostatic pressures, and the preclusion of total compression. This paper concludes with a sketch (using some modern methods) of the existence of regular solutions until the time of blowup."

For this purpose, H 1 is given the structure of a Finsler manifold, where the norm of tangent vectors is defined in terms of an optimal transportation problem. For paths of piecewise smooth solutions, one can carefully estimate how the weighted length grows in time. By the generic regularity result proved in [7], these piecewise regular paths are dense and can be used to construct a geodesic distance with the desired Lipschitz property."

abstract,"Abstract This work is devoted to the asymptotic analysis of high frequency wave propagation in random media with long-range dependence. We are interested in two asymptotic regimes, that we investigate simultaneously: the paraxial approximation, where the wave is collimated and propagates along a privileged direction of propagation, and the white-noise limit, where random fluctuations in the background are well approximated in a statistical sense by a fractional white noise. The fractional nature of the fluctuations is reminiscent of the long-range correlations in the underlying random medium. A typical physical setting is laser beam propagation in turbulent atmosphere. Starting from the high frequency wave equation with fast non-Gaussian random oscillations in the velocity field, we derive the fractional Itô–Schrödinger equation, that is, a Schrödinger equation with potential equal to a fractional white noise. The proof involves a fine analysis of the backscattering and of the coupling between the propagating and evanescent modes. Because of the long-range dependence, classical diffusion-approximation theorems for equations with random coefficients do not apply, and we therefore use moment techniques to study the convergence."

We obtain the pointwise estimates of the time-asymptotic shape of the solution, which exhibit a generalized Huygens’ principle as the Navier–Stokes system. This phenomenon is the most important difference from the unipolar Navier–Stokes–Poisson system. Due to the non-conservative structure of the system (1.1) and the interplay of two carriers which counteract the influence of the electric field (a nonlocal term), some new observations are essential for the proof. We fully use the conservative structure of the system for the total density and total momentum, and the mechanism of the linearized unipolar Navier–Stokes–Poisson system together with the special form of the nonlinear terms in the system for the difference of densities and the difference of momentums. Lastly, as a byproduct, we extend the usual \({L^2({\mathbb{R}}^3)}\)-decay rate to the \({L^p({\mathbb{R}}^3)}\)-decay rate with \({p > 1}\) and also improve former decay rates."

abstract,"Abstract We study the bifurcation diagram of the Onsager free-energy functional for liquid crystals with orientation parameter on the sphere. In particular, we concentrate on the bifurcations from the isotropic solution for a general class of two-body interaction potentials including the Onsager kernel. Reformulating the problem as a non-linear eigenvalue problem for the kernel operator, we prove that spherical harmonics are the corresponding eigenfunctions and we present a direct relationship between the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of this class of interaction potentials and their eigenvalues. We find explicit expressions for all bifurcation points corresponding to bifurcations from the isotropic state of the Onsager free-energy functional equipped with the Onsager interaction potential. A substantial amount of our analysis is based on the use of spherical harmonics and a special algorithm for computing expansions of products of spherical harmonics in terms of spherical harmonics is presented. Using a Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, we derive a bifurcation equation depending on five state variables. The dimension of this state space is further reduced to two dimensions by using the rotational symmetry of the problem and the invariant theory of groups. On the basis of these results, we show that the first bifurcation from the isotropic state of the Onsager interaction potential is a transcritical bifurcation and that the corresponding solution is uniaxial. In addition, we prove some global properties of the bifurcation diagram such as the fact that the trivial solution is the unique local minimiser if the bifurcation parameter is high, that it is not a local minimiser if the bifurcation parameter is small, the boundedness of all equilibria of the functional and that the bifurcation branches are either unbounded or that they meet another bifurcation branch."

abstract,"Abstract In the paper we deal with shells with non-zero Gaussian curvature. We derive sharp Korn’s first (linear geometric rigidity estimate) and second inequalities on that kind of shell for zero or periodic Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin type boundary conditions. We prove that if the Gaussian curvature is positive, then the optimal constant in the first Korn inequality scales like h, and if the Gaussian curvature is negative, then the Korn constant scales like h 4/3, where h is the thickness of the shell. These results have a classical flavour in continuum mechanics, in particular shell theory. The Korn first inequalities are the linear version of the famous geometric rigidity estimate by Friesecke et al. for plates in Arch Ration Mech Anal 180(2):183–236, 2006 (where they show that the Korn constant in the nonlinear Korn’s first inequality scales like h 2), extended to shells with nonzero curvature.

abstract,"Abstract This paper studies the existence of solitons, namely stable solitary waves, in an idealized suspension bridge. The bridge is modeled as an unbounded degenerate plate, that is, a central beam with cross sections, and displays two degrees of freedom: the vertical displacement of the beam and the torsional angles of the cross sections. Under fairly general assumptions, we prove the existence of solitons. Under the additional assumption of large tension in the sustaining cables, we prove that these solitons have a nontrivial torsional component. This appears relevant for security since several suspension bridges collapsed due to torsional oscillations."

abstract,"Abstract We seek to define statistical solutions of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws as time-parametrized probability measures on p-integrable functions. To do so, we prove the equivalence between probability measures on L  p  spaces and infinite families of correlation measures. Each member of this family, termed a correlation marginal, is a Young measure on a finite-dimensional tensor product domain and provides information about multi-point correlations of the underlying integrable functions. We also prove that any probability measure on a L  p  space is uniquely determined by certain moments (correlation functions) of the equivalent correlation measure. We utilize this equivalence to define statistical solutions of multi-dimensional conservation laws in terms of an infinite set of equations, each evolving a moment of the correlation marginal. These evolution equations can be interpreted as augmenting entropy measure-valued solutions, with additional information about the evolution of all possible multi-point correlation functions. Our concept of statistical solutions can accommodate uncertain initial data as well as possibly non-atomic solutions, even for atomic initial data. For multi-dimensional scalar conservation laws we impose additional entropy conditions and prove that the resulting entropy statistical solutions exist, are unique and are stable with respect to the 1-Wasserstein metric on probability measures on L 1."

abstract,"Abstract In this article we construct a global solution of the simplified Ericksen-Leslie system. We show that the velocity of the solution can be decomposed into the sum of three parts. The main flow is governed by the Oseen vortex with the same circulation Reynolds number as the initial fluid. The secondary flow has finite kinetic energy and decay in the speed (1 + t)−2 as \({t \rightarrow
\infty}\). The third part is a minor flow whose kinetic energy decays faster than the secondary flow. As for the orientation variable, our solution has a phase function which diverges logarithmically to \({\infty}\) as \({t \rightarrow \infty}\). This indicates that the orientation variable will keep rotating around the z-axis while \({t
\rightarrow \infty}\). This phenomenon results from a non-trivial coupling between the orientation variable and a fluid with a non-zero circulation Reynolds number."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper we develop a geometric version of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in the Poisson setting. Specifically, we “geometrize” what is usually called a complete solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. We use some well-known results about symplectic groupoids, in particular cotangent groupoids, as a keystone for the construction of our framework. Our methodology follows the ambitious program proposed by Weinstein (In Mechanics day (Waterloo, ON, 1992), volume 7 of fields institute communications, American Mathematical Society, Providence, 1996) in order to develop geometric formulations of the dynamical behavior of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids. This procedure allows us to take symmetries into account, and, as a by-product, we recover results from Channell and Scovel (Phys D 50(1):80–88, 1991), Ge (Indiana Univ. Math. J. 39(3):859–876, 1990), Ge and Marsden (Phys Lett A 133(3):134–139, 1988), but even in these situations our approach is new. A theory of generating functions for the Poisson structures considered here is also developed following the same pattern, solving a longstanding problem of the area: how to obtain a generating function for the identity transformation and the nearby Poisson automorphisms of Poisson manifolds. A direct application of our results gives the construction of a family of Poisson integrators, that is, integrators that conserve the underlying Poisson geometry. These integrators are implemented in the paper in benchmark problems. Some conclusions, current and future directions of research are shown at the end of the paper."

abstract,"Abstract For the gas–vacuum interface problem with physical singularity and the sound speed being \({C^{{1}/{2}}}\)-H\({\ddot{\rm o}}\)lder continuous near vacuum boundaries of the isentropic compressible Euler equations with damping, the global existence of smooth solutions and the convergence to Barenblatt self-similar solutions of the corresponding porous media equation are proved in this paper for spherically symmetric motions in three dimensions; this is done by overcoming the analytical difficulties caused by the coordinate’s singularity near the center of symmetry, and the physical vacuum singularity to which standard methods of symmetric hyperbolic systems do not apply. Various weights are identified to resolve the singularity near the vacuum boundary and the center of symmetry globally in time. The results obtained here contribute to the theory of global solutions to vacuum boundary problems of compressible inviscid fluids, for which the currently available results are mainly for the local-in-time well-posedness theory, and also to the theory of global smooth solutions of dissipative hyperbolic systems which fail to be strictly hyperbolic."

abstract,"Abstract This paper concerns the existence of critical points for solutions to second order elliptic equations of the form \({\nabla\cdot
\sigma(x)\nabla u=0}\) posed on a bounded domain X with prescribed boundary conditions. In spatial dimension n = 2, it is known that the number of critical points (where \({\nabla u=0}\)) is related to the number of oscillations of the boundary condition independently of the (positive) coefficient \({\sigma}\). We show that the situation is different in dimension \({n\geq3}\). More precisely, we obtain that for any fixed (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary condition for u on \({\partial X}\), there exists an open set of smooth coefficients \({\sigma(x)}\) such that \({\nabla u}\) vanishes at least at one point in X. By using estimates related to the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions, the result is first obtained for a piecewise constant conductivity with infinite contrast, a problem of independent interest. A second step shows that the topology of the vector field \({\nabla u}\) on a subdomain is not modified for appropriate bounded, sufficiently high-contrast, smooth coefficients \({\sigma(x)}\). These results find applications in the class of hybrid inverse problems, where optimal stability estimates for parameter reconstruction are obtained in the absence of critical points. Our results show that for any (finite number of) prescribed boundary conditions, there are coefficients \({\sigma(x)}\) for which the stability of the reconstructions will inevitably degrade."

For generalization of the model, Neuro-fuzzy membership functions have been used and simulated using mathematical tool MATLAB. Also, the proposed model has been validated with traditional COCOMO model (COCOMO 81) by using NASA software project data.

This paper, presents a switch hierarchical provider network which allows each data virtual nodes providing a separate logical DN routine to reduce the propagation delay through virtual-hierarchical topology utilising complex multi-path topology reducing switching complexity, and proposed traffic congestion-less schemes to reduce the fault-tolerance and load sharing.

abstract,"Abstract IP Multimedia Subsystem “IMS” is the modular architecture that provides users with reliable access to multimedia services (voice, video conferencing, interactive services, etc.). However, quality of service and security are one of the main concerns of operators when it comes to multimedia services. The Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol ensures these two basic needs. IMS is primarily based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for (i) routing, (ii) establishing, (iii) modifying, and (iv) closing a multimedia session. The SIP protocol represents the most influential protocol in the IMS architecture. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the SIP protocols in an IMS architecture with the MPLS protocol as the transport layer protocol. The evaluation will focus on: (I) the impact of the number of connections on the duration of SIP session establishment and (Ii) the impact of the number of users on the performances of IMS services (VOIP and Videoconferencing)."

abstract,Abstract A new block based blind color image watermarking method is presented in this work. The proposed method has been implemented using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The host color image is initially subjected to DWT and the coefficients belonging to a particular frequency band so obtained are divided into different blocks for watermark embedding. The watermark comprising of a grayscale image is bit sliced and the resultant bits are inserted in the image blocks in a predetermined fashion. Only a portion of each image blocks is considered for watermarking embedding and the remaining parts are used as a guard band with the adjacent blocks. The experimental results have shown that the impact of attacks has reduced to a large extend by employing the above mentioned procedure which in turn has significantly improved the security and robustness of the proposed watermarking scheme.

abstract,"Abstract Now a day’s an important source of information is social media, which reports any major event including natural disasters. Social media also includes conversational data. As a result, the volume of data on social media has an enormous increase. During the time of natural disaster like floods, tsunami, earthquake, landslide etc., people require information in those situations, so that relief operations like help, medical facilities can save many lives (Goswami et al. in Ain Shams Eng J, 2016). An attempt is made in this article on Geoparsing which will identify the places of disaster on a Map. Geoparsing is a process of converting free text description of locations into the geographical identifier in an unambiguous manner with the help of longitude and latitude. With the help of geographical coordinates, it can be mapped and entered into geographical information system (GIS). A real-time, reliable at robust twitter messages which are the source of the information can handle a large amount of data. After collecting tweets at the real time we can parse them for the disaster situation and its location. This information will help to identify the exact location of the event. For knowing information on the natural disaster, tweets are extracted from twitter to R-Studio environment. First the extracted tweets from twitter are parsed using R about “natural disaster”. Later we parsed the tweets and store in.CSV format in R database. For all posted data tweets are calculated and stored in a file. Later visual analysis is performed for the data store using R Statistical Software. Further, it is useful to assess the severity of the natural disaster. Sentiment analysis (Rahmath in IJAIEM 3(5):1–3, 2014) of user tweets is useful for decision making (Rao et al. in Int J Comput Sci Inf Technol 6(3):2923–2927, 2015)."

abstract,"Abstract Cooperative nature in multiagent system inculcates more understanding and data by sharing the resources. So cooperation in a multiagent system gives higher efficiency and faster learning compared to that of single learning. However, there are some challenges in front of learning in a cooperative manner in the multiagent system that needs to pay attention. Making effective cooperative decisions that correctly and efficiently solve interacting problems requires agents to closely cooperate their actions during problem-solving. So various  issues related with cooperative machine learning are implemented. Reinforcement learning is mainly implemented with game theory and robot applications. Paper gives the new approach for reinforcement learning methods applied to the diagnostic application. The novelty of the approach lies in the amalgamation two methods i.e. weighted strategy sharing with expertness parameter that enhances the learning performance. Weighted strategy method is implemented with Sarsa (λ), Q(λ) and Sarsa learning for cooperation between the agents that was not implemented previously. Cooperative learning model with individual and cooperative learning is given in this paper. Weighted Strategy Sharing algorithms calculate the weight of each Q table based upon expertness value. Variation of WSS method with Q-learning and Sarsa learning is implemented in this paper. The paper shows implementation results and performance comparison of Weighted Strategy Sharing with Q-learning, Q(λ), Sarsa learning and Sarsa(λ) algorithms."

In this work we presented a web based e-learning system that is completely concerned with the sign language. In Pakistan, there is a scarcity of sign language resources available to assist deaf children in strengthening the language skills necessary for academic advancement. Thus, e-Learning for hearing impaired people is an application developed not only for deaf children but also for normal people to communicate with the deaf people. It is a web based application focusing on sign language of Pakistan which allows non-vocal information exchange. The purpose of this research work is twofold. First is to provide an e-learning system for educating sign language to deaf/hard-of-hearing people of Pakistan. Secondly, to develop a text translation system to translate English into its equivalent Pakistani sign language gestures in order to overcome communication barriers. The system also contains feedback for improving the quality of application by taking suggestions from normal and disable people. The proposed application is distributed in modular client server entities; the framework is specially designed for parents to edify their children the indispensable communication skills. We believe that proper communication lays the foundation for accelerated learning and reduced frustration."

abstract,"Abstract Internet of things (IOT) paradigm is changing day to day lives towards sophisticated automation and enhancing living standards of our societies. The most of “Things” in IOT are having limited power, storage, and computational capabilities. Therefore data is collected, manipulated and stored in the clouds. The benefit of “anytime and anywhere” access of data gives rise to serious security and privacy issues and lead to many problems like exposure of user’s personal and sensitive information and loss of the trust between parties. These challenges need to be addressed with adequately with utmost care. From an operational point of view, the major concern for IOT is “Privacy”. In this article, we discuss difference between privacy and security. Further, and present several approaches and techniques that are being used to fulfill the privacy requirements. This comparative study also contains advantages and disadvantages of the mentioned approaches. Finally, we discuss the future opportunities, trends, and provide recommendations about the privacy for IOT based applications and services."

abstract,"Abstract Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a distributed wireless network with highly dynamic topology. So, the nodes keep moving in and out of the network instantly. A path formed between two distant nodes through several intermediate nodes cannot be maintained for a long duration of time. But, the availability of the link between any two nodes can be predicted up to a certain extent by using the available resources in the network, such as the power, bandwidth and delay, etc. Even then the guaranteed data delivery through the path cannot be made. Therefore, reliable multicast routing in MANET is a challenging issue. Thus, in this paper, we have proposed to design a multi-constrained reliable multicast routing protocol (MRMRP) using network coding. This technique builds the reliable path between the source and a multicast receivers. The reliable path between the nodes will be constructed by estimating residual power,bandwidth and delay then network coding scheme is used to recover the lost packet during data transmission. Results  of our experiments show the performance improvements in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as end-to-end delay, control overhead, packet loss and delivery ratio in comparison with an MAODV and routing technique proposed by Chi et al."

abstract,"Abstract Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a hot area of research which is useful in countless applications in various fields of engineering and technology. In WSN wireless nodes are dispersed in a well confined area, and most of the times are static once they are deployed. These nodes are battery operated and their energy goes down as they transmit beacon or informative packets. In past many routing protocols are proposed which tries to minimize the energy dissipation by using various approaches. Till date in proposed protocols information is transmitted in each round, however in many applications such frequent information/update is not desirable, therefore to restrict transfer of packets in each round in this paper a load based transmission control protocol is proposed, where by varying the load, transfer of packets can be controlled, and this mechanism reduces the dissipation of energy and thus improves, stability period, network lifetime and throughput. The performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is done using MATLAB software and keys features of proposed protocol are highlighted."

abstract,"Abstract Classifying spam is a topic of ongoing research in the area of natural language processing, especially with the increase in the usage of the Internet for social networking. This has given rise to the increase in spam activity by the spammers who try to take commercial or non-commercial advantage by sending the spam messages. In this paper, we have implemented an evolving area of technique known as deep learning technique. A special architecture known as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a variant of the Recursive Neural Network (RNN) is used for spam classification. It has an ability to learn abstract features unlike traditional classifiers, where the features are hand-crafted. Before using the LSTM for classification task, the text is converted into semantic word vectors with the help of word2vec, WordNet and ConceptNet. The classification results are compared with the benchmark classifiers like SVM, Naïve Bayes, ANN, k-NN and Random Forest. Two corpuses are used for comparison of results: SMS Spam Collection dataset and Twitter dataset. The results are evaluated using metrics like Accuracy and F measure. The evaluation of the results shows that LSTM is able to outperform traditional machine learning methods for detection of spam with a considerable margin."

abstract,"Abstract Median filter is one of the established filters to de-noised impulse noise. Median filter determine median of a predefine mask. Sometimes estimated intensity of median filter again produces noise. Consider a pixel with 8-connected neighbors (255, 255, 255, 150, 255, 255, 100, 10, 90). If median filter is applied, then estimated intensity will be 255 i.e. 5th largest elements which is again noise. Hence in proposed work ‘at least half’, ‘as many as possible’, and ‘most’ fuzzy linguistic quantifier are used to de-noise images corrupted by impulse noise. In proposed work infrared image of ship with impulse noise is used as input. The impulse noise is inserted with a probability of 0.01. The ‘most’ quantifier produces more promising results than other two quantifiers. SNR ratio of proposed filter is much closer to original image as compare to median filter. Moreover, performance is verified for different types of images. Nevertheless, the performance of proposed method is found satisfactory."

abstract,"Abstract A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is formed when group of mobile wireless nodes collaborate between them to communicate through wireless links in the absence of the fixed infrastructure and any centralized control. These characteristics make it able to adapt and operate in difficult conditions. It is vital to keep the topology stable as long as possible. An effective clustering scheme renders longer cluster lifetime and incurs low maintenance overhead. However, the mobility of nodes adversely affects the hierarchical structure. Therefore, electing nodes with small relative velocity with respect to it’s 1-hop downlink neighbors or cluster members, for the role of cluster head is a preferred option that makes the clusters more stable. In the proposed scheme FESC, we present a relatively stable clustering scheme by considering more powerful however less mobile (w.r.t. the cluster members) nodes as cluster heads. The cluster heads can themselves estimate the competency value of the cluster. If it is small enough, then it advises the nodes with other cluster options to join some better clusters so that they don’t arbitrarily join and leave available clusters. The simulation analysis confirms that our scheme delivers more stable clusters with low maintenance effort."

abstract,"Abstract The societal costs accompanying the developments are usually related to traffic congestion and accidents. The condition can be enhanced by providing timely information on traffic conditions using vehicular ad-hoc networks. vehicular ah hoc network (VANET), which is an essential technology in the realization of intelligent transportation system (ITS), has key challenges such as infrequent link connection duration and high packet drop ratio. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed which provides security against attacks on routing protocols and better network connectivity. In this algorithm, attacker node or the chain of attacker node can be identified, and IPs of these attacker nodes are blacklisted which implies if any RREP (route reply packet)come from the blacklisted node then that RREP will be discarded. The proposed algorithm is implemented using NCTUns network simulator and comparison of leading VANET protocols ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), B-AODV (AODV with black hole attack) with the proposed secured algorithm is done. Extensive simulation scenarios are considered, and final results show that proposed algorithm has 40% higher throughput in comparison to AODV protocol, which makes it more efficient in a dense vehicular environment having V2V communication. Also, the proposed algorithm has 10% lower packet drop and a lesser number of collisions which renders it more reliable for the vehicle vehicle (V2V) environment. It proves that proposed secured routing algorithm performs better than standard AODV in the presence of malicious nodes causing black hole attack."

abstract,"Abstract In future communication networks with Internet of Things (IoT), each of the smart devices will be able to communicate with other smart devices ubiquitously throughout the time clock. These smart devices contain limited amount of energy, memory, and processing power. Additionally, short range radios are very susceptible to noise, multi route distortion, and interference. In this context this paper proposes an energy efficient link stable routing (EELSR) to conserve energy of the smart devices and to account link stability for enhancing the network lifetime. In order to verify the correctness of the proposed routing, first, analytical models for link stability, and residual energy of a route have proposed, second, an optimal route selection algorithm that uses residual energy of a route, link stability of a route, and route distance, has been designed. The performance of the proposed EELSR is evaluated and compared with AODV and REL in the terms of network life time, packet delivery ratio, routing success probability, and route setup delay. EELSR outperforms the state of art routing algorithms."

abstract,"Abstract Data and computational centres consume a large amount of energy and limited by power density and computational capacity. As compared with the traditional distributed system and homogeneous system, the heterogeneous system can provide improved performance and dynamic provisioning. Dynamic provisioning can reduce energy consumption and map the dynamic requests with heterogeneous resources. The problem of resource utilization in heterogeneous computing system has been studied with variations. Scheduling of independent, non-communicating, variable length tasks in the concern of CPU utilization, low energy consumption, and makespan using dynamic heterogeneous shortest job first (DHSJF) model is discussed in this paper. Tasks are scheduled in such a manner to minimize the actual CPU time and overall system execution time or makespan. During execution, the load is balanced dynamically. Dynamic heterogeneity achieves reduced makespan that increases resource utilization. Some existing methods are not designed for fully heterogeneous systems. Our proposed method considers both dynamic heterogeneities of workload and dynamic heterogeneity of resources. Our proposed algorithm provides the better results than existing algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been simulated on CloudSim."

abstract,"Abstract The newly emerged concept of dedicated servers for virtual machines in Cloud Data Centres has motivated researchers’ community to think more critically on optimal utilization of host resources. VMs hosted on dedicated servers are not allowed to migrate during their lifetime, thus it is very important for service providers to adopt that VM allocation policy which utilizes the resources of servers in an optimal way in order to improve the performance of whole data centre. Efficient utilization of resources of data centre is quite challenging due to unpredictability of workload. Host machines in a cloud data centre deal with heterogeneous VMs which have different RAM and CPU requirements. Compute intensive VMs require more computing power than RAM where as data intensive VMs require less computing power than RAM. Similarly other VMs like Small and Micro too have different RAM and computing capacity requirements. An improper VM allocation policy to place different types of VMs in hosts, sometimes leads to uneven usage of host resources and results in wastage of Hosts’ resources like RAM and computing power. In the present work, a novel VM allocation policy has been proposed that allocates VMs to hosts keeping in view the RAM and CPU consumption of host in a proportionate way. It uses the concept of skewness to measure the unevenness in usage of host resources and allocates VM to that host machine which has least skew value. Experimental results obtained through simulation are compared with the Simple First Fit and Power Aware Best Fit Decreasing (PABFD) Policies. It has been found that proportionate usage of RAM and CPU capacity of the host machine accommodates more VMs and reduces the total energy consumption of the data centre. It also outperforms PABFD in terms Energy Consumption and Number of Hosts shutdown."

abstract,"Abstract Magnetic disk drives have been used as standard storage devices in computer systems for a long time now. Since their inception in 1956 to current date, they faced many technological challenges to meet the varied storage demands of diverse systems. During their technological journey, they received many advances to improve their capacity, performance, cost, and so on. Unfortunately, their success story is always told through one single perspective, i.e. advancements to improve capacity, performance, cost, and other such features. The capacity barriers in hard disks, which surfaced after the introduction of ATA drives and Zone-bit recording, and the attempts to overcome them are seldom brought to light. This paper attempts to fill this gap in literature. The paper investigates the reasons behind the capacity barriers faced by hard disk technology between 1994 and 2001, discusses the consequences of these barriers, explains the solutions devised and highlights their flaws, and deduces the knowledge that can be used in future storage technologies to avoid such problems."

The goal of this paper is to detect, to identify the early symptoms of rust disease at the microscopic level. The performance of various preprocessing, feature extraction and classification techniques was evaluated on microscopic images. Finally support vector machine classifier was used to detect the leaf disease of Pea Plant. The proposed system can successfully detect and examined disease with accuracy of 89.60%. Focus has been done on the early detection of rust disease at microscopic level which avoids spreading of disease not only on the whole plant but also to the other plants."

Because of dynamics of different aspects of ASD, it is very difficult to keep track, maintain and estimate the overall product. So, in order to solve the effort estimation problem (EEP) in ASD, different types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied. This work focuses on two types of ANN-feedforward back-propagation neural network and Elman neural network. These two networks have been applied to a dataset which contains project information of 21 projects based on ASD from 6 different software houses to analyze and solve the EEP. Also, the proposed work uses three different performance metrics i.e. mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE), mean square error (MSE) and prediction (PRED(x)) to examine the performance of the model. The results of the proposed models are compared to the existing models in the literature."

abstract,"Abstract In last few years, information world has come across one of the most appealing paradigms, namely Internet-of-Things (IoT). Both the industry as well as the academia is fascinated by the open issues and research challenges of Internet-of-Things. The enormity in the development, expansion, and advantages of the paradigm is unbelievable, and this results in the transition of the information world to this paradigm. At the same time, it raises the security concerns along with many other open issues towards the paradigm. This paper specifically focuses on the confidentiality component out of the three components of security triad, namely confidentiality, integrity and availability. Although researchers have high interest towards all the three components, but the questions posed by many researchers, academicians and end users raise major issues over ‘confidentiality’. Confidentiality is all about guaranteeing the authentic access to a piece of information or a service or even a resource, to a particular individual or computing device. The resource in question may be one of the resources of an IoT system. This can be achieved by deploying some authentication techniques. Here we discuss various types of authentication techniques, purposely putting our emphasis on one of the well-known authentication technique, viz. passwords. This work reviews the existing techniques, their drawbacks and claimed advantages of the upcoming password techniques. It also surveys some of the supportive methods for the naïve users of password techniques. This paper aims at classifying, comparing and encapsulating the problems, demanded solutions and suggestions from relevant published technical and review articles in the field of authentication. This paper particularly highlights graphical password schemes. This proposes a naïve graphical password scheme to assure the authentic access of IoT resources, namely TCpC. At the end we have mentioned the advantages of TCpC over other authentication schemes. We have also compared and analyzed the different proposed password schemes with our technique."

The trust value of sensor node is calculated as per the deviation of key factors at the physical layer. The proposed scheme is effective to identify the abnormal nodes in WSNs. The abnormal nodes mainly attack the physical layer by denial of service attack. They use the jamming attack by consuming the resources of the genuine nodes, which leads to a denial of service. To analyze the performance of PL-IDS, we have implemented the periodic jamming attack. Results  show that PL-IDS performs better in terms of false alarm rate and malicious node detection accuracy rate."

Vehicles carry communication modules, computing facility, storage, Internet accessing capability and equipped with application specific sensors in the on-board unit. Recently, vehicular cloud computing is a technology that is embedded with vehicular networks to solve many vehicular networking issues and challenges like storage, computing, information gain, internet access, network, security, etc. In this paper, we consider the storage as a service (STaaS) issue in vehicular networks. The vehicles in the parking lots are used as a data center to store the information of the user. However, providing this service to the users requires a scheduling policy to give the storage service in a minimum time. Therefore, we develop a new scheduling policy, called TSP-HVC for STaaS in the vehicular cloud environment. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling policy produces less makespan and high average resource utilization than the well-known min–min and max–min cloud scheduling policies."

abstract,Abstract Estate property management system mainly deals with geographical area with associated information for monitoring and managing estate properties. Geographic Information System (GIS) has potential to handle spatial and aspatial data in a single platform which makes GIS a favourable choice for estate property management system. The availability of free and open source GIS helped this technology affordable and popular in large number of applications. Hence there is a demand to develop a new or upgrade an existing non-GIS based system to a GIS based property management system. In this paper a novel case study is presented where an Oracle based system is integrated with GIS platform using freeware ArcGIS Explorer (AGX) customization. The integration of dynamic data from Oracle server is challenging due to non-supportive database type in AGX. The issue is overcome by introducing an intermediate file handling mechanism in the GIS interface using Oracle client in .net frame work. The proposed system can run in multiple nodes in a local area network and capable of fetching data from Oracle server. It serves user queries on both spatial and aspatial data that enables spatial visualisation of aspatial data.

abstract,"Abstract Self-Organizing teams have been studied in various forms and they are considered as an autonomous team operating with minimal dependencies. With the advent of agile methodologies in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the focus shifted to the team attributes that lead to successful project delivery as compared to the individual attributes only. Agile methodologies are considered as another alternative process as compared to traditional software engineering practices for developing software products and systems. The focus on emphasizing and integrating people and team factors into the software development process forms a core part of agile development. This paper investigates the contemplation of the agile team as a complex adaptive system (CAS) for improved probability of successful project delivery. This is discussed as an important attribute while identifying the key characteristics of agile teams as part of an overall framework of the important characteristics of an agile team that leads to successful project delivery."

The process of executing the most beneficial test case is called as test case prioritization. The redundant test cases which detect the same mutants can be eliminated for minimization, which results in reducing the cost and time of regression testing. This paper presents a code based prioritization technique in which total statement coverage, total fault exposing potential award and total mutant coverage is taken as prioritization factors to prioritize test cases for software under test. In the proposed method, Genetic Algorithm is used for prioritization and further test cases are minimized based on total mutant coverage. The effectiveness of the prioritized order is measured by Average Percentage of Statement Coverage metric."

abstract,"Abstract Ontology is an emerging technology in building knowledge based information retrieval systems. It is used to conceptualize the information in human understandable manner. Over the years, much importance was given to the systematic development of ontologies. As a result many methods and strategies to build ontology in different domains came up in the field of ontological engineering. These methods contained different steps to plan, design and build ontology efficiently. Most of these methods provided a generic structure to construct ontology. The development of ontology has cut across different domains and applications and this has arisen a need to develop methods to build ontologies in various applications. Nowadays, multilingual ontology applications are developed in various domains to have Knowledge based information retrieval according to the language preferred by user. Multilingual ontology allows sharing of information and data in different languages and thus facilitates multi-language users. A method to develop multilingual ontologies is in need now. In this paper, we propose an ontology mediation method to develop multilingual ontology applications. It explains the steps involved in the development process. A six step method is followed which is done iteratively to develop multilingual ontologies. Merging and mapping techniques are also used in mediation of multilingual ontologies. New algorithms are proposed for merging and mapping multilingual ontologies. The proposed method is experimented by developing multilingual ontology application for Thirukkural, the famous Tamil literature. The experimental results show that multilingual ontologies can be developed using the proposed method and semantic knowledge can be retrieved from the multilingual ontology."

The model has been used in a number of cases and have provided evidence of stability and clarity. Additionally, they have been used for the development of information systems either manually or through the use of tools such as model driven development frameworks and have proved to generate various artefacts such as design models and even prototype systems. While precise and informative they lack the ability to capture the dynamic aspects of the organizations. In this research, we propose the use of business process modeling notation as a visual language that can capture the invariant and dynamic constrains of the MEASUR’s ontology charts."

abstract,"Abstract A service oriented architecture platform consists of distributed web services (WSes). A system needs dynamic composition of WSes. Reliability of a composition process requires detection of faults and tolerance to the faults. A composition process can end abruptly due to occurrence of faults. Present paper proposes a quality of service (QoS) based fault-detection and fault-tolerance approach using the dynamic orchestration. The approach also considers the QoS of WSes and user preferences at runtime. The approach uses reliability in two-phases. Firstly, a trust based web-service filtering mechanism is used. This achieves reliability at the component level before a fault occurs. Next, whenever a fault detects in a process, a decision for dynamic recovery is taken. That is based on the optimum QoS ranking of the WSes. The steps in the proposed approach provide the reliability at the component as well as composition level. They work for all the orchestration based composition models. An implementation followed by experimental-study shows that the proposed approach produces timely as well as optimal results in the presence of the faults."

abstract,"Abstract Alzheimer Disease is one of the neuro-degenerative diseases and most expensive disease in the modern society characterized by cognitive, intellectual as well as behavioral disturbance. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is a major concern due to increasing population and lack of a standard and effective diagnosis. Although EEG is a powerful and relatively cheap tool for diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and dementia; it still not achieves the standards of clinical performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity to accept as a reliable technique for screening of Alzheimer disease. Hence, there is scope for increase in performance of EEG based diagnosis. This paper focuses on Electroencephalography based diagnosis and complexity based features for early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. From the results, it is observed that the EEG of the Alzheimer patients slows down and it is less complex as that compared to the Normal patients. In this study, different complexity based features such as Spectral Entropy, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Roll-off and Zero Crossing Rate are used. K nearest Neighbor classifier is used for classifying the data between two groups i.e. Normal and Alzheimer disease patients giving accuracy of 96% in present research work."

abstract,"Abstract Routing issues pertaining to Mobile adhoc networks (MANET) have been under scrutiny over the past many years. The rigorous researches have yielded proactive and reactive protocols but with various pros and cons in different network conditions. A set of protocols combining the advantages of both reactive and proactive were designed to handle security and QOS issues. Out of the hybrid protocols, ZRP has emerged as a highly capable hybrid routing protocol with limited proactive scope due to the formation of zones. However, the existence of overlapping zones and a few more hindrances leave some scope for modifications, required to enhance the performance of ZRP. This paper focuses to resolve the drawback by aggregating the routes into a central entity chosen randomly. The algorithm for synthesizing route aggregation in ZRP starts with formation of additional zones where the participating nodes act as members of the aggregation. Then the zone head is selected for the newly formed nodes, followed by aggregation of all the routes and then buffering them to the link state table. This process is stopped with the active zone head otherwise the above procedure is continued."

Ontology plays a major role in the retrieval of semantic data. The researcher has already constructed the string instrument ontology using protégé 5.0, which helps in refining the web search in music domain. The researcher has proposed a novel approach for ontology management in which the ontology is continuously updated using the knowledge extracted/discovered from the analysis of the log file (specifically the data related to the referrer field) in form of new concepts and new relationships between new and/or existing concepts. The goal of this study is to use data mining algorithms to analyse visitors and visited web pages of the website and somehow characterise or distinguish them in some way. During this the researcher has collected ‘guitar’ web access log from guitar selling website of 363 days of the year 2016. After pre-processing of this log file, two new feature sets have been extracted from ‘guitar’ log file and constructed two files namely ‘File1’ and ‘File 2’. File 2 is also known as query log. Further clustering (EM), association rule finding (Apriori) and sequential patterns (n-gram) algorithms have been applied for suggestions of new concepts to continuously update and improve the existing ontology from time to time."

abstract,"Abstract The epidemic growth of internet services has created a broad attention on digital content authentication and copyright protection. Heading the issue we are going to propose a DCT based novel approach on invisible video watermarking along with an improved video key-frame extraction algorithm. In this article first the key-frames (video bookmarks) of the video sequence are being extracted. In order to identify the video bookmarks, a novel method is proposed based on boundary luminosity analysis that is proven efficient regarding fast camera movement and moving objects in the video frames. A pair of secret keys will be applied during the watermark embedding phase. Our framework embeds watermarks in only those video frames which have been identified as key-frames of that video stream because, the key-frames are mostly kept as it is in different compression algorithms. The low frequency DCT coefficients of key-frames are chosen for watermarking, that again offers robustness to the compression algorithms. Instead of embedding watermark bits directly, a new method is proposed- scaled average. The watermark is perceptually invisible in the video key-frames according to human visual system. At last uncompressed video is re-reconstructed with all frames of the video in appropriate order of appearance. The watermark extraction is blind i.e., except the keys nothing is needed for watermark extraction."

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm makes use of an Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm to compute the zeroth, first and second order statistics pertaining to the UBM model for final extraction of I-Vectors. This high dimensional supervector is transformed into a low dimensional subspace called the Total Variability space (TV subspace) following which a new vector set (called I-Vectors) in extracted using the UBM model and Baum-Welch statistics. A total of 110 I-Vectors are extracted for the given input data after undergoing Cholesky whitening. This newly created data is now used for classifying normal and dysphonia samples.

The proposed model relies on the induced hairpin formation property of naphthyridine dimer in a G–G mismatched DNA oligo strand which is integrated with a generalized gate design algorithm. Contribution of this work lies in the inclusion of features like single design strategy for any logic function, uniformity in representation of logic 0 and 1 throughout the simulation process and is cost and implementation effective with parallel processing capacity."

This paper presents an architecture-MwTExt, for automatic extraction of multi-word terms-MWTs from such expressions within un-annotated English documents. Natural Language Processing 
techniques such as Shallow parsing and syntactic structure analysis are used to extract MWTs, with specific focus on lexical patterns as (Noun Preposition Noun), (Noun Preposition Noun + Noun) and (Noun Preposition Noun Preposition Noun). The MWTs extracted can be further used to form compound concepts within Ontology. The lexical descriptions of MWTs are encoded in Web Ontology Language OWL/XML. MwTExt has been tested on Computer Science domain texts, and the results obtained are compared with those obtained by Text2Onto, an Ontology learning tool and term extractors such as TermRaider and TerMine. The result signifies that MwTExt performs better for extraction of accurate lexicalized MWTs with average precision of 97%."

Among various multipath protocols, Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing algorithm is a standard one. Among the recent advancements to AOMDV, MMRE-AOMDV (Minimal Maximal Nodal Residual Energy—AOMDV) is state-of-the-art from the perspective of energy efficiency. In this article, we propose ERL-AOMDV which investigates deeper than residual energy of nodes. What it emphasizes is that expected residual lifetime of nodes and approximate completion time of a communication session are important to elect optimum routes. First three optimum routes are used for transferring data packets. Simulations results show that ERL-AOMDV performs significantly better than ordinary AOMDV and MMRE-AOMDV."

abstract,"Abstract The success of an institution depends on its ability to acquire accurate and timely data about its operations, to manage and use this data effectively. Computer laboratory record management plays a vital role in the organization and maintenance of computers in an institution. In existing system of Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro lab assistants are responsible to view the current status and configuration of individual computers in LAN based computer labs. The other and very important problem which lab assistants face is that they don’t know automatically which hardware and software changes are being done on any system. In this paper a Computer Laboratory Record Management System (CLRMS) is proposed to avoid such kind of problems. CLRMS is a network based Software which automatically keeps all the information of system including hardware and software. This software secures the records of system configuration for future information reporting, user management and security management. It also updates system database if any hardware is removed or any software changes occur via automatically retrieval method. CLRMS interfaces are easily understandable hence user friendly. It generates reports for both software and hardware. It shows complete structured configuration of a computer. It will keep records that which type of user was log on the system and what tasks he has performed like installation information of software, updates of software, version and vendor information."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, comparative analysis of code performance of distinct optical 2-D codes belonging to the Prime code family have been examined. Various optical 2-D Prime codes such as Low-weight Prime sequence code (LW-PSC), Modified prime-hop code (MPHC), Extended prime-hop code (E-CHPC), Transposed-modified prime code (T-MPC), Transposed-sparse padded modified prime code (T-SPMPC) are considered. Hard-limiting Error Probability (HEP) equations of these codes are used to scrutinize the performance of these codes. Performance of one of the 2-D Prime codes, more specifically MPHC performs best in OCDMA systems where only Multi-user interference effect is considered. This optical 2-D MPHC code possesses very low BER value as compared to universally accepted standard with the increasing user count. MPHC provides robustness to multiple user interference affected OCDMA therefore very much apt for applications where simultaneous access of immense number of active user is required."

abstract,"Abstract This paper is a part of the research work done to develop a machine translation system (MTS) to convert Hindi text into Dogri. The process of machine translation includes various key activities such as preprocessing, POS tagging, transliteration, word order alignment, translation, morphological analysis, etc.; but it is not mandatory to include all of them in every MTS. The inclusion of these activities varies depending on the languages undertaken and also the approach used for its development. The first and the foremost step for the development of any MTS, is to study and analyze the languages undertaken. This paper presents a comparative study of Hindi and Dogri keeping in view machine translation. This study has helped in the selection of the approach of translation, the preprocessing activities to be applied on the source text, for developing rules for inflectional analysis and other activities to be done for processing some special cases pertaining to Dogri. The grammatical and inflectional analysis of Hindi and Dogri is presented in this paper."

abstract,"Abstract Sensor networks are an apt amalgamation of sensing, processing and communication. These networks are formed using tiny inexpensive sensor nodes which have the attributes of low processing power and short radio ranges. They steer themselves to numerous applications and at the same instance, encounter stark energy constraints and face scarce memory resources. The discerning personas of sensor networks also have a direct influence on the hardware design of these nodes. Innumerable hardware platforms like Crossbow, Intel, and IvMote have been fabricated to examine the ideas of the research community and to implement applications in all arenas of science and technology. With so many applications designed in this area, security issues are of paramount importance. In this article, security architectures on the two layers of the network stack—link layer and network layer have been surveyed. The paper surveys the various security requirements for designing a wireless sensor network discussing the architecture of the protocols in comparison with the security primitives of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless sensor network (Shon and Choi in Towards the implementation of reliable data transmission for 802.15.4-based wireless sensor. Ubiquitous intelligence and computing, 5061. Lecture notes in computer science, 363–372, 2008). The paper examines TinySec (Karlof et al. in TinySec: a link layer security architecture for wireless sensor networks. In: Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on embedded networked sensor systems, 2004) a standard protocol used in TinyOS; the operating system deployed in sensor networks; and C-Sec (Moh’d et al. in C-Sec: energy efficient link layer encryption protocol for wireless sensor networks. In: Proceedings in consumer communications and networking conference (CCNC), 2012) at the link layer and MiniSec (Luk et al. in iniSec: a secure sensor network communication architecture. In: Proceedings of the 6th international conference on information processing in sensor networks (IPSN ‘07), New York, 2007) and MoteSec-Aware (Tsou et al. in IEEE Trans Wirel Commun 12(6):2817–2829, 2013) at the network layer. The survey focusses on the vulnerabilities dealt by each protocol, their challenges with respect to energy consumption, scalability and availability. It also highlights the challenges that the protocols have not been able to handle because of resource restrictions. It also projects some future research directions in the area of security."

abstract,"Abstract Network security is used to monitor and prevent unauthorized access, deployment, enhancement, or contradiction of a network of computers. Network security is a primary issue in processing on the grounds that numerous assortments of assaults are expanding step by step. Despite the fact that, more number of research works were completed in the past for system security yet at the same time there are numerous testing issues. To address the issues in the existing literature, the probability clomp algorithm has been proposed to form the cluster and intrusion unearthing algorithm has been implemented among the clustering environment. The execution of the proposed Intrusion Detection System recognizes the interruption significantly more successfully than the current frameworks. The quality of the cluster is measured with the help of attributes like precision and entropy which is compared with the existing approach. The proposed algorithm is able to achieve high observations and detection to overcome the disadvantages of existing algorithm."

abstract,"Abstract In the present scenario, every user is not familiar with the use of Structured Query Language (SQL). So, user is not able to understand or write complex queries in SQL. An enhanced application with intelligent interface is needed to improve communication between the naïve user and the databases application. The database is an efficient structure for handling data. To understand the structure of the database, a user has to learn SQL. The non-expert users who are not familiar with the use of SQL, need a system by which the user can interact with the database in their natural language. The system must have the ability to understand the natural language and interact with the database accordingly. In this research, an improved system with three-tier architecture is developed. Pattern matching and semantic matching techniques are used to develop the system which transforms natural language into SQL queries. The SQL query is generated with the production rules and the predefined data dictionary. The predefined data dictionary contains semantics for attributes and relation among attributes. The input given by the user is transformed by the system into SQL query by passing through steps like tokenization, escape word removal, classification of elements and query formation. Finally, the output is in the form of a SQL query. The results are compared with the existing system. The results given by the proposed system are better than the existing system. The proposed system has better recall value, accuracy, and precision in comparison to existing systems."

abstract,"Abstract It has become increasingly crucial and imperative to facilitate knowledge extraction for decision support and deliver targeted information to analysts that span wide application domains. Interestingly, the buzzing term “big data” which is estimated to be 90% unstructured further makes it difficult to tap and analyze information with traditional tools. Text mining entails defining a process which transforms and substitutes this unstructured data into a structured one to discover knowledge. Use of classification algorithms to intelligently mine text has been studied extensively across literature. This study predominantly surveys the text classification algorithms employed in the process of mining unstructured data to report a conclusive analysis on the trend of their use in terms of their respective strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT). The scope of these algorithms is then explored apropos the application area of sentiment analysis, a typical text classification task. A mapping which determines the unexplored social media technologies and the extent of use of these algorithms within respective social media is proffered to give an insight to the amount of work that has been done in the domain of machine learning based sentiment analysis on social media."

abstract,"Abstract Designing an optimal neural network architecture plays an important role in the performance of a neural network model. In the past few years, various bio-inspired optimization techniques have been applied to find the optimal architecture of a neural network model. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique has been applied with recurrent neural network long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm to find an optimal architecture for feed forward neural network. To optimize the architecture of neural network model Parameters considered are hidden neurons, learning rate and activation function. Fitness function applied for the selection of the optimal combination of the parameters is root mean square error (RMSE). Due to privatization of education number of private institutes and universities are increasing rapidly every year. This increase has resulted in huge number of data (NAAC reports) regarding the assessment and accreditation of higher education institutions. Dataset of 500 educational institutes has been collected from the official site of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). Hybrid model of PSO with LSTM algorithm has been applied to the educational dataset. Selection of the optimal architecture is done on the basis of RMSE, Accuracy and other performance parameters."

abstract,"Abstract This study aims at highlighting unicast routing techniques and their performance under different traffic arrival distributions. It is imperative to implement routing technique supporting resilience as single failure in high-speed networks even for fraction of second can disrupt millions of users. In this paper, Routing techniques such as session, distance vector, LS (link state) have been compared on basis of average E2E (end to end) delay, throughput, and jitter. In this investigation, four diverse traffic models CBR (constant bit rate), exponential, Poisson and Pareto have been considered with respect to user datagram protocol. It is observed that LS routing with Poisson traffic has least average E2E delay of 5.13 ms under single link failure and no failure in network. Network achieves best throughput of 1789.40 Kbps for session routing with CBR traffic. Network offers least jitter of 0.0002 ms for session routing with Poisson traffic. On occurrence of single link failure, maximum throughput and least jitter are achieved by session routing with Pareto traffic and CBR traffic respectively. The investigations in this paper provide insight into the selection of appropriate routing technique and traffic distribution for a particular application meeting its quality of service requirements."

Every allocation policy maintains some parameter for provide service in extensive level by keep allocation of virtual machine between upper and lower threshold. But dynamic allocation of virtual machine may have deviation in host workload. To deal with this situation a methodology was adopted utilization threshold that provide absolute median deviation for setting up threshold. This methodology has a major impact on dynamic virtual machine allocation in cloud. The dynamic workload on a host occurs due change in VM requesting resources. Even we get effective utilization of virtual machine through median absolute policy still is some resource unallocated in host. For deal with this situation we introduce a Global cloud methodology, main role is to collect all unallocated resource from different resource and provide access to new VM request for increase resource utilization.

abstract,"Abstract Encryption is predominantly crucial in order to provide safeguard to sensitive data, specifically images, against any possible illegitimate access and transgressions. This paper presents to propose an optimized image encryption approach for secure image-based communication. The approach makes use of particle swarm optimization to receive optimized encryption effect and a chaotic map. Initially, the approach generates several encrypted images and chaotic Logistic map, where session key for map’s initial conditions are made dependent on pending plain-image. Subsequently, the encrypted images are served as particles and an initial assemblage to operate optimization through PSO. The optimized encrypted image is manifested by correlation coefficient relevant to contiguous pixels as fitness function. The simulation results of proposed encryption approach demonstrate that encrypted image exhibits high de-correlation of adjacent pixels along with other excellent encryption lineaments such as flat histograms, entropies, net pixel change rates, and unified average changing intensities."

Different methods have been developed for the analysis of the software requirements like “attributed goal oriented requirements analysis” method, “Knowledge acquisition for automated specification”, and, i* framework, etc. Based on our literature review, we identify that in these methods less attention is given to the selection and prioritization of the goals when multiple stakeholders participate in requirements analysis process; and also the detection of the discordances among the stakeholders under fuzzy environment. Therefore, to address this issue, we proposed a “fuzzy attributed goal oriented software requirements analysis” (FAGOSRA) by considering the multiple stakeholders (MS); and we call it FAGOSRA_MS method. Proposed method includes the following steps: step 1: use goal oriented method to elicit the functional goal (FG) and non-functional goal (NFG); step 2: collect stakeholder’s fuzzy assessment for each FG and NFG; step 3: detect the disagreement among stakeholders and goals; step 4: compute the ranking values of each goal. In the proposed method, different notations are defined before constructing the AND/OR graph. We have applied FAGOSRA_MS to select and prioritize the different sub-goals of Institute Examination System."

abstract,"Abstract This work proposes Lyapunov theory based Fuzzy/Neural Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers with guaranteed stability. We look at ways in which Lyapunov theory could be used to produce RL controllers wherein the control action is hybrid or Lyapunov constrained, resulting in self learning controllers that are optimal, effective and stable. Fuzzy systems and Neural networks have been used as generic function approximators to handle exponential rise in computational burden that arises when RL is extended to high dimensional/continuous state-action spaces. We propose two distinct approaches: (i) Hybridized fuzzy Lyapunov RL control by combining Fuzzy Q Learning methodology in a Lyapunov setting thereby guarantying stability, and (ii) Lyapunov constrained Neural RL control wherein the controller’s action set is constrained to satisfy Lyapunov stability condition. Incorporating Lyapunov theory based element in the action generation mechanism of an RL based controller guarantees stability. We implement our soft computing based Lyapunov RL on the two benchmark non linear problems: (a) inverted pendulum and (b) cart pole balancing. The results obtained and associated comparison with baseline Neural/Fuzzy Q-Learning based controllers bring out the advantage of our Lyapunov RL based scheme."

abstract,"Abstract Huge attention of the researchers is drawn by the wireless sensor network (WSN) due to its applicability in variety of applications. WSN has tiny size low powered device called sensors with an objective to monitor the area of interest. In many applications of WSN, it is impossible to modify the topology or to replace the battery based power supply of the sensor nodes. Hence elongation of network lifetime is required to meet the objective of setting up the network. In this paper, a zonal based clustering technique is proposed wherein the field is divided into zones. The selection of cluster head is dynamic so as to balance the load with even dissipation of power by the deployed Sensor Node. The proposed work is compared with DEEC, SEP, Z-SEP and LEACH protocol and simulation validates the protocol with elongated stability region and extended life time with more successful packet delivery to base station."

abstract,"Abstract Braille is the system invented for visually impaired peoples to capable them for written communication. The basic constructs of each natural language can be transited to corresponding Braille characters. Optical Braille recognition system is capable to read the Braille pattern images and convert it to corresponding language text. The images captures from portable camera devices and scanners are generally geometrically and visually disturbed images. In this paper, a disruption robust model is presented to improve the scope and accuracy of Braille character recognition system. The proposed framework improved the image visibility using SD adaptive filter and used the polar cosine transformation to resolve geometric misalignment. Later on grid mapper and binary encoder are applied on emboss enhanced character image for transforming it to binary coded array. Finally, the peered map on this binary character is implied to recognize the corresponding language text. The proposed framework is implemented on three different sample sets of Braille character and document images collected randomly from the web. The comparative evaluation against PCA (principal component analysis) and LDA (linear discriminant analysis) method shows that the proposed model significantly improved the accuracy of Braille character and document recognition."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of this review is to summarize, analyze various research studies and identify different research gaps regarding usability standards and models, usability evaluation methods, usability metric, usability at different phases of software development life cycle and application domains of usability. This systematic review of usability studies between 1990 and 2016 has been conducted and 150 studies are identified. We conclude that researchers have not reached at consensus w.r.t. software usability models. We identify that Efficiency, Effectiveness, Satisfaction, and Learnability are commonly addressed attributes in various existing software usability models and standards. Further, developers do not have sufficient knowledge to decide the appropriate usability evaluation method to use in given domain. On the contrary, Usability Testing, Heuristic Evaluation and Questionnaire are identified frequently used methods for usability evaluation. Our findings investigate different metrics and measurement approaches used for usability estimation. But, current methods for usability measurement in practice do not include all ISO and ANSI defined aspects of usability into a single metric. Although, we identify studies concerning the integration of usability and software engineering into a single framework with generalizable results, their practical implementation is still missing and significantly needed. Conversely, this study highlights the fact that around 71% of studies address usability related issues during Design-Phase of software development life cycle. At present, usability issues have been identified in various domains but around 33.82% of studies identify that usability evaluation approach is widely used in Web-Domain. "

abstract,"Abstract With the introduction of elasticity in optical networks, the bandwidth utilization can be adapted according to the demands and further, longer transmission reach and higher spectral-efficiency can also be provisioned. For transmission, the elastic optical networks (EONs) use flexible frequency grids and advanced modulation formats, which necessitates solutions to the routing and spectrum allocation methods. Existing studies on EONs assume the transmission reaches of considered modulation formats to be based on various factors. In the current work, the effect of transmission reach(s) of considered modulation format(s) on spectrum utilization in the EONs is investigated. The optimization problem is formulated as an integer linear program, and a heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain solutions to the problem. Further, extensive simulations are conducted, considering realistic assumptions and network topologies, and the obtained results demonstrate that the spectrum utilization in EONs is significantly affected by the considered modulation format’s transmission reach; however, the considered network topology’s size substantially affects the nature of the obtained results."

The current research study suggests that the work in this area is very limited in Indian context and therefore we have reviewed the existing work on ISL or similar biometrics for different languages. The scope of potential research in ISL biometrics is development of databases since there is no standard database for ISL biometrics. The paper recommends the directions and viable method that could lead to a robust biometrics which would be very useful communication means for hearing and speech impaired people. A database was created as sample and tested using a standard method, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) method and found that the database worked in ISL biometric system. The suggestions and anticipations of a organization working for deaf and dumb people have also been studied."

abstract,"Abstract Efficient organisation of business, small, medium or large, is to combine management concepts with information technology. This is what Business informatics is all about. These days it is unimaginable to have a successful business without the use of information technology. If an organisation wants to achieve business intelligence, there is no way to avoid the use of management information systems. Most medium to large organisations have social and community initiatives and programs as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) division. However, its functionality and reach in many organisations lacks use of available technology and systems. As a result, the response to and delivery of community and social services is often slow rendering the services ineffective and times obsolete. Aim of this article is to demonstrate how CSR functions can be designed and implemented as database solutions to make their delivery effective and efficient. Our description CSR is provided mainly in the case of the National Commercial Bank, a well-known and major bank of Saudi Arabia. However the business database solutions are generic and may be applicable in many providers be they banks or other institutions."

Despite that, these still present some challenges such as facial expressions, sad, pose, illumination, age changes, and noise etc. There is a need to develop such method that copes with these challenges and yields better results. This paper makes use of DCT-PCA combination to reduce the dimensionality and extract the features followed by Bat algorithm to yield a set of features that proves to be the best for face recognition under uncontrolled environment. On comparison with other meta-heuristics such as GA, PSO, and CS, the results disclose that the proposed method outperforms others even in the existence of noise also."

abstract,"Abstract Delay/disruption tolerant network (DTN) is a rising communication criterion distinguished by intermittent connectivity. Routing algorithms in DTN are developed with the simple hypothesis that all the participating nodes collaborate with each other in storing and forwarding packets. Due to lake of centralized authority, it is difficult to protect the network against non-cooperative nodes. There may be some malicious nodes which may disrupt the forwarding strategy and insert excessive spurious traffic in order to degrade the performance of the network. This kind of misbehavior is known as flooding attack. This paper addresses this issue by using encounter record based scheme along with the trust based scheme to prevent network against Flooding attack. Encounter record table is used to check the encounter history of the receiver node and a trust metric is used to evaluate legitimacy of the received messages. Simulation outcomes show that our proposed scheme reduces the spurious traffic into the network which gives increased results for delivery probability and reduced overhead ratio."

abstract,"Abstract Modeling visual attention mechanisms has been a very active area of research in past years owing to the challenges it poses. Many models exist, which have been successfully implemented in content based image retrieval systems. Owing to the vast quantities of image data available digitally, services for indexing or retrieving images based on queries have been gaining popularity. In this paper, a novel method is presented for image saliency detection using a more efficient color space model (performance-wise) based on the color distribution of the images instead of the primary visual features. It is done by combining global and local feature extraction into a single method of content detection within an image for purposes of image retrieval, which is proven to be more efficient, as well as taxonomy of various distance metrics used to identify local features. Furthermore, we gauge the performance of these metrics on a 9908 set of test images, based on their precision and recall. The paper has inferred the result by using a set of test images and evaluation methods that can serve to evaluate future metrics."

abstract,"Abstract Website development is becoming a growing concern for all organizations in this world. However the process and lifecycle involved in their development is still uncertain. The Web based system development usually involves more heterogeneous stakeholders as compared to traditional software’s development construction. The process models used for the development of websites stands borrowed from the traditional software development approaches. The process of website development involves several fields of web engineering and multimedia applications which require altogether a different skill set and development processes. The growth of web based system has been exponential. An estimated size of public web and deep web has reached to 40 billion pages and where the pages are assembled on the fly in response to the user requests touches between 400 and 750 billion pages, respectively. The web based system size is continuously expanding like the universe after the big bang. Many researchers and practitioners have noted the rapid growth of internet for commercial purposes since its birth in 1990’s. The web presence allows small companies to compete comparatively at par with large enterprises which increases keenness for every organization to develop a website. An increase in the amount of web development work, forces the designers/webmasters working in different website development houses to carry out work in a well planned and systematic manner. The concerned organizations and different web development houses must, however follow specific methodologies/standards/guidelines recommended by various organizations for advancement in present web development process models. The adoption of traditional methodologies of web development leads to the production of poorly designed web applications which show variable performance across different browsing platforms and have high probability failure rate. This propagates in the lack of confidence during web development and ultimately moves towards Web-Crisis. In order to avoid Web-Crises, there is a desperate need of designing and developing the newer process models that are especially concerned with website development. As such there is a need of disciplined approach towards the development of web-based systems. Researches also suggest that there is a non uniform approach in web based systems development. The authors suggest that a specialized model for web development needs to be designed and developed to satisfy the dynamic categories of the stakeholders present worldwide. This paper discussed about the various traditional software and web development models popularly used in developing web applications and their suitability and effectiveness is compared which leads to the development of a successful web based applications. Various reasons which differentiate the traditional software development from web system development have also been worked out. The presences of specific features recommended in proposed framework are also tested by available methodologies. Finally, an initial framework is proposed which caters to the need of specific web development process model."

abstract,"Abstract Power saving and high throughput are two key issues in the design of ad-hoc wireless networks with multiple users. In addition, ensuring a degree of fairness among competing end users plays an important role in performance of these networks. The utility function associated with a source node accurately exhibits the QoS demand for different user applications. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization model to explore the effect of three classes of utility functions on the application performance of ad-hoc networks. This model is used to study throughput, optimal power and fairness issues in multi-flow network design where multiple sources have to send data traffic to different destinations. Specifically, we compute optimal link transmission powers and optimal utility objective function values for two different ad-hoc topology scenarios. We verify the accuracy of our analysis through extensive simulations on CVX software. The simulation results indicate the comparison of three different utilities on the proposed model. In our scheme, transmission power control at physical layer reduces the average power consumption by approximately 79% compared to the classical layered design approach. Also, the maximum fairness achieved is above 99%, indicating the fair share of resources among different contending network commodities."

abstract,"Abstract For biometric identification or verification fingerprint images are most popular due to their uniqueness in nature. Image Enhancement Techniques (IETs) plays a vital role in Fingerprint Recognition (FPR) System and IETs are one of the most important stages in FPR system. Fingerprint images suffer problems related to brightness, poor contrast and blurring due to noise and motion etc. Fingerprint images may be corrupted and degraded due to variation in environmental conditions, skin, pressure on the sensors, and various other impression conditions. To overcome these problems, IETs are used. The main aim of implementing IET to the input image so that the visual quality or information contents are more suitable for a specific application or automated image processing. The performance of FPR system relies on the matching techniques that depend on the input fingerprint image quality and algorithm used. Depending upon the matching process there are various FPR system matching techniques. Enhancing the fingerprint images by IETs provide more reliable feature extraction information for the matching process. This paper presents an overview of various IETs used for FPR system, then types, applications and role in FPR system for researchers. A method is proposed which uses these techniques for better performance of the FPR system by improving the quality of fingerprint images using IETs."

Extensive research on various issues in real environment has reported that on-demand provision of resources in cloud where connectivity issue persists for heterogeneous communication channel, requires developers to consider network infrastructure and the environment, which is beyond certain control. In wireless mobile network, the network condition is always changeable and cannot be predicted neither controlled. In this paper resource provisioning and checking of continuous availability of resource to the clients has been carried out using a web based application software that uses cloud servers and data centers. Secondly, an improved security feature has been added to the mobile stations in a registered group to eliminate the unnecessary utilization of resource by unauthorized station which maliciously consumes bandwidth and other facility provided by the cloud provider. Simulation results show that the proposed system performs better than other similar approaches when compared with specific network parameters."

abstract,"Abstract Solar photo voltaic cell (PVC) has shown colossal potential in reducing the cost of electricity and is considered to be one of the cleanest green forms of renewable energy. The current standard material for transparent electrodes in solar PVC is indium tin oxide (ITO).

This paper, suggest that replacing ITO with mono-layer graphene in amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar PVC yields comparable performance. This paper further explores standard multiple junctions tandem a-Si:H/µc-Si:H micromorph solar PVC (msPVC) for better efficiency and proposes the use of graphene (G)–zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite electrode based msPVC (G-ZnOmsPVC) for better absorption. The modelling and characterisation is done on SILVACO-Atlas virtual fabrication tool.

abstract,"Abstract Tracking devices help the elderly patients to remain safe, secure and traceable in case of getting lost or in an emergency. This research work was conducted to evaluate the appropriateness of few commercially available tracking devices for aging people, by identifying their usefulness, efficiency, limitations and further improvements. Research involved two steps; literature review about two existing tracking devices simply termed device A and device B, followed by a performance and comparative analysis of the aforementioned devices by applying basic statistics on the results obtained from a questionnaire survey. Devices were used by two groups of people: aging (>70 year old) and middle-aged patients (less than 70 years old) who reported their satisfaction levels about the said devices on a scale of one to five. These devices were found helpful in reducing the dependency of the elderly on others and raised their privacy values. However, these were not recommended for severe memory loss or later stage of critical staged dementia patients because learning and memorizing the process of handling these devices can be difficult for them. Overall, the performance of device B outplayed device A while comparing all considered device parameters. The calling feature of device B appeared to be an appealing characteristic with mean satisfaction levels of 4.9 ± 0.32 and 4.7 ± 0.48 as reported by the middle-aged and aging groups, respectively. These devices will be helpful in decreasing unnecessary rush at health care centers or lost person reporting in police. In upcoming years, these devices can be developed to remotely monitor the movement of the patient."

abstract,"Abstract Most of the biometric techniques are conventional biometrics employing some neural network architecture consisting of suitable number of hidden layers in their training process. The recognition accuracy has no longer become a measure to ensure the method of recognition is robust. Robustness has also been attempted by using hybrid methods for training such as neuro-fuzzy method and applying some optimization technique. The traditional use of the learning concept has almost been saturated in the field of computer vision and face recognition. An emerging concept of learning method that is being researched internationally in several cognitive, computer vision and data classification tasks is deep learning, which is subfield of machine learning inspired by structure and function of artificial neural network. This paper suggests using deep learning in assessment of cognitive ability of human brain. We plan to train thousands of facial images into our image database. Deep learning was compared to shallow learning in face recognition task done for real time applications; cognitive ability assessment and inference for different age group and gender; study of reaction time, etc. A sample size of 380 persons was tested in real time deep learning based face recognition. Response time and correct identification were recorded that shows potent research scope of deep learning in assessment of cognitive ability of human brain at large scale. The cognitive ability of women was found more than that of women."

Next, the master share is embedded into a cover image using reversible integer-to-integer wavelet transform providing a two-tier security to the binary message. The performance is analyzed by calculating peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE) and cross-correlation coefficient (Rxy). Simulation results are also discussed for the cases when discrete cosine (DCT) and discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) are used in the second step."

The rigorous studies have been done to obtain modeling equations for characterizing beams deflection and frequency responses. The beam was designed with Si, Au, PZT-8 and PVDF-760 materials and simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics FEM model to investigate behavior of these beams in terms of deflection and frequencies by varying beam length ‘L’. Through the simulations and analytical results it was also observed that the resonant frequencies of the beam have less impact due to width and height but was mostly dependent on the length of the beam. These micro-cantilever beams are found very useful for designing MEMS sensors, resonators and oscillators for RF applications."

abstract,"Abstract  In this paper, we have investigated a possible single to multi-channel upgrade employing different amplification (Booster, EDFA amplifier and Raman amplifier). A 10 GB/s single channel signal is launched onto a fiber (D = 3 ps/nm/km) link of 140 km. The system works at the sensitivity limit. To upgrade the system, the power-budget at the receiver must increase employing an optical preamplifier. Two alternatives are explored: an EDFA or a RA. Two 10-channels WDM systems are shown employing respectively an EDFA and a Raman amplifier. EDFA gain and Rama amplifier counter propagating pump are determined to obtain the same optical gain for both the system configurations. A multiple run has been carried on to search the optimum RA configuration."

abstract,"Abstract Image processing plays an important role in getting information from medical images. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) provides invaluable information to the physicians which help in diagnosis of various diseases. MRI is a technology which enables the detection, diagnosis and evaluation. An automatic detection requires pre-processed image. Preprocessing makes the image segmentation more accurate. In preprocessing the noise removal, enhancement of image, artifact removal and skull stripping are carried out. The purpose of this article is to analyze the performance of three different enhancement methods on brain MRI images named contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, histogram equalization and brightness preserving dynamic fuzzy histogram equalization. These enhancement techniques are applied on Astrocytoma MR images and their performance is evaluated on the basis of quality metrics."

abstract,"Abstract E-government is a platform and method to provide government services to citizens as well as other residents of a country, through an internet enabled platform. Quite regularly the e-government services are analysed qualitatively and quantitatively, and the extent of success can be measured by the degree of customers’ engagement and satisfaction. Engagement and adoption of a service is a result of awareness, ability, social acceptance, sophistication and provision of the service. Earlier studies on this subject have revealed that lack of initiatives to create awareness, building trust and providing adequate training contributed to a lower rate of adoption and satisfaction. With a fast growth of technology and better infrastructure, situation can significantly change even in a short period. In this article, we analyse success and satisfaction levels of e-government adoption in Saudi Arabia. Our findings are based on qualitative as well as the result of an empirical study of responses of an extensive survey of customers of the west coast of Saudi Arabia, which includes the commercial city of Jeddah."

abstract,"Abstract Reliable, available and accessible IT services are crucial to the success and competitive position of an organisation. With increased use and rapid changes in emerging technologies, organizations require regular review of their disaster recovery plans. Given the complexity of IT systems, it very difficult to ensure correct and complete steps are taken for safeguarding these systems in unforeseen natural or man-made disasters events. A disaster recovery plan for IT systems consists of a large number of steps and processes. This makes it complex to the design, develop and monitor disaster recovery plans. Hence design of such plans is laborious, complex and depends on how big and what types of the organisations are. This task is further complicated due to dependencies that exist in different part of a plan for disaster recovery. This research study proposes Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) for analysis of a disaster recovery plan that can be of assistance to Chief Information Officers for risk analysis. Furthermore to improve risk prediction in case of an IT disaster, a Fuzzy Logic (FL) system is developed to improve decision making in such cases by providing an estimate of time delay in case of IT disaster."

abstract,"Abstract Opportunistic networks are the subclass of DTN. DTN does not require an end-to-end path to forward a message. In opportunistic networks, nodes may have partial or zero knowledge about the network. Due to which, clear information about the nodes in the network becomes difficult. Opportunistic network applications are for the situations with high tolerance of long delays, high error rate etc.; Routing in such a network is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a protocol called as Fuzzy-PRoPHET which can be a novel routing protocol for opportunistic network. The best models are chosen i.e. PRoPHET and Fuzzy to design an efficient routing protocol. Fuzzy takes all values between 0 and 1, due to which collecting best nodes can become easy. Membership functions are calculated to choose next hop. Fuzzy is the best mathematical tool to represent uncertainty. Therefore, we can achieve better results and can increase throughput with minimum communication delay."

It is hence important to study the logic of defining the grammar rules. Therefore the objective of this paper is to describe the prototype of an efficient grammar checker and to design an interface to perform grammar check. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is improved as compared to the existing methods."

abstract,"Abstract This paper considers a hotel supply chain consisting of a hotel and an online travel agent (OTA) for the distribution of a limited number of rooms through both offline and online channels. Under the merchant cooperation assumption, to overcome the disadvantages of the decentralized decision model and demand uncertainty, two collaboration mechanisms, namely a two-stage ordering contract and an option contract, are introduced to increase the profit in the hotel supply chain. This paper investigates the optimal decisions of the hotel and the OTA under different contract models. Moreover, the authors analyze the effect of demand uncertainty and the interaction of demand variability and the hotel’s capacity on the profits of the hotel and the OTA under different models. The results show that both the two-stage ordering contract and the option contract can increase the profits of the entire supply chain and the hotel; however, the profit of the OTA can be increased through the two-stage ordering contract and option contract only when the hotel’s capacity is relatively small and the demand variability is big; otherwise, the two collaboration mechanisms cannot increase the OTA’s profit."

abstract,"Abstract Systems that exhibit complex behaviours are often found in a particular dynamical condition, poised between order and disorder. This observation is at the core of the so-called criticality hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamical regime between order and disorder attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cellular and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have revitalised the interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasising its role as a viable candidate general law in adaptive complex systems. This paper provides an overview of the works on dynamical criticality that are — To the best of our knowledge — Particularly relevant for the criticality hypothesis. The authors review the main contributions concerning dynamics and information processing at the edge of chaos, and illustrate the main achievements in the study of critical dynamics in biological systems. Finally, the authors discuss open questions and propose an agenda for future work."

abstract,"Abstract This paper proposes a novel method of magnetically guided assembly to construct multi-layer porous scaffold for three-dimensional cell culture by apply magnetic microfibers. Microfibers are composed of biocompatible and biodegradable alginate solution with homogeneous magnetic nanoparticles, which are continuously spun from a microfluidic device by precise pressure control of the syringe pump. Magnetic nanoparticles enable the control of magnetic field on microfibers. Meanwhile, magnetized device combining with a round permanent magnet are utilized to guide the distribution of spouted microfibers. The device is composed by pure iron wire arrays and wax, which stimulates powerful magnetic flux density and magnetic field gradients for the capture and assembly of microfibers. Thus, magnetic microfibers are spun on desired places of the magnetized device by motion control of the micromanipulation robot, and precise locations are adjusted by magnetic force couple with the assist of glass micropipette. Afterwards, microfibers are spatially organized by periodic magnetic force and crossed layer-by-layer to form micro-pore structure with both length and width of 650 μm. Finally, the authors construct a multilayer microfiber-based scaffold with high porosity to provide a satisfactory environment for long-term cell culture. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

abstract,"Abstract This paper explores the investors’ feedback to the price change by modelling the price-related dynamics of trading intensity. A component decomposition duration modeling approach, called the component autoregressive conditional duration (CACD) model, is proposed to capture the variation of trading intensity across time intervals between price change events. Based on the CACD model, an empirical analysis is carried out on the Chinese stock market that covers different market statuses. The empirical results suggest that the CACD model can capture the price-related dynamics of trading intensity, which supports the existence of the feedback effect and is robust across different market statuses. The authors also study how the investors react to the price change by examining the driven factors of the price-related dynamics of trading intensity. The authors find that the trading can be triggered by the fast rise in the price level and the high trading volume. Besides, investors are more sensitive to the price change direction in the sideways market than in the upward or downward markets."

abstract,"Abstract In classical Markowitz’s Mean-Variance model, parameters such as the mean and covariance of the underlying assets’ future return are assumed to be known exactly. However, this is not always the case. The parameters often correspond to quantities that fall within a range, or can be known ambiguously at the time when investment decision must be made. In such situations, investors determine returns on investment and risks etc. and make portfolio decisions based on experience and economic wisdom. This paper tries to use the concept of interval numbers in the fuzzy set theory to extend the classical mean-variance portfolio selection model to a mean-downside semi-variance model with consideration of liquidity requirements of a bank. The semi-variance constraint is employed to control the downside risk, filling in the existing interval portfolio optimization model based on the linear semi-absolute deviation to depict the downside risk. Simulation results show that the model behaves robustly for risky assets with highest or lowest mean historical rate of return and the optimal investment proportions have good stability. This suggests that for these kinds of assets the model can reduce the risk of high deviation caused by the deviation in the decision maker’s experience and economic wisdom."

However, a significant reduction of this multimodel is subject to an optimal choice of Laguerre poles characterizing each local linear model ARX-Laguerre. Therefore, the authors propose an optimization algorithm to estimate, from input/output measurements, the optimal values of Laguerre poles. The ARX-Laguerre multimodel as well as the proposed optimization algorithm are tested on a continuous stirred tank reactor system (CSTR). Moreover, the authors take into account a practical validation on an experimental communicating two tank system (CTTS)."

abstract,"Abstract Understanding the characteristics of the dynamic relationship between the onshore Renminbi (CNY) and the offshore Renminbi (CNH) exchange rates considering the impact of some extreme events is very important and it has wide implications in several areas such as hedging. For better estimating the dynamic relationship between CNY and CNH, the Granger-causality test and Bry-Boschan Business Cycle Dating Algorithm were employed in this paper. Due to the intrinsic complexity of the lead-lag relationships between CNY and CNH, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm is used to decompose those time series data into several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and a residual sequence, from high to low frequency. Based on the frequencies, the IMFs and a residual sequence are combined into three components, identified as short-term composition caused by some market activities, medium-term composition caused by some extreme events and the long-term trend. The empirical results indicate that when it only matters the short-term market activities, CNH always leads CNY; while the medium-term impact caused by those extreme events may alternate the lead-lag relationships between CNY and CNH."

Thus, it is desirable to select a good blocked design before running the experiment. Mostly, a single block variable was used in the literature to treat the inhomogeneity for simplicity. However, in practice, the inhomogeneity often comes from multi block variables. Recently, a new criterion called B2-GMC was proposed for two-level regular designs with multi block variables. This paper proposes a systematic theory on constructing some B2-GMC designs for the first time. Experimenters can easily obtain the B2-GMC designs according to the construction method. Pros of B2-GMC designs are highlighted in Section 4, and the designs with small run sizes are tabulated in Appendix B for practical use."

The propensity score is specified by a semiparametric exponential tilting model. To estimate the tilting parameter in the propensity score, the authors propose an adjusted empirical likelihood method to deal with the over-identified system. Under some regular conditions, the authors investigate the asymptotic properties of the proposed three estimators for distribution functions and quantiles, and find that these estimators have the same asymptotic variance. The jackknife method is employed to consistently estimate the asymptotic variances. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed methodologies."

Model uncertainty and variable selection in the structural equation is an important issue as described in Andrews and Lu (2001) and Caner (2009). The authors propose an adaptive Lasso 2SLS estimator for linear structural equation with endogeneity and show that it enjoys the oracle properties, i.e., the consistency in both estimation and model selection. In Monte Carlo simulations, the authors demonstrate that the proposed estimator has smaller bias and MSE compared with the bridge-type GMM estimator (Caner, 2009). In a case study, the authors revisit the classic returns to education problem (Angrist and Krueger, 1991) using the China Population census data. The authors find that the education level not only has strong effects on income but also shows heterogeneity in different age cohorts."

In the time-variant consensus tracking problem, a leader agent is expected to track a desired reference input, simultaneously, follower agents are expected to maintain a time-variant formation. To solve the time-variant consensus tracking problem of planar multi-agent systems with non-holonomic constraints, a time-variant consensus tracking control strategy is designed on the basis of an unidirectional topology structure. One of main contributions of this paper is the time-variant consensus tracking protocol for general time-variant formations of planar multi-agent systems with non-holonomic constraints, the other main contribution of this paper is an active predictive control strategy, where predictions of agents are generated actively, so that the computational efficiency is improved than passive approaches. The proposed control strategy is verified by two types of time-varying formations of wheeled mobile robots, and the experimental results show that the proposed control strategy is effective for general time-variant consensus tracking problems of planar multi-agent systems with non-holonomic constraints in local and worldwide networked environments."

In such a graph paths are compared by their total weight in each colour, resulting in a Pareto set of minimal paths from one vertex to another. This paper will give a tight upper bound on the cardinality of a minimal set of paths for any weighted edge-coloured graph. Additionally, a bound is presented on the expected number of minimal paths in weighted edge–bicoloured graphs. These bounds indicate that despite weighted edge-coloured graphs are theoretically intractable, amenability to computation is typically found in practice."

abstract,"Abstract This paper gives an equivalent condition for the observability of Boolean control networks (BCNs) with time-variant delays in states under a mild assumption by using the graph-theoretic method under the framework of the semi-tensor product of matrices. First, the BCN under consideration is split into a finite number of subsystems with no time delays. Second, the observability of the BCN is verified by testing the observability of the so-called observability constructed path (a special subsystem without time delays) based on graph theory. These results extend the recent related results on the observability of BCNs. Examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the results."

abstract,"Abstract Monitoring the operational state of sensors promptly and the accurate diagnosis of faults are essential. This paper proposes an improved fault diagnosis scheme for sensors, which includes both fault detection and fault identification. Firstly, trend analysis combined with least squares support vector machine (TA-LSSVM) method is proposed and implemented to detect faults. Secondly, an improved error correcting output coding-support vector machine (ECOC-SVM) based fault identification method is proposed to distinguish different sensor failure modes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, experiments are conducted with an MTi-series sensor, and some comparisons are made with other fault identification methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fault diagnosis scheme offers an essential improvement with detection real-time property and better identification accuracy."

A statutory authority and the public hospitals under its governance are interpreted as a team, the members of which seek to operate efficiently under the shared institutional constraint that public healthcare is a public good. The individual public hospital exploits DEA to maximize own-payoff, subject to the team-condition that the payoff of each other public hospital does not fall and thereby subtract from the external effects created by the public supply of healthcare. The resulting team-DEA solution, which is shown to be both an individually-efficient and team-satisficing equilibrium and to be computable in terms of a convergent algorithm, can then be applied by the authority to determine the optimal allocation of resources in public healthcare. A case based on Chinese data is presented to illustrate the team-DEA model’s ready operationalization and computation."

abstract,"Abstract The problem of computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of multivariate polynomials, as one of the most important tasks of computer algebra and symbolic computation in more general scope, has been studied extensively since the beginning of the interdisciplinary of mathematics with computer science. For many real applications such as digital image restoration and enhancement, robust control theory of nonlinear systems, L1-norm convex optimization in compressed sensing techniques, as well as algebraic decoding of Reed-Solomon and BCH codes, the concept of sparse GCD plays a core role where only the greatest common divisors with much fewer terms than the original polynomials are of interest due to the nature of problems or data structures. This paper presents two methods via multivariate polynomial interpolation which are based on the variation of Zippel’s method and Ben-Or/Tiwari algorithm, respectively. To reduce computational complexity, probabilistic techniques and randomization are employed to deal with univariate GCD computation and univariate polynomial interpolation. The authors demonstrate the practical performance of our algorithms on a significant body of examples. The implemented experiment illustrates that our algorithms are efficient for a quite wide range of input."

However, it remains to be a challenging problem since Gröbner basis theory is not yet powerful enough to deal with ideals that cannot be finitely generated. This paper solves the problem by extending Gröbner basis theory. First, the polynomials are described via an infinitely generated free commutative monoid ring. The authors then provide a decomposed form of the Gröbner basis of the defining syzygy set in each restricted ring. The canonical form proves to be the normal form with respect to the Gröbner basis in the fundamental restricted ring, which allows one to determine the equivalence of polynomials. Finally, in order to simplify the computation of canonical form, the authors find the minimal restricted ring."

An interval type-2 T-S fuzzy model is used to represent the nonlinear systems subject to parameter uncertainties. An interval type-2 fuzzy static output feedback controller is designed to synthesize the interval type-2 T-S fuzzy systems. The membership-function-dependent stability conditions are derived by utilizing the information of upper and lower membership functions. The proposed stability conditions are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). LMI-based stability conditions for interval type-2 fuzzy static output feedback H∞ control synthesis are also developed. Several simulation examples are given to show the superiority of the proposed approach.

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, an HIV dynamics model with two distributed intracellular delays incorporating Crowley-Martin functional response infection rate is investigated. The authors take into account multiple stage disease transmission and the latently infected cells (not yet producing virus) in our system. The authors consider nonnegativity, boundedness of solutions, and global asymptotic stability of the system. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals and using the Lyapunov-LaSalle invariance principle, the authors prove the global stability of the infected (endemic) equilibrium and the diseasefree equilibrium for time delays. The authors have proven that if the basic reproduction number R0 is less than unity, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and if R0 is greater than unity, then the infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. The results obtained show that the global dynamic behaviors of the model are completely determined by the basic reproduction number R0 and that the time delay does not affect the global asymptotic properties of the model."

Meanwhile, it is full of opportunities and challenges that appeal to numerous securities traders and investors with the rapid development momentum. Since its establishment, the NTB Market has been stuck in the lack of liquidity. The authority of the NTB Market introduced market maker system, so as to solve the problem of liquidity. Using the difference-in-difference method (DID method), the market maker system has been proved to make little contribution to improving the stock liquidity. Although the problem of liquidity is difficult to solve in short term, the NTB Market is full of opportunities for all kinds of participants definitely."

The aim of this paper is to design an FD filter such that the FD dynamics is exponentially stable in the mean square and, at the same time, the error between the residual signal and the fault signal is made as small as possible. Intensive analysis is utilized to derive the sufficient conditions for the designed FD filter, which guarantees the exponential stability and the prescribed H∞ performance. FD filter parameters are obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FD design scheme."

abstract,"Abstract This paper studies an M/M/1 queueing-inventory system with batch demands. Customers arrive in the system according to a compound Poisson process, where the size of the batch demands for each arrival is a random variable that follows a geometric distribution. The inventory is replenished according to the standard (s,S) policy. The replenishment time follows an exponential distribution. Two models are considered. In the first model, if the on-hand inventory is less than the size of the batch demands of an arrived customer, the customer takes away all the items in the inventory, and a part of the customer’s batch demands is lost. In the second model, if the on-hand inventory is less than the size of the batch demands of an arrived customer, the customer leaves without taking any item from the inventory, and all of the customer’s batch demands are lost. For these two models, the authors derive the stationary conditions of the system. Then, the authors derive the stationary distributions of the product-form of the joint queue length and the on-hand inventory process. Besides this, the authors obtain some important performance measures and the average cost functions by using these stationary distributions. The results are illustrated by numerical examples."

abstract,"Abstract In order to avoid the overcharge and overdischarge damages, and to improve the lifetime of the lithium-ion batteries, it is essential to keep the cell voltages in a battery pack at the same level, i.e., battery equalization. Based on the bi-directional modified Ćuk converter, variable universe fuzzy controllers are proposed to adaptively maintain equalizing currents between cells of a serially connected battery pack in varying conditions. The inputs to the fuzzy controller are the voltage differences and the average voltages of adjacent cell pairs. A large voltage difference requires large equalizing current while adjacent cells both with low/high voltages can only stand small discharge/charge currents. Compared with the conventional fuzzy control method, the proposed method differs in that the universe can shrink or expand as the effects of the input changes. This is important as the input may change in a small range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed variable universe fuzzy control method has fast equalization speed and good adaptiveness for varying conditions."

abstract,"Abstract In recent years, networked distributed control systems (NDCS) have received research attention. Two of the main challenges that such systems face are possible delays in the communication network and the effect of strong interconnections between agents. This paper considers an NDCS that has delays in the communication network, as well as strong interconnections between its agents. The control objective is to make each agent track efficiently a reference model by attenuating the effect of strong interconnections via feedback based on the delayed information. First, the authors assume that each agent knows its own dynamics, as well as the interconnection parameters, but receives information about the states of its neighbors with some communication delay. The authors propose a distributed control scheme and prove that if the interconnections can be weakened and if the communication delays are small enough, then the proposed scheme guarantees that the tracking error of each agent is bounded with a bound that depends on the size of the weakened interconnections and delays, and reduces to zero as these uncertainties reduce to zero. The authors then consider a more realistic situation where the interconnections between agents are unknown despite the cooperation and sharing of state information. For this case the authors propose a distributed adaptive control scheme and prove that the proposed scheme guarantees that the tracking errors are bounded and small in the mean square sense with respect to the size of the weakened interconnections and delays, provided the weakened interconnections and time delays are small enough. The authors then consider the case that each agent knows neither its dynamics nor the interconnection matrices. For this case the authors propose a distributed adaptive control scheme and prove that the proposed scheme guarantees that the tracking errors are bounded and small in the mean square sense provided the weakened interconnections and time delays are small enough. Finally, the authors present an illustrative example to present the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed schemes."

abstract,"Abstract This paper proposes a solution for the problem of cooperative salvo attack of multiple cruise missiles against targets in a group. Synchronization of the arrival time of missiles to hit their common target, minimizing the time consumption of attack and maximizing the expected damage to group targets are taken into consideration simultaneously. These operational objectives result in a hierarchical mixed-variable optimization problem which includes two types of subproblems, namely the multi-objective missile-target assignment (MOMTA) problem at the upper level and the time-optimal coordinated path planning (TOCPP) problems at the lower level. In order to solve the challenging problem, a recently proposed coordinated path planning method is employed to solve the TOCPP problems to achieve the soonest salvo attack against each target. With the aim of finding a more competent solver for MOMTA, three state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization methods (MOMs), namely NSGA-II, MOEA/D and DMOEA-εC, are adopted. Finally, a typical example is used to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. A simple rule-based method is also employed for comparison. Comparative results show that DMOEA-εC is the best choice among the three MOMs for solving the MOMTA problem. The combination of DMOEA-εC for MOMTA and the coordinated path planning method for TOCPP can generate obviously better salvo attack schemes than the rule-based method."

This paper will show that a 3-dimensional manifold can be constructed based on the information about the Lipschitz constants of the system nonlinear dynamics, such that whenever the three parameters of each PID controller are chosen from the manifold, the whole multi-agent system can be stabilized globally and the tracking error of each agent approaches to zero asymptotically.

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, a curved path following control algorithm for miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in winds with constant speed and altitude is developed. Different to the widely considered line or orbit following, the curved path to be followed is defined in terms of the arc-length parameter, which can be straight lines, orbits, B-splines or any other curves provided that they are smooth. The proposed path following control algorithm, named by VF-SMC, is combining the vector field (VF) strategy with the sliding mode control (SMC) method. It is proven that the designed algorithm guarantees the tracking errors to be a bounded ball in the presence of winds, with the aid of the Lyapunov method and the BIBO stability. The algorithm is validated both in Matlab-based simulations and high-fidelity semi-physical simulations. In Matlab-based simulations, the proposed algorithm is verified for straight lines, orbits and B-splines to show its wide usage in different curves. The high-fidelity semi-physical simulation system is composed of actual autopilot controller, ground station and X-Plane flight simulator in-loop. In semi-physical simulations, the proposed algorithm is verified for B-spline path following under various gain parameters and wind conditions thoroughly. All experiments show the accuracy in curved path following and the excellent robustness to wind disturbances of the proposed algorithm."

Specifically, whether the control signal is lost can be acknowledged by the receiver in the NCSs. The main contributions are: 1) For the finite horizon case, the “optimal” output feedback control is derived by using the dynamic programming approach, and it is noted that the separation principle holds for the considered situation; 2) For the infinite horizon case, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient stabilization conditions are derived for NCSs with packet dropout and delay."

Based on some relatively simple threshold constants, three levels of event conditions are set and thus the ETIC scheme is designed. Three cases for ETIC with and without time-delays and data dropouts are studied respectively, and the criteria on exponential stability are derived for the controlled DDS. The stabilization in the form of exponential stability is achieved for DDS under the designed ETIC with or without time-delays. And in the case of the ETIC data dropouts, the conditions of exponential stabilization are derived for DDS and the maximal allowable dropout rates for ETIC are estimated. Finally, one example with numerical simulations is worked out for illustration."

The disturbances are assumed to be sinusoidal with completely unknown frequencies, phases and amplitudes. First, as an extension of the classic concept of internal model for non-switched systems, a switched internal model is proposed. Second, in order to solve the problem under study, an adaptive control method is established on the basis of the multiple Lyapunov functions method. Also, adaptive state-feedback controllers of subsystems are designed and incorporated with a switching law to asymptotically reject the unknown disturbances. Finally, an example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method."

Adaptive control method is introduced to estimate the upper bound of the target’s acceleration. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance laws is verified both theoretically and numerically."

The dynamics of follower agents are also affected by the input additive disturbances. Low-and-high gain feedback consensus protocols are constructed to solve these problems. More specifically, it is shown that robust semi-global leaderless consensus can be achieved over a connected undirected graph and robust semi-global containment control can be achieved when each follower agent has access to the information of at least one leader agent.

abstract,"Abstract This paper studies a distributed robust resource allocation problem with nonsmooth objective functions under polyhedral uncertain allocation parameters. In the considered distributed robust resource allocation problem, the (nonsmooth) objective function is a sum of local convex objective functions assigned to agents in a multi-agent network. Each agent has a private feasible set and decides a local variable, and all the local variables are coupled with a global affine inequality constraint, which is subject to polyhedral uncertain parameters. With the duality theory of convex optimization, the authors derive a robust counterpart of the robust resource allocation problem. Based on the robust counterpart, the authors propose a novel distributed continuous-time algorithm, in which each agent only knows its local objective function, local uncertainty parameter, local constraint set, and its neighbors’ information. Using the stability theory of differential inclusions, the authors show that the algorithm is able to find the optimal solution under some mild conditions. Finally, the authors give an example to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

To synchronize the outputs, a leader is introduced whose connectivity to the followers varies with time, and a novel data-driven consensus protocol based on model free adaptive control is proposed, where the reference input of each follower is designed to be the time-varying average of the neighboring agents’ outputs. Both the case when the leader is with a prescribed reference input and the case otherwise are considered. The proposed protocol allows for time-varying delays, switching topology, and does not use the agent structure or the dynamics information implicitly or explicitly. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the closed-loop stability, and conditions for consensus convergence are obtained, where only a joint spanning tree is required. Numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol."

abstract,"Abstract This paper addresses a channel scheduling problem for group of dynamically decoupled nonlinear subsystems with actuators connected through digital communication channels and controlled by a centralized controller. Due to the limited communication capacity, only one channel can be activated and hence there is only one pair of sensor and actuator can communicate with the controller at each time instant. In addition, the communication channels are not reliable so Markovian packed dropout is introduced. A predictive control framework is adopted for controller/scheduler co-design to alleviate the performance loss caused by the limited communication capacity. Instead of sending a single control value, the controller sends a sequence of predicted control values to a selected actuator so that there are control input candidates which can be fed to the subsystem when the actuator does not communicate with the controller. A stochastic algorithm is proposed to schedule the usage of the communication medium and sufficient conditions on stochastic stability are given under some mild assumptions."

This transformation reduces the computing complexity such that the Pareto frontier of the switched LQ differential game can be constructed by dynamic programming.

The authors obtain a lower bound on the nonlinearity of the Tang-Carlet-Tang functions, which is slightly better than the known result. If the authors do not break the “continuity” of the support and zero sets, the functions constructed in this paper have suboptimal algebraic immunity. Finally, four specific classes of 1-resilient Boolean functions constructed from this construction and with the mentioned good cryptographic properties are proposed. Experimental results show that there are many 1-resilient Boolean functions have higher nonlinearities than known 1-resilient functions modified by Tu-Deng and Tang-Carlet-Tang functions."

abstract,"Abstract This paper considers an infinite buffer renewal input queue with multiple working vacation policy wherein customers are served by a single server according to general bulk service (a, b)-rule (1 ≤ a ≤ b). If the number of waiting customers in the system at a service completion epoch (during a normal busy period) is lower than ‘a’, then the server starts a vacation. During a vacation if the number of waiting customers reaches the minimum threshold size ‘a’, then the server starts serving this batch with a lower rate than that of the normal busy period. After completion of a batch service during working vacation, if the server finds less than ‘a’ customers accumulated in the system, then the server takes another vacation, otherwise the server continues to serve the available batch with that lower rate. The maximum allowed size of a batch in service is ‘b’. The authors derive both queue-length and system-length distributions at pre-arrival epoch using both embedded Markov chain approach and the roots method. The arbitrary epoch probabilities are obtained using the classical argument based on renewal theory. Several performance measures like average queue and system-length, mean waiting-time, cost and profit optimization are studied and numerically computed."

This model can finish the modeling process in self-organized manner, including finding the optimal complexity model, determining the optimal auto-regressive order and estimating model parameters. Further, four different external criteria are proposed and the corresponding four GAR models are constructed. The authors conduct empirical analysis on three energy consumption time series, including the total energy consumption, the total petroleum consumption and the total gas consumption. The results show that AS-GAR model has the best forecasting performance among the four GAR models, and it outperforms ARIMA model, BP neural network model, support vector regression model and GM (1, 1) model.

The authors also obtain the explicit expression of the probability generating function for the expected number of departures occurring in the time interval (0+, n+] from any initial state. Meanwhile, the relationship among departure process, server’s state process and service renewal process in server busy period is found, which shows the special structure of departure process. Especially, some corresponding results of departure process for special discrete-time queues are directly gained by our results. Furthermore, the approximate expansion for calculating the expected number of departures is presented. In addition, some other important performance measures, including the expected length of server busy period, server’s actual vacation period and busy cycle period etc., are analyzed.

On the assumption that the interconnected functions of the systems satisfied the global Lipschitz condition, by using vector Lyapunov methods and M-matrix theory, the integrodifferential inequalities with unbounded delay were constructed. By the stability analysis of the integrodifferential inequalities, the sufficient conditions to ensure the robust exponential stability of the interval interconnected systems were obtained. By using average dwell time approach, conditions for guaranteeing the robust exponential stability of the switched delay interval interconnected systems were derived. Finally, two numerical examples were given to illustrate the correction and effectiveness of the proposed theory."

abstract,"Abstract Stock index forecasting has been one of the most widely investigated topics in the field of financial forecasting. Related studies typically advocate for tuning the parameters of forecasting models by minimizing learning errors measured using statistical metrics such as the mean squared error or mean absolute percentage error. The authors argue that statistical metrics used to guide parameter tuning of forecasting models may not be meaningful, given the fact that the ultimate goal of forecasting is to facilitate investment decisions with expected profits in the future. The authors therefore introduce the Sharpe ratio into the process of model building and take it as the profit metric to guide parameter tuning rather than using the commonly adopted statistical metrics. The authors consider three widely used trading strategies, which include a na¨ıve strategy, a filter strategy and a dual moving average strategy, as investment scenarios. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed profit guided approach, the authors carry out simulation experiments using three global mainstream stock market indices. The results show that profit guided forecasting models are competitive, and in many cases produce significantly better performances than statistical error guided models. This implies that profit guided stock index forecasting is a worthwhile alternative over traditional stock index forecasting practices."

abstract,"Abstract This paper suggests an extending conventional gravity model design to empirically analyze the effect of transport costs and port efficiency on China’s export flows. It shows that factor endowment and transport costs variables affect export trade value in directions that New Trade Theory (NTT) predicted. Also, the evidence indicates that, controlling for the effects of transport costs on trade, variables in traditional gravity model are consistent with previous empirical studies in both magnitudes and directions. Moreover, more than 22% of the variation in Chinese export trade can be explained by those three variables alone. The findings reported in this paper empirically explains how seriously transport costs and port efficiency affect China’s export growth by comparing effects of labour production factor costs on external trade. It suggests that the improvement of port efficiency and reduction of road transport costs play a vital role in China’s export competitiveness in the global market."

abstract,"Abstract An acquisition discount can reflect not only the liquidity demands for unlisted targets but also the strategic requirements, management efficiencies and capital allocations for the listed bidders. Based on Officer (2007), the authors choose an acquisition approach to generate an acquisition discount for unlisted targets. In China, unlisted firms are sold at a deeper discount than listed firms. The deeper discount mainly depends on the liquidity demand and the characteristics of the bilateral trading components. Larger bidders tend to pay more, whereas smaller targets are sold at lower discounts. The values of unlisted targets in the TMT industry are underestimated. Furthermore, buying out unlisted targets can significantly increase the abnormal return of public bidders during the announcement period. Deeper discounts or stock payments have a positive effect on the stock values of the bidders, whereas this positive increase will be weakened if the bidder is large or has a previous ownership relationship."

The measure of informed trading can capture some asymmetric information properties, which is consistent with some empirical consensuses. Furthermore, compared with the MLE method in EKOP model, the method has computational facilities in avoiding the overflow or underflow problem, the boundary solutions problem and the initial values problem. And the method could be applied to the high-frequency world in both order-driven and quote-driven market."

Without the random noise, the model predicts that the truth can only be captured by the truth seekers who own actively perceptive ability of the truth and their believers, while the other individuals may stick to falsehood. But under the influence of the random noise, the authors strictly prove that even there is only one truth seeker in the group, all individuals will finally approach the truth."

Different from the known controllability results in the case that a control acts on the degenerate boundary, any initial value in state space is controllable in this case. Also, an explicit expression for the controllability time is given. Furthermore, a counterexample on the controllability is given for some other degenerate wave equations."

abstract,"Abstract Joint loan guarantee contracts and mutual guarantee contracts among SMEs form the basis of SME guarantee networks. The expansion of these networks increases the fragility of a financial system as a result of the regional and industrial risk contagion embedded within them. By providing a theoretical framework of a loan guarantee network, a method is proposed for calculating the amount of risk spillover caused by loan guarantees taking the perspective of the entire network. In addition, the route of risk contagion in guarantee networks is analyzed, revealing that when default risk shocks occur, risk contagion travels along the nodes not once but for several rounds and that the risk control of one firm cannot prevent these systemic risks. Therefore, a risk control scheme is designed based on the location and importance of firms in the network. Using data from a real guarantee network, we demonstrate that identifying the node locations of firms’ in the guarantee network (including the coritivity and closeness of the firm) can help in understanding risk contagion mechanisms and preventing systemic credit risk before a crisis occurs."

Under broad conditions, it is shown that a scaled sequence of the empirical measure converges weakly to a number of Brownian bridges modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain.

In the partially linear model, the authors first estimate the unknown nonlinear component by some nonparametric methods and then generalize the F-statistic to test the regression coefficients under some regular conditions. During this procedure, the estimation of the nonlinear component brings much challenge to explore the properties of generalized F-test. The authors obtain some asymptotic properties of the generalized F-test in more general cases, including the asymptotic normality and the power of this test with p/n ∈ (0, 1) without normality assumption. The asymptotic result is general and by adding some constraint conditions we can obtain the similar conclusions in high dimensional linear models. Through simulation studies, the authors demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the proposed test in comparison with the theoretical results. The practical utility of our method is illustrated by a real data example."

Much prior research has developed clinical process models that consider the trajectory of services occurring in a care process, by using data mining techniques on process execution logs. A novel approach that provides a more efficient way of clinical pathway design is introduced in this paper. Based on the strategy of TEI@I methodology, the proposed approach integrates statistical methods, optimization techniques and data mining. With the preprocessed data, a complex care process is subsequently divided into several medical stages, and then the patterns of each stage are identified, and thus a clinical pathway is developed. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the real world, using archival data derived from a hospital in Beijing, about three diseases that involve various departments, with an average of 300 samples for each disease. The results of realworld applications demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically and efficiently facilitate clinical pathways design. The main contributions to the field in this paper include (a) a new application of TEI@I methodology in healthcare domain, (b) a novel method for complex processes analysis, (c) tangible evidence of automatic clinical pathways design in the real world."

abstract,"Abstract Estimating the number of isolated roots of a polynomial system is not only a fundamental study theme in algebraic geometry but also an important subproblem of homotopy methods for solving polynomial systems. For the mixed trigonometric polynomial systems, which are more general than polynomial systems and rather frequently occur in many applications, the classical Bézout number and the multihomogeneous Bézout number are the best known upper bounds on the number of isolated roots. However, for the deficient mixed trigonometric polynomial systems, these two upper bounds are far greater than the actual number of isolated roots. The BKK bound is known as the most accurate upper bound on the number of isolated roots of a polynomial system. However, the extension of the definition of the BKK bound allowing it to treat mixed trigonometric polynomial systems is very difficult due to the existence of sine and cosine functions. In this paper, two new upper bounds on the number of isolated roots of a mixed trigonometric polynomial system are defined and the corresponding efficient algorithms for calculating them are presented. Numerical tests are also given to show the accuracy of these two definitions, and numerically prove they can provide tighter upper bounds on the number of isolated roots of a mixed trigonometric polynomial system than the existing upper bounds, and also the authors compare the computational time for calculating these two upper bounds."

Then, the authors design a control strategy to ensure that individuals aggregate at a point in the ROI relying on their local perceptions and the locations of neighbors within their communication scope. The authors describe this situation of aggregation as rendezvous. In addition, the authors introduce artificial potential field to make sensors deploy dispersedly in a bounded range near the ROI, which the authors call dispersed deployment. Finally, the authors prove the stability of the proposed strategies and validate the theoretical results by simulations.

abstract,"Abstract Generalized B-splines have been employed as geometric modeling and numerical simulation tools for isogeometric analysis (IGA for short). However, the previous models used in IGA, such as trigonometric generalized B-splines or hyperbolic generalized B-splines, are not the unified mathematical representation of conics and polynomial parametric curves/surfaces. In this paper, a unified approach to construct the generalized non-uniform B-splines over the space spanned by {α(t), β(t), ξ(t), η(t), 1, t, · · ·, t  n–4} is proposed, and the corresponding isogeometric analysis framework for PDE solving is also studied. Compared with the NURBS-IGA method, the proposed frameworks have several advantages such as high accuracy, easy-to-compute derivatives and integrals due to the non-rational form. Furthermore, with the proposed spline models, isogeometric analysis can be performed on the computational domain bounded by transcendental curves/surfaces, such as the involute of circle, the helix/helicoid, the catenary/catenoid and the cycloid. Several numerical examples for isogeometric heat conduction problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

When the supplier considers distributional fairness of loss aversion and extra-gain guilty, extra-gain guilty concern reduces the optimal wholesale and retail price, and improves supply chain performance. When the first or the second retailer considers distributional fairness and peer-induced fairness, extra-gain guilty concerns decrease the optimal wholesale and retail price but increase the profit of all supply chain members only when the level of loss aversion is large enough and the level of extra-gain guilty is less than 1/2. However, when the level of loss aversion is small and the level of extra-gain guilty is less than 1/2, extra-gain guilty has no influence on supply chain performance. The analysis reveals that the supply chain performance can be further improved by considering fairness of extra-gain guilty."

abstract,"Abstract This paper considers a single server retrial queue in which a state-dependent service policy is adopted to control the service rate. Customers arrive in the system according to a Poisson process and the service times and inter-retrial times are all exponentially distributed. If the number of customers in orbit is equal to or less than a certain threshold, the service rate is set in a low value and it also can be switched to a high value once this number exceeds the threshold. The stationary distribution and two performance measures are obtained through the partial generating functions. It is shown that this state-dependent service policy degenerates into a classic retrial queueing system without control policy under some conditions. In order to achieve the social optimal strategies, a new reward-cost function is established and the global numerical solutions, obtained by Canonical Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, demonstrate that the managers can get more benefits if applying this state-dependent service policy compared with the classic model."

A practically feasible algorithm to calculate the numerical solution of the optimal feedback control by dynamic programming approach is developed. The highlights of this algorithm are: a) It is based on a convergent constructive algorithm for optimal feedback control law which was proposed by the authors before through an approximation for the viscosity solution of the time-space discretization scheme developed by dynamic programming method; b) The computation complexity is significantly reduced since only values of viscosity solution on some local cones around the optimal trajectory are calculated. Two numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and fastness of the algorithm.

The authors transform TCTP into a simple activity float problem and design a complex polynomial algorithm for its solution. First, the authors discover relationships between activity floats and path lengths by studying activity floats from the perspective of path instead of time. Second, the authors perform simplification and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the solution by deleting redundant activities and narrowing the duration intervals of non-redundant activities. Finally, the authors compare our method with current methods. The relationships between activity floats and path lengths provide new approaches for other path and correlative project problems."

During solving the identification problem, the improved security protocol can ensure that the input information is not leaked, and thus, can deal with passive attacks effectively. Besides, a quantitative relationship among the input information, the public key in encryption and the number of participants in the improved protocol is shown. Finally, the simulation results show that, the identification algorithm can still achieve the estimation accuracy by adding the improved security protocol. However, compared with the original identification algorithm, the time complexity of the algorithm with the improved security protocol increases."

The language is based on the theory of schema mappings, in particular those defined by a specific class of tgds, which we actually use to optimize user programs and facilitate the translation towards several target systems. The characteristics of such class guarantee good tractability properties and the applicability in Big Data settings.

abstract,"Abstract The Cloud workflow scheduling is to find proper Cloud resources for the execution of workflow tasks to efficiently utilize resources and meet different user’s quality of service requirements. Cloud workflow scheduling is a constrained and NP-complete problem and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have shown their excellent ability to solve such problem. But most existing works simply use static penalty function to handle constraints which usually result in premature when the constraints become strict. On the other hand, with the search space being more tremendous and chaotic, how to balance the ability of exploring the entire search space and exploiting the important regions during the evolutionary process is increasingly important. In this paper, an adaptive individual-assessment scheme based on evolutionary states is proposed to handle the constraints in multi-objective optimization problems. In addition, the evolutionary parameters are also adjusted accordingly to balance the exploration and exploitation ability. These are distinguishable from most previous studies that directly incorporate multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to search excellent solutions for Cloud workflow scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in convergence and diversity, and it also achieves better optimization ability when it is applied to solve Cloud workflow scheduling problem."

abstract,"Abstract One of the organizations’ main concerns is to protect sensitive data in database systems, especially the ones outsourced to untrusted service providers. An effective solution for this issue is to employ database encryption methods. Among different encryption approaches, Bucket-based method has the advantage of balancing security and performance of database operations. However, generating false-positive results in executing queries is the main drawback of this method. On the other hand, multi-join queries are one of the most critical operations executed on these stored sensitive data. Hence, acceptable processing and response time in executing multi-join queries is required. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ant-colony algorithm (named BACO) which aims to reduce the required processing efforts in multi-join query optimization problem alongside with reducing the total false-positive results generated in Bucket-based encrypted databases. Our enhanced solution approach leads to much less response time without losing solutions’ quality. Experimental results denote that our proposed solution can yield 75% decrease in multi-join queries processing efforts and 74% decrease in the total amount of false-positive results in a faster manner and with better performance than previous methods."

The combination of GPU and cluster-based parallel computing techniques is investigated for the purpose of accelerating the process of extracting the correlations between items in sizeable data instances. We propose four parallel-based approaches that benefit from the cluster intensive computing in the generation process and the massively GPU threading. This is by evaluating the association rules in parallel on GPU. To validate the proposed approaches, the most used population-based metaheuristics (GA, PSO, and BSO) have been executed on a cluster of GPUs to solve benchmarks of large and big ARM instances. We used Intel Xeon 64bit quad-core processor E5520 coupled to an Nvidia Tesla C2075 GPU device. The results show that the BSO outperforms GA and PSO. They also show that the proposed solution outperforms the HPC-based ARM approaches when exploring Webdocs instance (the largest instance existing on the web). To our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the combination of GPU and cluster-based parallel computing with the population-based metaheuristics in association rule mining."

abstract,"Abstract Efficient join processing plays an important role in big data analysis. In this work, we focus on generic theta joins in a massively parallel environment, such as MapReduce and Spark. Theta joins are notoriously slow due to their inherent quadratic complexity, even when their selectivity is low, e.g., 1%. The main performance bottleneck differs between cases, and is due to any of the following factors or their combination: amount of data being shuffled, memory load on reducers, or computation load on reducers. We propose an ensemble-based partitioning approach that tackles all three aspects. In this way, we can save communication cost, we better respect the memory and computation limitations of reducers and overall, we reduce the total execution time. The key idea behind our partitioning is to cluster join key values following two techniques, namely matrix re-arrangement and agglomerative clustering. These techniques can run either in isolation or in combination. We present thorough experimental results using both band queries on real data and arbitrary synthetic predicates. We show that we can save up to 45% of the communication cost and reduce the computation load of a single reducer up to 50% in band queries, whereas the savings are up to 74 and 80%, respectively, in queries with arbitrary theta predicates. Apart from being effective, the potential benefits of our approach can be estimated before execution from metadata, which allows for informed partitioning decisions. Finally, our solutions are flexible in that they can account for any weighted combination of the three bottleneck factors."

abstract,"Abstract Distributed skyline computation is important for a wide range of domains, from distributed and web-based systems to ISP-network monitoring and distributed databases. The problem is particularly challenging in dynamic distributed settings, where the goal is to efficiently monitor a continuous skyline query over a collection of distributed streams. All existing work relies on the assumption of a single point of reference for object attributes/dimensions: objects may be vertically or horizontally partitioned, but the accurate value of each dimension for each object is always maintained by a single site. This assumption is unrealistic for several distributed applications, where object information is fragmented over a set of distributed streams (each monitored by a different site) and needs to be aggregated (e.g., averaged) across several sites. Furthermore, it is frequently useful to define skyline dimensions through complex functions over the aggregated objects, which raises further challenges for dealing with distribution and object fragmentation. We present the first known distributed algorithms for continuous monitoring of skylines over complex functions of fragmented multi-dimensional objects. Our algorithms rely on decomposition of the skyline monitoring problem to a select set of distributed threshold-crossing queries, which can be monitored locally at each site. We propose several optimizations, including: (a) a technique for adaptively determining the most efficient monitoring strategy for each object, (b) an approximate monitoring technique, and (c) a strategy that reduces communication overhead by grouping together threshold-crossing queries. Furthermore, we discuss how our proposed algorithms can be used to address other continuous query types. A thorough experimental study with synthetic and real-life data sets verifies the effectiveness of our schemes and demonstrates order-of-magnitude improvements in communication costs compared to the only alternative centralized solution."

history,['2018-03-26']
abstract,"Abstract Association rules mining has attracted much attention among data mining topics because it has been successfully applied in various fields to find the association between purchased items by identifying frequent patterns (FPs). Currently, databases are huge, ranging in size from terabytes to petabytes. Although past studies can effectively discover FPs to deduce association rules, the execution efficiency is still a critical problem, particularly for big data. Progressive size working set (PSWS) and parallel FP-growth (PFP) are state-of-the-art methods that have been applied successfully to parallel and distributed computing technology to improve mining processing time in many-task computing, thereby bridging the gap between high-throughput and high-performance computing. However, such methods cannot mine before obtaining a complete FP-tree or the corresponding subdatabase, causing a high idle time for computing nodes. We propose a method that can begin mining when a small part of an FP-tree is received. The idle time of computing nodes can be reduced, and thus, the time required for mining can be reduced effectively. Through an empirical evaluation, the proposed method is shown to be faster than PSWS and PFP."

abstract,"Abstract Collaborative databases such as genome databases, often involve extensive curation activities where collaborators need to interact to be able to converge and agree on the content of data. In a typical scenario, a member of the collaboration makes some updates and these become visible to all collaborators for possible comments and modifications. At the same time, these updates are usually pending the approval or rejection from the data custodian based on the related discussion and the content of the data. Unfortunately, the approval and authorization of updates in current databases is based solely on the identity of the user, e.g., via the SQL GRANT and REVOKE commands. In this paper, we present a scalable cloud-based collaborative database system to support collaboration and data curation scenarios. Our system is based on an Update Pending Approval model. In a nutshell, when a collaborator updates a given data item, it is marked as pending approval until the data custodian approves or rejects the update. Until then, any other collaborator can view and comment on the data, pending its approval. We fully realized our system inside HBase, a cloud-based platform. We also conducted extensive experiments showing that the system scales well under different workloads."

abstract,"Abstract In this paper, we present MetaStore, a metadata management framework for scientific data repositories. Scientific experiments are generating a deluge of data, and the handling of associated metadata is critical, as it enables discovering, analyzing, reusing, and sharing of scientific data. Moreover, metadata produced by scientific experiments are heterogeneous and subject to frequent changes, demanding a flexible data model. Existing metadata management systems provide a broad range of features for handling scientific metadata. However, the principal limitation of these systems is their architecture design that is restricted towards either a single or at the most a few standard metadata models. Support for handling different types of metadata models, i.e., administrative, descriptive, structural, and provenance metadata, and including community-specific metadata models is not possible with these systems. To address this challenge, we present MetaStore, an adaptive metadata management framework based on a NoSQL database and an RDF triple store. MetaStore provides a set of core functionalities to handle heterogeneous metadata models by automatically generating the necessary software code (services) and on-the-fly extends the functionality of the framework. To handle dynamic metadata and to control metadata quality, MetaStore also provides an extended set of functionalities such as enabling annotation of images and text by integrating the Web Annotation Data Model, allowing communities to define discipline-specific vocabularies using Simple Knowledge Organization System, and providing advanced search and analytical capabilities by integrating the ElasticSearch. To maximize the utilization of the data models supported by NoSQL databases, MetaStore automatically segregates the different categories of metadata in their corresponding data models. Complex provenance graphs and dynamic metadata are modeled and stored in an RDF triple store, whereas the static metadata is stored in a NoSQL database. For enabling large-scale harvesting (sharing) of metadata using the METS standard over the OAI-PMH protocol, MetaStore is designed OAI-compliant. Finally, to show the practical usability of the MetaStore framework and that the requirements from the research communities have been realized, we describe our experience in the adoption of MetaStore for three communities."

We demonstrate how to integrate ontology partitioning and parallelism in the ontology matching process in order to make the statistical predictive model scalable to large ontology matching tasks.

abstract,"Abstract Data curation activities in collaborative databases mandate that collaborators interact until they converge and agree on the content of their data. In a previous work, we presented a cloud-based collaborative database system that promotes and enables collaboration and data curation scenarios. Our system classifies different versions of a data item to either pending, approved, or rejected. The approval or rejection of a certain version is done by the database Principle Investigators (or PIs) based on its value. Our system also allows collaborators to view the status of each version and help PIs take decisions by providing feedback based on their experiments and/or opinions. Most importantly, our system provided mechanisms for history tracking of different versions to trace the modifications and approval/rejection done by both collaborators and PIs on different versions of a data item. We labeled our system as Update-Pending-Approval model (or UPA). In this paper, we describe a high level SQL query interface language for PIs and collaborators to interact with the UPA framework. We define a set of UPA keywords that are used as a part of the history tracking mechanism to select specific versions of a data item, and a set of UPA options that select specific versions based on possible future decisions of PIs. We implemented our query interface mechanism on top of Apache Phoenix, taking into consideration that the UPA system was implemented on top of Apache HBase. We test the performance of the UPA query language by executing several queries that contain different complexity levels and discuss their results."

abstract,"Abstract The abundance of mined, predicted and uncertain biological data warrant massive, efficient and scalable curation efforts. The human expertise required for any successful curation enterprise is often economically prohibitive, especially for speculative end user queries that ultimately may not bear fruit. So the challenge remains in devising a low cost engine capable of delivering fast but tentative annotation and curation of a set of data items that can later be authoritatively validated by experts demanding significantly smaller investment. The aim thus is to make a large volume of predicted data available for use as early as possible with an acceptable degree of confidence in their accuracy while the curation continues. In this paper, we present a novel approach to annotation and curation of biological database contents using crowd computing. The technical contribution is in the identification and management of trust of mechanical turks, and support for ad hoc declarative queries, both of which are leveraged to enable reliable analytics using noisy predicted interactions. While the proposed approach and the CrowdCure system are designed for literature mined protein-protein interaction data curation, they are amenable to substantial generalization."

history,"['2018-03', '2017-10-20']"
abstract,"Abstract Fast, massive, and viral data diffused on social media affects a large share of the online population, and thus, the (prospective) information diffusion mechanisms behind it are of great interest to researchers. The (retrospective) provenance of such data is equally important because it contributes to the understanding of the relevance and trustworthiness of the information. Furthermore, computing provenance in a timely way is crucial for particular use cases and practitioners, such as online journalists that promptly need to assess specific pieces of information. Social media currently provide insufficient mechanisms for provenance tracking, publication and generation, while state-of-the-art on social media research focuses mainly on explicit diffusion mechanisms (like retweets in Twitter or reshares in Facebook).The implicit diffusion mechanisms remain understudied due to the difficulties of being captured and properly understood. From a technical side, the state of the art for provenance reconstruction evaluates small datasets after the fact, sidestepping requirements for scale and speed of current social media data. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms of implicit information diffusion by computing its fine-grained provenance. We prove that explicit mechanisms are insufficient to capture influence and our analysis unravels a significant part of implicit interactions and influence in social media. Our approach works incrementally and can be scaled up to cover a truly Web-scale scenario like major events. We can process datasets consisting of up to several millions of messages on a single machine at rates that cover bursty behaviour, without compromising result quality. By doing that, we provide to online journalists and social media users in general, fine grained provenance reconstruction which sheds lights on implicit interactions not captured by social media providers. These results are provided in an online fashion which also allows for fast relevance and trustworthiness assessment."

abstract,"Abstract Enabling provenance interoperability by analyzing heterogeneous provenance information from different scientific workflow management systems is a novel research topic. With the advent of the ProvONE model, it is now possible to model both the prospective as well as the retrospective provenance in a single provenance model. Scientific workflows are composed using a declarative definition language, such as BPEL, SCUFL/t2flow, or MoML. Associated with the execution of a workflow is its corresponding provenance that is modeled and stored in the data model specified by the workflow system. However, sharing of provenance generated by heterogeneous workflows is a challenging task and prevents the aggregate analysis and comparison of workflows and their associated provenance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a ProvONE-based Provenance Interoperability Framework that completely automates the modeling of provenance from heterogeneous WfMSs by: (a) automatically translating the scientific workflows to their equivalent representation in a ProvONE prospective graph using the Prov2ONE algorithm, (b) enriching the ProvONE prospective graph with the retrospective provenance exported by the WfMSs, and (c) native support for storing the ProvONE provenance graphs in a Resource Description Framework triplestore that supports the SPARQL query language for querying and retrieving ProvONE graphs. The Prov2ONE algorithm is based on a set of vocabulary translation rules between workflow specifications and the ProvONE model. The correctness and completeness proof of the algorithm is shown and its complexity is analyzed. Moreover, to demonstrate the practical applicability of the complete framework, ProvONE graphs for workflows defined in BPEL, SCUFL, and MoML are generated. Finally, the provenance challenge queries are extended with six additional queries for retrieving the provenance modeled in ProvONE."

abstract,"Abstract The tremendous growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) accumulates and exposes an abundance of unresolved real-world entities that are exposed to public Web databases. Entity resolution (ER) is the vital prerequisite for leveraging and resolving Web entities that describe the same real-world objects. Data blocking is a popular method for addressing Web entities and grouping similar entity profiles without duplication. The existing ER techniques apply hierarchical blocking to ease dimensionality reduction. Canopy clustering is a pre-clustering method for increasing processing speed. However, it performs a pairwise comparison of the entities, which results in a computationally intensive process. Moreover, conventional data-blocking techniques have limited control over both the block size and overlapping blocks, despite the significance of blocking quality in many potential applications. This paper proposes a Real-Delegate (Resolving Entity on A Large scale: DEtermining Linked Entities and Grouping similar Attributes represented in assorted TErminologies) that exploits attribute-based unsupervised hierarchical blocking as well as meta-blocking without relying on pre-clustering. The proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency of the blocking function in three phases. In the initial phase, the Real-Delegate approach links the multiple sets of equivalent entity descriptions using Linked Open Data (LOD) to integrate multiple Web sources. The next phase employs attribute-based unsupervised hierarchical blocking with rough set theory (RST), which considerably reduces superfluous comparisons. Finally, the Real-Delegate approach eliminates a redundant entity by employing a graph-based meta-blocking model that represents a redundancy-positive block and removes overlapping profiles effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the effectiveness of entity resolution compared with the token blocking method in a large-scale Web dataset."

abstract,"Abstract This paper describes a novel method to couple a standalone database management system (DBMS) with a highly scalable key-value store. The system employs Apache Cassandra as data storage and the extensible DBMS Secondo as a query processing engine. The resulting system is a distributed, general-purpose DBMS which is highly scalable and fault tolerant. The logical ring of Cassandra is used to split up input data into smaller units of work (UOWs), which can be processed independently. A decentralized algorithm is responsible to assign the UOWs to query processing nodes. In case of a node failure, UOWs are recalculated on a different node. All the data models (e.g. relational, spatial and spatio-temporal) and functions (e.g. filter, aggregates, joins and spatial-joins) implemented in Secondo can be used in a scalable way without changing the implementation. Many aspects of the distribution are hidden from the user. Existing sequential queries can be easily converted into parallel ones."

abstract,"Abstract Graph problems are significantly harder to solve with large graphs residing on disk compared to main memory only. In this work, we study how to solve four important graph problems: reachability from a source vertex, single source shortest path, weakly connected components, and PageRank. It is well known that the aforementioned algorithms can be expressed as an iteration of matrix–vector multiplications under different semi-rings. Based on this mathematical foundation, we show how to express the computation with standard relational queries and then we study how to efficiently evaluate them in parallel in a shared-nothing architecture. We identify a common algorithmic pattern that unifies the four graph algorithms, considering a common mathematical foundation based on sparse matrix–vector multiplication. The net gain is that our SQL-based approach enables solving “big data” graph problems on parallel database systems, debunking common wisdom that they are cumbersome and slow. Using large social networks and hyper-link real data sets, we present performance comparisons between a columnar DBMS, an open-source array DBMS, and Spark’s GraphX."

abstract,"Abstract Most distributed data mining algorithms can efficiently manage and mine complete data from distributed resources. However, for an incomplete data some modifications are required in order to perform distributed data mining techniques and maintaining the privacy of the sensitive information to provide pretty good results of data mining. Classification is important tasks of data mining aimed at discovering knowledge and classify new instances. SVM is classified as one of the most important algorithm used for classification problems in several various spheres. In this paper, we proposed a new distributed privacy-preserving protocol with multiple imputations of missing or incomplete data. More so, a multiple imputations based on multivariate imputation by chained equations is used for missing data and Paillier cryptosystem for maintaining the privacy of the participants. Finally we constructed a global SVM model by introducing a third party (semi-honest approach) over vertical partition data based in Gram matrix without revealing the privacy of the data and used to classify new instances. The performance evolution of the proposed protocol was investigated while using accuracy metric on the distributed and centralized data. Results  of our experiments reveal that the accuracy is the same as centralized data and achieve better results with imputed data while compared with omitted data. The performance of distributed data on our protocol achieves better processing time compared with centralized data."

abstract,"Abstract With the development of cloud service technologies, the amount of services grows rapidly, leading to building high-quality services an urgent and crucial research problem. Service users should evaluate QoS to select the optimal cloud services from a series of functionally equivalent service candidates, because QoS performance of services is varying over time. The reason is that QoS is related to the service overload and network environments. This phenomenon makes QoS prediction for users located in different places even harder. Furthermore, since service invocations are charged by service providers, it is impractical to let users invoke required cloud services to evaluate quality with respect to time and resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a cloud service QoS prediction method, called TPP (Time-aware and Parallel Prediction), to provide time-aware and parallel QoS value prediction for various service users. TPP is able to predict without additional invocation of cloud services, since it uses past cloud service usage experience from different service users. We propose and implement tensor decomposition algorithm on the Spark system. The results of extensive experimental show the accuracy and efficiency of TPP."

abstract,"Abstract Federated cloud enables data sharing across different organizations. This paper proposes a distributed search index (DS-index) solution to provide distributed search capability in federated cloud, with the target to support multi-attribute range queries with secondary indexes. DS-index deploys a three-layer architecture with a multi-attribute index overlay, a tree-based P2P network layer, and a federated cloud layer. We present a distributed search algorithm with the three-layer architecture. In order to facilitate distributed search, we propose a dynamic mapping algorithm for DS-index to map between different layers. In addition, a Markov Chain-based cost model is defined to facilitate node selection and mapping. With the dynamic mapping algorithm and cost model, the proposed DS-index solution is more cost-effective than the traditional P2P networks as it can reduce the network cost in terms of index maintenance cost and node selection cost. The experiments demonstrate that, our DS-index solution along with its cost model can save the computation resource and reduce network bandwidth consumption by around 30% comparing to the one without cost model. It can also reduce the number of node splits/merges by around 20% comparing to the state-of-the-art solution."

abstract,"Abstract In the last decade, skyline query processing has become widely important because of its usefulness in decision making applications. Since the size of the datasets used for skyline query processing are huge, algorithms for MapReduce-based skyline query processing have been widely studied. However, existing algorithms suffer from low-filtering efficiency for local skyline computation, and unrealistically assume both uniform data distributions and dimensional independence. In this paper, we propose a parallel skyline query processing algorithm for MapReduce using multiple regression analysis. The goal of our algorithm is to efficiently find a set of skylines from a large dataset by reducing the number of candidates prior to the skyline computation. To develop the skyline computation algorithm on anti-correlated datasets, we computed a data filtering threshold line based on a multiple regression analysis of the sampled dataset. To guarantee the accuracy of the skyline result, we considered both a filtering threshold line and a grid-based cell dominance condition. Thus, only relevant data could be computed in the real skyline computation step. For local skyline computation, we utilized an angle-based partitioning of data space that effectively eliminates non-promising points in partitions. For the global skyline computation, we used the dominance relationship among grid-based partitions to prune out unnecessary skyline points. Performance analyses showed that our parallel skyline query processing algorithm outperformed existing algorithms, under various settings."

abstract,"Abstract Most modern networks are perpetually evolving and can be modeled by graph data structures. By collecting and indexing the state of a graph at various time instances we are able to perform queries on its entire history and thus gain insight into its fundamental features and attributes. This calls for advanced solutions for graph history storing and indexing that are capable of supporting application queries efficiently while coping with the aggravated space requirements. To this end, we advocate a purely vertex-centric storage model that is asymptotically space-optimal and more space efficient than any other proposal to date. In addition to space efficiency, the model’s purely vertex-centric approach shows great promise with respect to the efficiency and functionality of update and query operations. Furthermore, we make a qualitative comparison with other general methods for graph history storage identifying the pros and cons of our approach. Finally, we implement and incorporate our technique in the \(G^*\) parallel graph processing system, we conduct thorough experimental evaluation and we show that we can yield time and space improvements up to an order of magnitude when compared to \(G^*\)."

abstract,"Abstract In recent year, many large-scale iterative graph computation systems such as Pregel have been developed. To ensure that these systems are fault-tolerant, checkpointing, which archives graph states onto distributed file systems periodically, has been proposed. However, fault-tolerance remains to be challenging because the whole data set is archived with a static interval, rendering underlying graph computations to entail I/O-costs in terms of disk and network communication. Motivated by this, we first propose to dynamically adjust checkpoint intervals based on a carefully designed cost-analysis model, by taking the underlying computing workload into account. Furthermore, for algorithms that can be restarted from any point during computations, we prioritize graph states and then checkpointing can be performed with selected data, instead of the entire dataset, to reduce archiving overhead while simultaneously guaranteeing the failure recovery efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive performance studies to confirm the effectiveness of our approaches over existing up-to-date solutions using a broad spectrum of real-world graphs."

abstract,"Abstract Popular distributed graph processing frameworks, such as Pregel and GraphLab, are based on the vertex-centric computation model, where users write their customized Compute function for each vertex to process the data iteratively. Vertices are evenly partitioned among the compute nodes, and the granularity of parallelism of the graph algorithm is normally tuned by adjusting the number of compute nodes. Vertex-centric model splits the computation into phases. Inside one specific phase, the computation proceeds as an embarrassingly parallel process, because no communication between compute nodes incurs. By default, current graph engine only handles one iteration of the algorithm in a phase. However, in this paper, we find that we can also tune the granularity of parallelism, by aggregating the computation of multiple iterations into one phase, which has a significant impact on the performance of the graph algorithm. In the ideal case, if all computations are handled in one phase, the whole algorithm turns into an embarrassingly parallel algorithm and the benefit of parallelism is maximized. Based on this observation, we propose two approaches, a function-based approach and a parameter-based approach, to automatically transform a Pregel algorithm into a new one with tunable granularity of parallelism. We study the cost of such transformation and the trade-off between the granularity of parallelism and the performance. We provide a new direction to tune the performance of parallel algorithms. Finally, the approaches are implemented in our graph processing system, N2, and we illustrate their performance using popular graph algorithms."

abstract,"Abstract This paper addresses the classical triangle listing problem, which aims at enumerating all the tuples of three vertices connected with each other by edges. This problem has been intensively studied in internal and external memory, but it is still an urgent challenge in distributed environment where multiple machines across the network can be utilized to achieve good performance and scalability. As one of the de facto computing methodologies in distributed environment, MapReduce has been used in some of existing triangle listing algorithms. However, these algorithms usually need to shuffle a huge amount of intermediate data, which seriously hinders their scalability on large scale graphs. In this paper, we propose a new triangle listing algorithm in MapReduce, FTL, which utilizes a light weight data structure to substantially reduce the intermediate data transferred during the shuffle stage, and also is equipped with multiple-round techniques to ease the burden on memory and network bandwidth when dealing with graphs at billion scale. We prove that the size of the intermediate data can be well bounded near to the number of triangles in the graph. To further reduce the shuffle size and memory cost, we also propose improved algorithms based on a compact data structure, and present several optimization techniques to accelerate the computation and reduce the memory consumption. The extensive experimental results show that our algorithms outperform existing competitors by several times on both synthetic graphs and real world graphs."

abstract,"Abstract Graph partitioning has long been seen as a viable approach to addressing Graph DBMS scalability. A partitioning, however, may introduce extra query processing latency unless it is sensitive to a specific query workload, and optimised to minimise inter-partition traversals for that workload. Additionally, it should also be possible to incrementally adjust the partitioning in reaction to changes in the graph topology, the query workload, or both. Because of their complexity, current partitioning algorithms fall short of one or both of these requirements, as they are designed for offline use and as one-off operations. The TAPER system aims to address both requirements, whilst leveraging existing partitioning algorithms. TAPER takes any given initial partitioning as a starting point, and iteratively adjusts it by swapping chosen vertices across partitions, heuristically reducing the probability of inter-partition traversals for a given path queries workload. Iterations are inexpensive thanks to time and space optimisations in the underlying support data structures. We evaluate TAPER on two different large test graphs and over realistic query workloads. Our results indicate that, given a hash-based partitioning, TAPER reduces the number of inter-partition traversals by \(\sim \)80%; given an unweighted Metis partitioning, by \(\sim \)30%. These reductions are achieved within eight iterations and with the additional advantage of being workload-aware and usable online."

abstract,"Abstract We are witnessing an enormous growth in social networks as well as in the volume of data generated by them. An important portion of this data is in the form of graphs. In recent years, several graph processing and management systems emerged to handle large-scale graphs. The primary goal of these systems is to run graph algorithms and queries in an efficient and scalable manner. Unlike relational data, graphs are semi-structured in nature. Thus, storing and accessing graph data using secondary storage requires new solutions that can provide locality of access for graph processing workloads. In this work, we propose a scalable block formation and layout technique for graphs, which aims at reducing the I/O cost of disk-based graph processing algorithms. To achieve this, we designed a scalable MapReduce-style method called ICBL, which can divide the graph into a series of disk blocks that contain sub-graphs with high locality. Furthermore, ICBL can order the resulting blocks on disk to further reduce non-local accesses. We experimentally evaluated ICBL to showcase its scalability, layout quality, as well as the effectiveness of automatic parameter tuning for ICBL. We deployed the graph layouts generated by ICBL on the Neo4j open source graph database, http://www.neo4j.org/ (2015) graph database management system. Our results show that the layout generated by ICBL reduces the query running times over Neo4j more than \(2\times \) compared to the default layout."

abstract,"Abstract The widespread use of mobile devices and the real time availability of user-location information is facilitating the development of new personalized, location-based applications and services (LBSs). Such applications require multi-attribute query processing, scalability for supporting millions of users, real-time querying capability and analyzing large volumes of data. Cloud computing aided a new generation of distributed databases commonly known as key-value stores. Key-value stores were designed to extract values from very large volumes of data while being highly available, fault-tolerant and scalable, hence providing much needed infrastructure to support LBSs. However, complex queries over multidimensional data cannot be processed efficiently as they do not provide means to access multiple attributes. In this paper, we present M-Grid, a unifying indexing and a data distribution framework which enables key-value stores to support multidimensional queries. We organize a set of nodes in a modified P-Grid overlay network which provides efficient data distribution, fault-tolerance and query processing over multidimensional data. To index, we use Hilbert Space Filling Curve based linearization technique which preserves the data locality to efficiently manage multidimensional data in a key-value store. We propose algorithms to dynamically process range and k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries on linearized values. This removes the overhead of maintaining a separate index table. Our approach is completely independent from the underlying storage layer and can be implemented on any cloud infrastructure. Our experiments on Amazon EC2 show that M-Grid achieves a performance improvement of three orders of magnitude in comparison to MapReduce and four times to that of MD-HBase scheme."

abstract,"Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become ubiquitous, e.g., in logistics, smart manufacturing, smart city infrastructures or vehicular ad-hoc networks. WSNs tend to rely on ad-hoc infrastructures that are prone to a wide range of different defects, e.g., communication failures, faulty sensors or nodes that have been tampered with. Additionally, dealing with defects is challenging, as defects might occur only occasionally. In this paper, we introduce SEDEL, our approach for Sensor nEtwork DEfect Localization. SEDEL helps the WSN operator to pinpoint defective nodes in the routing topology of a WSN. In particular, we let the operator store graph representations of the routing topology, together with information if the WSN has produced errors. Based on this information, SEDEL assigns each WSN node a suspiciousness score that is correlated with the defect probability. Thus, our approach can be used with any kind of defect, and the kind does not have to be known, as long as the operator can decide if a certain processing is correct or not. We have evaluated SEDEL with a real sensor-node deployment. Our evaluation shows that the defective node is assigned a high probability in the vast majority of the experiments."

abstract,"Abstract Preference query processing is important for a wide range of applications involving distributed databases, such as network monitoring, web-based systems, and market analysis. In such applications, data objects are generated frequently and massively, which presents an important and challenging problem of continuous query processing over distributed data stream environments. A top-k dominating query, which has been receiving much research attention recently, returns the k data objects that dominate the highest number of data objects in a given dataset, and due to its dominance-based ranking function, we can easily obtain superior data objects. An emerging requirement in distributed stream environments is an efficient technique for continuously monitoring top-k dominating data objects. Despite of this fact, no study has addressed this problem. In this paper, therefore, we address the problem of continuous top-k dominating query processing over distributed data stream environments. We present two algorithms that monitor the exact top-k dominating data and efficiently eliminate unqualified data objects for the result, which reduces both communication and computation costs. In addition to these algorithms, we present an approximate algorithm that further reduces both communication and computation costs.

abstract,"Abstract Enforcing dynamic and confidential access control policies is a challenging issue of data outsourcing to external servers due to the lack of trust towards the servers. In this paper, we propose a scalable yet flexible access control enforcement mechanism when the underlying relational data, on which access policies are defined, has been shared through a secret sharing scheme. For sharing values of an attribute in a relation, the attribute is assigned a secret distribution key and its values are split and distributed among data servers according to a Shamir based secret sharing scheme. Given access control policies over attributes of the relation schema, access to distribution keys, used further for reconstructing original values, is managed using the Chinese remainder theorem. Our solution, in addition to preserving the confidentiality of access control policies, is flexible to efficiently adopt grant and revoke of authorizations. Moreover, it prevents the possibility of information leakage caused by query processing through an access control aware retrieval of data shares. That is, our solution not only enforces access control policies for reconstructing shares and obtaining original values, but also for retrieving shares in query processing scenario. We implemented our mechanism and performed extensive experiments, whose results confirm its efficiency and considerable scalability in practice."

abstract,"Abstract The top-k query on uncertain data set has been a very hot topic these years, and there have been many studies on uncertain top-k queries. Unfortunately, most of the existing algorithms only consider centralized processing environments, and they are not suitable for the large-scale data. In this paper, it is the first attempt to process probabilistic threshold top-k queries (an important uncertain top-k query, PT-k for short) in a distributed environment. We propose 3 efficient algorithms. The serial distributed approach adopts a new method, which only requires a few amount of calculations, to serially process PT-k queries in distributed environments. The global sorting first algorithm for PT-k query processing (GSP) is designed for improving the computation speed. In GSP, a distributed sorting operation is performed, and then we compute the candidates for PT-k queries in parallel. The query results can be computed by using a novel incremental method which can reduce the number of calculations. The local filtering first algorithm for PT-k query processing is designed for reducing the network overhead. Specifically, several filtering strategies are proposed to filter out redundant data locally, and then the incremental method in GSP is used to process the PT-k queries. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms is verified through a series of experiments."

history,"['2016-12', '2015-09-25']"
abstract,"Abstract The blooming of different cloud data management infrastructures, specialized for different kinds of data and tasks, has led to a wide diversification of DBMS interfaces and the loss of a common programming paradigm. In this paper, we present the design of a cloud multidatastore query language (CloudMdsQL), and its query engine. CloudMdsQL is a functional SQL-like language, capable of querying multiple heterogeneous data stores (relational and NoSQL) within a single query that may contain embedded invocations to each data store’s native query interface. The query engine has a fully distributed architecture, which provides important opportunities for optimization. The major innovation is that a CloudMdsQL query can exploit the full power of local data stores, by simply allowing some local data store native queries (e.g. a breadth-first search query against a graph database) to be called as functions, and at the same time be optimized, e.g. by pushing down select predicates, using bind join, performing join ordering, or planning intermediate data shipping. Our experimental validation, with three data stores (graph, document and relational) and representative queries, shows that CloudMdsQL satisfies the five important requirements for a cloud multidatastore query language."

abstract,"Abstract Cloud computing systems handle large volumes of data by using almost unlimited computational resources, while spatial data warehouses (SDWs) are multidimensional databases that store huge volumes of both spatial data and conventional data. Cloud computing environments have been considered adequate to host voluminous databases, process analytical workloads and deliver database as a service, while spatial online analytical processing (spatial OLAP) queries issued over SDWs are intrinsically analytical. However, hosting a SDW in the cloud and processing spatial OLAP queries over such database impose novel obstacles. In this article, we introduce novel concepts as cloud SDW and spatial OLAP as a service, and afterwards detail the design of novel schemas for cloud SDW and spatial OLAP query processing over cloud SDW. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance to process spatial OLAP queries in cloud SDWs using our own query processor aided by a cloud spatial index. Moreover, we describe the cloud spatial bitmap index to improve the performance to process spatial OLAP queries in cloud SDWs, and assess it through an experimental evaluation. Results  derived from our experiments revealed that such index was capable to reduce the query response time from 58.20 up to 98.89 %."

We consider the radial visualizations and we describe our approach (called POIViz) that uses points of interest to determine a layout of a large dataset. We detail its parallelization on the CPU and the GPU. We study the efficiency of this approach with different configurations and for large datasets. We show that it can visualize, in less than one second, millions of data with tens of dimensions, and that it can support “real-time” interactions even for large datasets. We conclude on the advantages and limits of the proposed visualization."

abstract,"Abstract In today’s knowledge-, service-, and cloud-based economy, businesses accumulate massive amounts of data from a variety of sources. In order to understand businesses one may need to perform considerable analytics over large hybrid collections of heterogeneous and partially unstructured data that is captured related to the process execution. This data, usually modeled as graphs, increasingly come to show all the typical properties of big data: wide physical distribution, diversity of formats, non-standard data models, independently-managed and heterogeneous semantics. We use the term big process graph to refer to such large hybrid collections of heterogeneous and partially unstructured process related execution data. Online analytical processing (OLAP) of big process graph is challenging as the extension of existing OLAP techniques to analysis of graphs is not straightforward. Moreover, process data analysis methods should be capable of processing and querying large amount of data effectively and efficiently, and therefore have to be able to scale well with the infrastructure’s scale. While traditional analytics solutions (relational DBs, data warehouses and OLAP), do a great job in collecting data and providing answers on known questions, key business insights remain hidden in the interactions among objects: it will be hard to discover concept hierarchies for entities based on both data objects and their interactions in process graphs. In this paper, we introduce a framework and a set of methods to support scalable graph-based OLAP analytics over process execution data. The goal is to facilitate the analytics over big process graph through summarizing the process graph and providing multiple views at different granularity. To achieve this goal, we present a model for process OLAP (P-OLAP) and define OLAP specific abstractions in process context such as process cubes, dimensions, and cells. We present a MapReduce-based graph processing engine, to support big data analytics over process graphs. We have implemented the P-OLAP framework and integrated it into our existing process data analytics platform, ProcessAtlas, which introduces a scalable architecture for querying, exploration and analysis of large process data. We report on experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world datasets that show the viability and efficiency of the approach."

This type of memory had notable consequences on data acquisition performance, with a substantial drop compared with hard disk drives. In this setting, we have designed Chronos, an open-source NoSQL system for sensor data management on flash memories. Chronos includes an efficient quasi-sequential write pattern along with an index management technique adapted for process data management. As a result, Chronos supports a higher velocity for inserted data, with acquisition rates improved by a factor of 20–54 over different solutions, therefore solving a practical bottleneck for EDF."

abstract,"Abstract A nearest neighbor (NN) query, which returns the most similar object to a user-specified query object, plays an important role in a wide range of applications and hence has received considerable attention. In many such applications, e.g., sensor data collection and location-based services, objects are inherently uncertain. Furthermore, due to the ever increasing generation of massive datasets, the importance of distributed databases, which deal with such data objects, has been growing. One emerging challenge is to efficiently process probabilistic NN queries over distributed uncertain databases. The straightforward approach, that each local site forwards its own database to the central server, is communication-expensive, so we have to minimize communication cost for the NN object retrieval. In this paper, we focus on two important queries, namely top-k probable NN queries and probabilistic star queries, and propose efficient algorithms to process them over distributed uncertain databases. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data have demonstrated that our algorithms significantly reduce communication cost."

abstract,"Abstract The research presented in this paper supports the identification of common subexpressions as candidates for potential materialized views that form the basis of multiple query optimization in a loosely-coupled distributed system where query expressions access heterogeneous data sources, including relations and data-centric XML. This paper introduces a unifying mixed multigraph formalism to represent SQL, XQuery, and LINQ queries in a common query graph model and a heuristics-based algorithm to detect common subexpressions. The identified common subexpressions represent an opportunity for defining a materialized view to avoid repeating computation. The common subexpressions may access only relations, only XML, or a combination of relations and XML. The mixed multigraph model and the heuristic rules presented in this paper have distinguished advantages over the existing approaches that consider only relational or XML data sources individually. The mixed multigraph model can present SQL, XQuery, and LINQ queries in a single graph model and the heuristic rules are designed to consider the identical and subsumed conditions at the same time. A prototype implementation of the algorithm illustrates the applicability of the approach using various examples from the research literature as well as scenarios over a Criminal Justice enterprise that include common subexpressions across relational and XML data sources."

abstract,"Abstract Quality of service (QoS) can be a critical element for achieving the business goals of a service provider, and accepting a service by the customer. The criticality is more pronounced when the service provider handles the non-functional QoS attribute of privacy, i.e., privacy related to the customer’s personal data. In this regard, the customer needs some guarantee(s) from the service provider about confidentiality management, leading to overall quality characterization of the provided service. A service level agreement (SLA) is primarily intended to specify (in terms of clauses) the level of such non-functional QoS delivered to the customer. The aim is to provide customers with tools that show the fulfillment of QoS guarantees, through SLA monitoring process. In this paper, we address the problem of usage control of private data in service based applications ensuring end-to-end QoS capabilities. We propose a query containment based approach to support the monitoring of privacy-aware SLA compliance, that spells out a customer’s privacy rights, and shows how the customer’s private information must be handled by a Web service provider. We introduce the private data usage flow model upon which the monitoring is performed to observe the data usage flow, and capture the privacy vulnerabilities that may lead to non-compliance. The model is built on top of (i) properties and time-related privacy requirements to be monitored, and (ii) a set of identified privacy violations. As proof of concept, a privacy aware SLA monitoring system, which is an easy-to-use, and efficient tool for observing the dynamic private data usage flow is developed. Experiment results indicate the relevance and applicability of the proposed approach."

abstract,"Abstract Effective caching in mobile ad hoc network increases data availability. However, caching at strategic locations with reduced (controlled) number of copies is needed for many military applications involving UAVs to address security concerns, less maintenance overhead and maintaining availability. In general, existing cooperative caching approaches are deficient in finding the reduced number of strategic cache locations. One such technique to reduce the number of strategic cache locations without affecting the efficacy of data access for a small network topology of UAVs is called “memory and location optimized caching scheme (MELOC)”. However, having a single broker and metadata broadcast across the whole network in MELOC lead to severe performance hindrance in case of a large network topology of UAVs. Moreover, frequent cache replacements due to a change in network topology do not favor cache hit and bandwidth conservation in case of large mobile networks consisting of UAVs. In this paper, we design and evaluate an extended version of “MELOC called MELOC-X”, which suits large network topologies of UAVs by overcoming the above challenges. Our comparison with one such recent scheme with similar objectives showcased a significant improvement in performance. We also evaluate the impact of this scheme with respect to different metrics including the average number of hops, the average roundtrip time (i.e., average query latency), cache hits and mobility to access cached data through extensive simulations."

abstract,"Abstract As we delve deeper into the ‘Digital Age’, we witness an explosive growth in the volume, velocity, and variety of the data available on the Internet. For example, in 2012 about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data was created on a daily basis that originated from myriad of sources and applications including mobile devices, sensors, individual archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprises, cameras, software logs, etc. Such ‘Data Explosions’ has led to one of the most challenging research issues of the current Information and Communication Technology era: how to optimally manage (e.g., store, replicated, filter, and the like) such large amount of data and identify new ways to analyze large amounts of data for unlocking information. It is clear that such large data streams cannot be managed by setting up on-premises enterprise database systems as it leads to a large up-front cost in buying and administering the hardware and software systems. Therefore, next generation data management systems must be deployed on cloud. The cloud computing paradigm provides scalable and elastic resources, such as data and services accessible over the Internet Every Cloud Service Provider must assure that data is efficiently processed and distributed in a way that does not compromise end-users’ Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of data availability, data search delay, data analysis delay, and the like. In the aforementioned perspective, data replication is used in the cloud for improving the performance (e.g., read and write delay) of applications that access data. Through replication a data intensive application or system can achieve high availability, better fault tolerance, and data recovery. In this paper, we survey data management and replication approaches (from 2007 to 2011) that are developed by both industrial and research communities. The focus of the survey is to discuss and characterize the existing approaches of data replication and management that tackle the resource usage and QoS provisioning with different levels of efficiencies. Moreover, the breakdown of both influential expressions (data replication and management) to provide different QoS attributes is deliberated. Furthermore, the performance advantages and disadvantages of data replication and management approaches in the cloud computing environments are analyzed. Open issues and future challenges related to data consistency, scalability, load balancing, processing and placement are also reported."

This paper proposes a practical solution to these problems, which does not cause any network overload and does not affect the data management of connections. Furthermore, it has been fully implemented in a new tool developed to create a vehicular ad-hoc network using only smartphones. Both a straightforward deterministic algorithm and a more complex scheme taking into account the interferences between wireless channels from a fuzzy logic point of view are defined here. Promising results regarding performance and security have been obtained from the analysis of large-scale NS2 simulations based on data got from implementations with real devices."

Next generation smartphone applications are expected to be much larger-scale and complex, demanding that these undergo evaluation and testing under different real-world datasets, devices and conditions. In this paper, we present an architecture for managing such large-scale data management experiments on real smartphones. We particularly present the building blocks of our architecture that encompassed smartphone sensor data collected by the crowd and organized in our big data repository. The given datasets can then be replayed on our testbed comprising of real and simulated smartphones accessible to developers through a web-based interface. We present the applicability of our architecture through a case study that involves the evaluation of individual components that are part of a complex indoor positioning system for smartphones, coined Anyplace, which we have developed over the years. The given study shows how our architecture allows us to derive novel insights into the performance of our algorithms and applications, by simplifying the management of large-scale data on smartphones."

Spatial observation data includes both data of conventional entities and also samplings over multi-dimensional spaces. Existing observation data management solutions lack declarative specification of spatio-temporal analytics. On the other hand, current data management technologies miss observation data semantics and fail to integrate the management of entities and samplings in a single data modeling solution. The present paper presents the design of a framework that enables spatio-temporal declarative analysis over large warehouses of observation data. It integrates the management of entities and samplings within a simple data model based on the well known mathematical concept of function. Observation data semantics are incorporated into the model with appropriate metadata structures."

abstract,"Abstract In consumer products market, supply chain management (SCM) is a complex and significant issue in the governance of organizations, people with their activities, technology, information and resources involved in transferring a product or service from a supplier to a final customer. To this aim, radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a promising wireless technology allowing to link an object with its “virtual counterpart”, i.e., its representation within information systems. In this context, a SCM system has to face a huge amount of RFID data, generated in the tracking of supply chain resources. In particular when RFID installations become larger and more physically distributed, efficient and scalable analysis of such data becomes a concern. Currently, state of the art approaches provide hard-coded solutions where the processing of RFID data occurs in a central location; as the amount and distribution of data grow, the workload requires significant consumption of resources, and quickly outpaces the capacity of a centralized processing server. In this paper, we consider the problem of distributing the RFID processing workload—possibly huge—proposing the physical design of a scalable and distributed system. Such system is built on top of a general framework for SCM, based on the first principles of linear algebra, in particular, on tensorial calculus. We consider challenges in instantiating such a system in large distributed settings, and design techniques for distributed real time query processing. Experimental results, using large traces, demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our proposal with respect to competing approaches."

Unfortunately, graph matching is typically performed in terms of subgraph isomorphism, which makes semantic data querying a hard problem. In this paper we illustrate a novel technique for querying RDF data in which the answers are built by combining paths of the underlying data graph that align with paths specified by the query. The approach is approximate and generates the combinations of the paths that best align with the query. We show that, in this way, the complexity of the overall process is significantly reduced and verify experimentally that our framework exhibits an excellent behavior with respect to other approaches in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness."

abstract,"Abstract Graph is an extremely versatile data structure in terms of its expressiveness and flexibility to model a range of real life phenomenon. Various networks like social networks, sensor networks and computer networks are represented and stored in the form of graphs. The analysis of these kind of graphs has an immense importance from quite a long time. It is performed from various aspects to get maximum out of such multifaceted information repository. When the analysis is targeted towards finding groups of vertices based on their similarity in a graph, clustering is the most conspicuous option. Previous graph clustering approaches either focus on the topological structure or attributes likeness, however, few recent methods constitutes both aspects simultaneously. Due to enormous computation requirements for similarity estimation, these methods are often suffered from scalability issues. In order to overcome this limitation, we introduce collaborative similarity measure (CSM) for intra-graph clustering. CSM is based on shortest path strategy, instead of all paths, to define structural and semantic relevance among vertices. First, we calculate the pair-wise similarity among vertices using CSM. Second, vertices are grouped together based on calculated similarity under k-Medoid framework. Empirical analysis, based on density, and entropy, proves the efficacy of CSM over existing measures. Moreover, CSM becomes a potential candidate for medium scaled graph analysis due to an order of magnitude less computations."

abstract,"Abstract From sensor networks to transportation infrastructure to social networks, we are awash in data. Many of these real-world networks tend to be large (“big data”) and dynamic, evolving over time. Their evolution can be modeled as a series of graphs. Traditional systems that store and analyze one graph at a time cannot effectively handle the complexity and subtlety inherent in dynamic graphs. Modern analytics require systems capable of storing and processing series of graphs. We present such a system. G* compresses dynamic graph data based on commonalities among the graphs in the series for deduplicated storage on multiple servers. In addition to the obvious space-saving advantage, large-scale graph processing tends to be I/O bound, so faster reads from and writes to stable storage enable faster results. Unlike traditional database and graph processing systems, G* executes complex queries on large graphs using distributed operators to process graph data in parallel. It speeds up queries on multiple graphs by processing graph commonalities only once and sharing the results across relevant graphs. This architecture not only provides scalability, but since G* is not limited to processing only what is available in RAM, its analysis capabilities are far greater than other systems which are limited to what they can hold in memory. This paper presents G*’s design and implementation principles along with evaluation results that document its unique benefits over traditional graph processing systems."

history,"['2015-12', '2014-02-11']"
abstract,"Abstract The Linked Open Data (LOD) graph represents a web-scale distributed knowledge graph interlinking information about entities across various domains. A core concept is the lack of pre-defined schema which actually allows for flexibly modelling data from all kinds of domains. However, Linked Data does exhibit schema information in a twofold way: by explicitly attaching RDF types to the entities and implicitly by using domain-specific properties to describe the entities. In this paper, we present and apply different techniques for investigating the schematic information encoded in the LOD graph at different levels of granularity. We investigate different information theoretic properties of so-called Unique Subject URIs (USUs) and measure the correlation between the properties and types that can be observed for USUs on a large-scale semantic graph data set. Our analysis provides insights into the information encoded in the different schema characteristics. Two major findings are that implicit schema information is far more discriminative and that applications involving schema information based on either types or properties alone will only capture between 63.5 and 88.1 % of the schema information contained in the data. As the level of discrimination depends on how data providers model and publish their data, we have conducted in a second step an investigation based on pay-level domains (PLDs) as well as the semantic level of vocabularies. Overall, we observe that most data providers combine up to 10 vocabularies to model their data and that every fifth PLD uses a highly structured schema."

abstract,"Abstract The effective management of enormous data volumes on the Cloud platform has attracted devoting research efforts. In this paper, we study the problem of allocating files with multidimensional correlations on the Cloud platform, such that files can be retrieved and processed more efficiently. Currently, most prevailing Cloud file systems allocate data following the principles of fault tolerance and availability, while inter-file correlations, i.e. files correlated with each other, are often neglected. As a matter of fact, data files are commonly correlated in various ways in real practices. And correlated files are most likely to be involved in the same computation process. Therefore, it raises a new challenge of allocating files with multi-dimensional correlations with the “subspace locality” taken into consideration to improve the system throughput. We propose two allocation methods for multi-dimensional correlated files stored on the Cloud platform, such that the I/O efficiency and data access locality are improved in the MapReduce processing paradigm, without hurting the fault tolerance and availability properties of the underlying file systems. Different from the techniques proposed in [1,2], which quickly map the locations of desired data for a given query \({\mathcal {Q}}\), we focus on improving the system throughput for batch jobs over correlated data files. We clearly formulate the problem and study a series of solutions on HDFS [9]. Evaluations with real application scenarios prove the effectiveness of our proposals: significant I/O and network costs can be saved during the data retrieval and processing. Especially for batch OLAP jobs, our solution demonstrates well balanced workload among distributed computing nodes."

history,"['2015-09', '2014-09-27']"
abstract,"Abstract Flash-memory-based solid state drives (SSD) have been widely used in computer systems. Due to the high price and some specific features of SSD such as asymmetric read/write speeds and limited erasure endurance, it has been a very common solution, e.g., in modern data centers, to use hybrid storage systems involving SSD and traditional hard disks (HDD). However, the SSD/HDD-based hybrid storage systems introduce some new problems in the indexing schemes for data management. In this paper, we propose a new B+-tree-based index for such hybrid storage systems, which is called HybridB tree. The HybridB tree aims to reduce the random writes to SSD while keeping high time performance and low buffer costs. Particularly, we introduce a new design called huge leaf to avoid the splits and merges on B+-tree. A huge leaf node contains two or more leaf nodes in different states. We place the leaf nodes on HDD or SSD according to their current states, and dynamically adapt the states of leaf nodes when they are read or updated. After a detailed explanation on the structure and operations of the HybridB tree, we give a theoretical analysis on the costs of the HybridB tree. Then, we conduct experiments on two TPC-C traces, using a real hybrid storage system including one HDD and two SSDs, and compare the performance of our proposal with two implementations of B+-tree, namely the B+-tree on HDD and the B+-tree on SSD/HDD. The results show that our proposal has the best time performance and the fewest buffer costs. Moreover, our proposal is able to effectively reduce the random writes to SSD."

abstract,"Abstract Outlier detection, also known as anomaly detection, is a common data mining task in identifying data points that are outside expected patterns in a given dataset. It has useful applications such as network intrusion, system faults, and fraudulent activity. In addition, real world data are uncertain in nature and they may be represented as uncertain data. In this paper, we propose an improved parallel algorithm for outlier detection on uncertain data using density sampling and develop an implementation running on both GPUs and multi-core CPUs, using the OpenCL framework. Our main focus is on GPUs, as they are a cost effective massively parallel floating point processor that is suitable for many data mining applications. Our implementation exploits some key features in GPUs, and is significantly different from a traditional CPU implementation. We first present an improved uncertain outlier detection algorithm. Then, we demonstrate two parallel micro-clustering implementations. The performance and detection quality comparisons demonstrate the benefits of the improved algorithm and parallel implementation on GPUs."

abstract,"Abstract Location privacy is a major obstacle in the ubiquitous deployment of mobile and pervasive computing services. In this study, we present a new approach for preserving the trajectory privacy of moving \(k\)-nearest neighbor (M\(k\)NN) queries in road networks. Several location anonymization algorithms have been proposed for providing location privacy to users traveling on a road network. These algorithms focus primarily on the location anonymization of snapshot queries. Indeed, users move freely and arbitrarily, and thus query results provided to them soon become invalid as their locations change. To refresh the query result, each user must therefore periodically contact the location-based service, enabling attackers to identify and track the user easily. In addition, frequent location updates for the user may incur severe computational and communication costs. We address these issues by proposing a privacy-aware monitoring algorithm, called PAMA, for preserving the trajectory privacy of M\(k\)NN queries in road networks. Our simulation results show that PAMA significantly outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of both security and performance."

abstract,"Abstract Evaluating the performance of scientific data processing systems is a difficult task considering the plethora of application-specific solutions available in this landscape and the lack of a generally-accepted benchmark. The dual structure of scientific data coupled with the complex nature of processing complicate the evaluation procedure further. SS-DB is the first attempt to define a general benchmark for complex scientific processing over raw and derived data. It fails to draw sufficient attention though because of the ambiguous plain language specification and the extraordinary SciDB results. In this paper, we remedy the shortcomings of the original SS-DB specification by providing a formal representation in terms of ArrayQL algebra operators and ArrayQL/SciQL constructs. These are the first formal representations of the SS-DB benchmark. Starting from the formal representation, we give a reference implementation and present benchmark results in EXTASCID, a novel system for scientific data processing. EXTASCID is complete in providing native support both for array and relational data and extensible in executing any user code inside the system by the means of a configurable metaoperator. These features result in significant improvement over SciDB at data loading, extracting derived data, and operations over derived data."

abstract,"Abstract Query processing over uncertain data is very important in many applications due to the existence of uncertainty in real-world data. In this paper, we first elaborate a new and important query in the context of an uncertain database, namely uncertain top-(k,l) range (UTR) query, which retrieves \(l\) uncertain tuples that are expected to meet score range constraint [\(CR_1\),\(CR_2\)] and have the maximum top-k probabilities but no less than a user-specified probability threshold \(q\). In order to enable the UTR query answer faster, we put forward some effective pruning rules to reduce the UTR query space, which are integrated into an efficient UTR query procedure. What’s more, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the UTR query, a parallel UTR (PUTR) query procedure is presented. Extensive experiments have verified the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. It is worth to notice that, comparing to the UTR query procedure, the PUTR query procedure performs much more efficiently and effectively."

history,"['2015-06', '2014-03-21']"
abstract,"Abstract Many applications require understanding how event occurrences at one geographical region affect or influence event occurrences at another region, e.g. spread of disease and forest fires. Existing works typically impose a grid to partition the spatial space and utilize spatial autocorrelation property to model the spatial dependency among the grid cells. However, they are often highly sensitive to the granularity of the grid size and they do not incorporate the temporal dynamics of the event occurrences among regions. This paper utilizes the notion of a spatial network with temporal dependency to capture the dynamics of event occurrences among regions. This network is modeled as a directed graph where each node is a group of spatially nearby events and each directed edge represents the influence of events from a source node to a destination node. We design an algorithm called LinkNet to generate this network from spatio-temporal event databases. LinkNet utilizes minimum description length based information–theoretic approach to automatically adjust the number of regions and the temporal relationships among regions. Two optimizations are devised to reduce the computational complexity of LinkNet. We also demonstrate how the proposed network can be used for hotspot prediction. Experiment results on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of LinkNet and the effectiveness of the network in predicting the next hotspots."

abstract,"Abstract The widespread use of GPS navigations and trip planning on web has aroused considerable interests in fast and scalable path query processing. Existing research has mostly focused on static route optimization where the traffic network is assumed to be stable. Nevertheless, in most cases, route planning is in the presence of frequent updates to the traffic graph due to the dynamic nature of traffic network, and such updates always greatly affect the performance of route planning. Most existing methods, however, cannot efficiently support traffic aware route planning. In this paper, two efficient strategies are proposed to handle this problem. We analyze the traffic condition on the road network and explore spatio-temporal knowledge to guide effective route planning. In particular, several effective techniques are employed to avoid both unnecessary calculations on huge graph and excessive re-calculations caused by traffic condition updates. A comprehensive experiment is also conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed strategies."

abstract,"Abstract With the prevalence of GPS-equipped devices and navigation services, users can record and share their driving movements via trajectories. These trajectories reveal users’ driving behaviors for planning routes. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-aware route discovery framework that considers users’ preferred routes. The proposed framework is comprised of two components: pattern-aware road map generation and route planning. In the first component, we mine significant road segments from historical trajectories, and generate a pattern-aware road map. We design a route score function that strikes a balance between user preference degrees and the length of the route. For the second component, given a source, a destination, and a user pre-defined value k, we intend to derive the top-k routes that consist of road segments from the source to the destination in the pattern-aware road map. To support on-line route planning in most navigation services, we propose a constrained breadth-first-search (CBFS) algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our framework using real trajectory data, and compare our framework with an existing approach in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework."

abstract,"Abstract To receive personalized recommendation, users of a location-based service (e.g., a Location-Based Social Network, LBSN) have to provide personal information and preferences to the location-based service. However, detailed personal information could be used to identify the users, and hence compromise user privacy. In this paper, we consider an untrusted third party recommendation service used by the location-based service that may attempt to identify the sender of a recommendation query from the query log or may publish the query log. To protect user identity, anonymization must be done “online” before a query reaches the recommendation service. This is different from the usual “offline” scenario where a trusted recommendation service will receive all unanonymized queries and the focus is to anonymize the collected query log. We propose the notion of online anonymity to formalize this online requirement. The challenge for providing online anonymity is dealing with unknown and dynamic location-based service users who can get online and offline at any time. We define this problem, discuss its implications and differences from the problems in the literature, and propose a solution. Our experimental study shows that it is feasible to achieve personalized recommendation while preserve user privacy."

abstract,"Abstract With proliferation of lightweight mobile devices such as mobile phones and explosion of location-based social networking services, there is a growing demand for matching between geographic locations and road networks on mobile devices. Nonetheless, existing methods for map matching only focus on accuracy and/or efficiency improvement, whereas they seldom take into account the capacity for storing map data and energy consumption during the matching process. This paper presents a method that is specifically designed for lightweight mobile devices with limited storage and computing resources, thereby providing an effective solution for map matching on mobile and embedded environments. Extensive experiments were carried out to compare proposed method against traditional approaches. The results indicate that our method can cut down the storage cost for road networks by 75 % compared to traditional methods, with only 3–5 % extra running time, which demonstrates the practical usefulness and superiority of our proposal in real-world mobile applications."

abstract,"Abstract It has become widely recognized that user feedback can play a fundamental role in facilitating information integration tasks, e.g., the construction of integration schema and the specification of schema mappings. While promising, existing proposals make the assumption that the users providing feedback expect the same results from the integration system. In practice, however, different users may anticipate different results, due, e.g., to their preferences or application of interest, in which case the feedback they provide may be conflicting, thereby deteriorating the quality of the services provided by the integration system. In this paper, we present clustering strategies for grouping information integration users into groups of users with similar expectations as to the results delivered by the integration system. As well as grouping information integration users, we show that clustering results can be used as inputs to a wide range of functionalities that are relevant in the context of crowd-driven information integration. Specifically, we show that clustering can be used to identify feedback of relevance to a given user by exploiting the feedback provided by other users in the same cluster. We report on evaluation exercises that assess the effectiveness of the clustering strategies we propose, and showcase the benefits community- and crowd-driven information integration can derive from clustering."

abstract,"Abstract Social tags take an important role in exploratory search. In collaborative tagging systems, users are allowed to annotate resources with tags. The significant challenges in such systems are the uncertainty of tag quality and the incomplete annotation on a large number of resources. Based on the observation that these problems can be statistically negligible after receiving sufficient tags, we propose a novel incentive mechanism to reward taggers according to the quality of their bookmarks, called the Quality-based dynamic Incentive Mechanism (QIM). To well evaluate the quality of bookmarks, we design some quantitative evaluation methods. The reward allocation function is proposed to allocate the budget to different taggers based on their bookmark quality and the tagging states of annotated resources. We perform experiments to evaluate our method on three public datasets collected from real tagging systems. Comparing with previous works, the adopted principle of “high quality deserves high price” in this paper can encourage users to annotate seriously. The experimental results show that our method gets higher tagging quality of resources under a fixed budget. Moreover, it requires less time and less money to achieve the stable tagging state of a system."

More precisely, we provide a formal description language for specifying digital crowds. We represent digital crowds in which the agents do not directly communicate with each other. We further show how this specification can provide the basis for sophisticated formal methods, in particular formal verification."

Workers are paid for answering simple queries carefully chosen by the system. We present two algorithms: a single worker algorithm (\({\textsc {alf}}_{\eta }\)) and a multiple workers algorithm (alfred). Both the algorithms deal with the inherent uncertainty of the workers’ responses and use an active learning approach to select the most informative queries. alfred estimates the workers’ error rate to decide at runtime how many workers should be recruited to achieve a quality target. The system has been fully implemented and tested: the experimental evaluation conducted with both synthetic workers and real workers recruited on a crowdsourcing platform show that our approach is able to produce accurate wrappers at a low cost, even in presence of workers with a significant error rate."

abstract,"Abstract Online aggregation (OLA) is an attractive sampling-based technology to response aggregation queries by an approximate estimate to the final result, with the confidence interval becomes tighter over time. It has been built into the MapReduce-based cloud system for big data analytics, which allows users to monitor the query progress, and save money by killing the computation early once sufficient accuracy has been obtained. However, there is a serious limitation that restricts the performance of OLA that is the sharing issue of multiple OLA queries processing. Note that, in the original MapReduce paradigm, each query is processed independently without considering the potential sharing opportunities, leading to two major unnecessary additional execution costs: (1) the large redundant I/O cost, and (2) the replicative statistical computation cost. To eliminate such additional execution cost and improve the overall performance, we present online aggregation with two-level sharing strategy in cloud (OATS) based on MapReduce framework in this paper to effectively support online aggregation for large scale concurrent query processing in skewed data distribution. In the first-level sharing, we propose a sample buffer management mechanism to share the sampling opportunities among multiple OLA queries to reduce redundant I/O cost. While in the second-level sharing, we propose a heuristic algorithm (with a good scalability for large input) for the statistical computation to share partial statistics calculation to decrease the number of final aggregation operations, reducing the statistical computation cost. Based on such two-level sharing strategy, we have implemented OATS in Hadoop and conducted an extensive experiments study on the TPC-H benchmark for skewed data distribution. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of OATS."

history,"['2014-12', '2014-06-24']"
abstract,"Abstract The cloud computing is an emerging model in which computing infrastructure resources are provided as a service over the internet. Data owners can outsource their data by remotely storing them in the cloud and enjoy on-demand high quality services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources. However, since data owners and the cloud servers are not in the same trusted domain, the outsourced data may be at risk as the cloud server may no longer be fully trusted. Therefore, data confidentiality, availability and integrity is of critical importance in such a scenario. The data owner encrypts data before storing it on the cloud to ensure data confidentiality. Cloud should let the owners or a trusted third party to check for the integrity of their data storage without demanding a local copy of the data. Owners often replicate their data on the cloud servers across multiple data centers to provide a higher level of scalability, availability, and durability. When the data owners ask the cloud service provider (CSP) to replicate data, they are charged a higher storage fee by the CSP. Therefore, the data owners need to be strongly convinced that the CSP is storing data copies agreed on in the service level contract, and data-updates have been correctly executed on all the remotely stored copies. To deal with such problems, previous multi copy verification schemes either focused on static files or incurred huge update costs in a dynamic file scenario. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-replica provable data possession scheme (DMR-PDP) that while maintaining data confidentiality prevents the CSP from cheating, by maintaining fewer copies than paid for and/or tampering data. In addition, we also extend the scheme to support a basic file versioning system where only the difference between the original file and the updated file is propagated rather than the propagation of operations for privacy reasons. DMR-PDP also supports efficient dynamic operations like block modification, insertion and deletion on replicas over the cloud servers. Through security analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and performs better than some other related ideas published recently."

Previous solutions to MQO, heuristic or genetic based, are not appropriate for the large growing query set situation.

By LSShare, we can efficiently solve the MQO problem in a recurring query set situation in the cloud. Our system has been prototyped in a distributed system built for massive data analysis based on Alibaba’s cloud computing platform (http://www.alibaba.com/).

abstract,"Abstract Highly distributed NoSQL key-value data stores are rapidly becoming the favorite choice for hosting modern web applications. Such platforms rely on data partitioning, replication and relaxed consistency to achieve high levels of performance and scalability. However, these design choices often exhibit a trade-off between latency (i.e., Quality of Service (QoS)) and consistency (i.e., Quality of Data (QoD)). In this work, in addition to latency-based SLAs, we also adopt the application tolerance to data staleness as another requirement determining the end-user satisfaction and our goal is to strike a fine balance between both the QoS and QoD provided to the end-user. Towards achieving that goal, we propose a suite of quality-aware schedulers for efficiently allocating the necessary computational resources between the foreground user-queries and the background system-updates at data store nodes. This suite of schedulers features our proposed Freshness/Tardiness (FIT) mechanism, which introduces a novel selective approach for scheduling the execution of queries and updates. Our experimental results show that FIT provides significant improvements in balancing the trade-off between QoS and QoD under both the state-transfer and operation-transfer update propagation models employed in current key-value data stores."

MapReduce is a popular paradigm that can process large volume data more efficiently, in this paper, we proposed two approaches using MapReduce to deal with this task: Hadoop Join by Map Side Pruning and Hadoop Join by Reduce Side Pruning. Hadoop Join by Map Side Pruning uses the sum of the existence probability to filter out the probabilistic sets directly at the Map task side which have no any chance to be similar with any other probabilistic set. Hadoop Join by Reduce Side Pruning uses probability sum based pruning principle and probability upper bound based pruning principle to reduce the candidate pairs at Reduce task side, it can save the comparison cost. Based on the above approaches, we proposed a hybrid solution that employs both Map-side and Reduce-side pruning methods. Finally we implemented the above approaches on Hadoop-0.20.2 and performed comprehensive experiments to their performance, we also test the speedup ratio compared with the naive method: Block Nested Loop Join. The experiment results show that our approaches have much better performance than that of Block Nested Loop Join and also have good scalability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to try to deal with set similarity join on massive probabilistic data problem using MapReduce paradigm, and the approaches proposed in this paper provide a new way to process the massive probabilistic data."

abstract,"Abstract Parallel processing is essential for large-scale analytics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a well known model for dimensionality reduction in statistical analysis, which requires a demanding number of I/O and CPU operations. In this paper, we study how to compute PCA in parallel. We extend a previous sequential method to a highly parallel algorithm that can compute PCA in one pass on a large data set based on summarization matrices. We also study how to integrate our algorithm with a DBMS; our solution is based on a combination of parallel data set summarization via user-defined aggregations and calling the MKL parallel variant of the LAPACK library to solve Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in RAM. Our algorithm is theoretically shown to achieve linear speedup, linear scalability on data size, quadratic time on dimensionality (but in RAM), spending most of the time on data set summarization, despite the fact that SVD has cubic time complexity on dimensionality. Experiments with large data sets on multicore CPUs show that our solution is much faster than the R statistical package as well as solving PCA with SQL queries. Benchmarking on multicore CPUs and a parallel DBMS running on multiple nodes confirms linear speedup and linear scalability."

abstract,"Abstract Although Web Search Engines index and provide access to huge amounts of documents, user queries typically return only a linear list of hits. While this is often satisfactory for focalized search, it does not provide an exploration or deeper analysis of the results. One way to achieve advanced exploration facilities exploiting the availability of structured (and semantic) data in Web search, is to enrich it with entity mining over the full contents of the search results. Such services provide the users with an initial overview of the information space, allowing them to gradually restrict it until locating the desired hits, even if they are low ranked. This is especially important in areas of professional search such as medical search, patent search, etc. In this paper we consider a general scenario of providing such services as meta-services (that is, layered over systems that support keywords search) without a-priori indexing of the underlying document collection(s). To make such services feasible for large amounts of data we use the MapReduce distributed computation model on a Cloud infrastructure (Amazon EC2). Specifically, we show how the required computational tasks can be factorized and expressed as MapReduce functions. A key contribution of our work is a thorough evaluation of platform configuration and tuning, an aspect that is often disregarded and inadequately addressed in prior work, but crucial for the efficient utilization of resources. Finally we report experimental results about the achieved speedup in various settings."

keyword,"['Role based access control\xa0', 'Privilege delegation\xa0', 'Logic programs\xa0']"
history,"['2014-06', '2013-01-18']"
abstract,"Abstract This paper proposes a logic based framework that extends role based access control systems with dynamic delegation in a decentralised environment. It allows delegation of administrative privileges for both roles and access rights between roles. We have introduced the notion of trust in delegation and have shown how extended logic programs can be used to express and reason about roles and their delegations with trust degrees, roles’ privileges and their propagations, delegation depth as well as conflict resolution. Furthermore, our framework is able to enforce various role constraints such as separation of duties, role composition and cardinality constraints. The implementation of the framework is also discussed. The proposed framework is flexible and provides a sound basis for specifying and evaluating sophisticated role based access control policies in decentralised environments."

abstract,"Abstract The tracking of moving objects consists of two critical operations: location reporting, in which moving objects (or clients) send their locations to centralized servers, and index maintenance, through which centralized servers update the locations of moving objects. In existing location reporting techniques, each moving object reports its locations to servers by utilizing long-distance links such as 3G/4G. Corresponding to this location reporting strategy, servers need to respond to all the location updating requests from individual moving objects. Such techniques suffer from very high communication cost (due to the individual reporting using long-distance links) and high index update I/Os (due to the massive amount of location updating requests). In this paper, we present a novel Group-movement based location Reporting and Indexing (GRI) framework for location reporting (at moving object side) and index maintenance (at server side). In the GRI framework, we introduce a novel location reporting strategy which allows moving objects to report their locations to servers in a group (instead of individually) by aggregating the moving objects that share similar movement patterns through wireless local links (such as WiFi). At the server side, we present a dual-index, Hash-GTPR-tree (H-GTPR), to index objects sharing similar movement patterns. Our experimental results on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our new GRI framework, as well as the location reporting strategy and the H-GTPR tree index technique."

abstract,"Abstract The goal of Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing (PPDP) is to generate a sanitized (i.e. harmless) view of sensitive personal data (e.g. a health survey), to be released to some agencies or simply the public.

In this article, we argue that the trust assumption on the central server is far too strong. We propose Met 𝔸P, a generic fully distributed protocol, to execute various forms of PPDP algorithms on an asymmetric architecture composed of low power secure devices and a powerful but untrusted infrastructure. We show that this protocol is both correct and secure against honest-but-curious or malicious adversaries. Finally, we provide an experimental validation showing that this protocol can support PPDP processes scaling up to nation-wide surveys."

history,"['2014-03', '2013-01-09']"
abstract,"Abstract Privacy is a major concern when users query public online data services. The privacy of millions of people has been jeopardized in numerous user data leakage incidents in many popular online applications. To address the critical problem of personal data leakage through queries, we enable private querying on public data services so that the contents of user queries and any user data are hidden and therefore not revealed to the online service providers. We propose two protocols for private processing of database queries, namely BHE and HHE. The two protocols provide strong query privacy by using Paillier’s homomorphic encryption, and support common database queries such as range and join queries by relying on the bucketization of public data. In contrast to traditional Private Information Retrieval proposals, BHE and HHE only incur one round of client server communication for processing a single query. BHE is a basic private query processing protocol that provides complete query privacy but still incurs expensive computation and communication costs. Built upon BHE, HHE is a hybrid protocol that applies ciphertext computation and communication on a subset of the data, such that this subset not only covers the actual requested data but also resembles some frequent query patterns of common users, thus achieving practical query performance while ensuring adequate privacy levels. By using frequent query patterns and data specific privacy protection, HHE is not vulnerable to the traditional attacks on k-Anonymity that exploit data similarity and skewness. Moreover, HHE consistently protects user query privacy for a sequence of queries in a single query session."

abstract,"Abstract Online social networks have become an essential part of social and work life. They enable users to share, discuss, and create content together with various others. Obviously, not all content is meant to be seen by all. It is extremely important to ensure that content is only shown to those that are approved by the content’s owner so that the owner’s privacy is preserved. Generally, online social networks are promising to preserve privacy through privacy agreements, but still everyday new privacy leakages are taking place. Ideally, online social networks should be able to manage and maintain their agreements through well-founded methods. However, the dynamic nature of the online social networks is making it difficult to keep private information contained.We have developed \(\mathcal{PROTOSS}\), a run time tool for detecting and predicting \(\mathcal{PR}\mathrm{ivacy}\ \mathrm{vi}\mathcal{O}\mathrm{la}\mathcal{T}\mathrm{ions}\ \mathrm{in}\ \mathcal{O}\mathrm{nline}\ \mathcal{S}\mathrm{ocial}\ \mathrm{network}\mathcal{S}\). \(\mathcal{PROTOSS}\) captures relations among users, their privacy agreements with an online social network operator, as well as domain-based semantic information and rules. It uses model checking to detect if relations among the users will result in the violation of privacy agreements. It can further use the semantic information to infer possible violations that have not been specified by the user explicitly. In addition to detection, \(\mathcal{PROTOSS}\) can predict possible future violations by feeding in a hypothetical future world state. Through a running example, we show that \(\mathcal{PROTOSS}\) can detect and predict subtle leakages, similar to the ones reported in real life examples. We study the performance of our system on the scenario as well as on an existing Facebook dataset."

Mass on-board storage requires efficient embedded database techniques. These techniques are however very challenging to design due to a combination of conflicting NAND Flash constraints and scarce RAM constraint, disqualifying known state of the art solutions. To tackle this challenge, we proposes a log-only based storage organization and an appropriate indexing scheme, which (1) produce only sequential writes compatible with the Flash constraints and (2) consume a tiny amount of RAM, independent of the database size. We show the effectiveness of this approach through a comprehensive performance study."

history,"['2014-03', '2013-08-27']"
abstract,"Abstract This paper presents a delay-tolerant mix-zone framework for protecting the location privacy of mobile users against continuous query correlation attacks. First, we describe and analyze the continuous query correlation attacks (CQ-attacks) that perform query correlation based inference to break the anonymity of road network-aware mix-zones. We formally study the privacy strengths of the mix-zone anonymization under the CQ-attack model and argue that spatial cloaking or temporal cloaking over road network mix-zones is ineffective and susceptible to attacks that carry out inference by combining query correlation with timing correlation (CQ-timing attack) and transition correlation (CQ-transition attack) information. Next, we introduce three types of delay-tolerant road network mix-zones (i.e., temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal) that are free from CQ-timing and CQ-transition attacks and in contrast to conventional mix-zones, perform a combination of both location mixing and identity mixing of spatially and temporally perturbed user locations to achieve stronger anonymity under the CQ-attack model. We show that by combining temporal and spatial delay-tolerant mix-zones, we can obtain the strongest anonymity for continuous queries while making acceptable tradeoff between anonymous query processing cost and temporal delay incurred in anonymous query processing. We evaluate the proposed techniques through extensive experiments conducted on realistic traces produced by GTMobiSim on different scales of geographic maps. Our experiments show that the proposed techniques offer high level of anonymity and attack resilience to continuous queries."

In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-keyword search scheme that ensures users’ privacy against both external adversaries including other authorized users and cloud server itself. The proposed scheme uses cryptographic techniques as well as query and response randomization. Provided that the security and randomization parameters are appropriately chosen, both search terms in queries and returned responses are protected against privacy violations. The scheme implements strict security and privacy requirements that essentially disallow linking queries featuring identical search terms. We also incorporate an effective ranking capability in the scheme that enables user to retrieve only the top matching results. Our comprehensive analytical study and extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme is privacy-preserving, effective, and highly efficient."

abstract,"Abstract It is often necessary for organizations to perform data mining tasks collaboratively without giving up their own data. This necessity has led to the development of privacy preserving distributed data mining. Several protocols exist which deal with data mining methods in a distributed scenario but most of these methods handle a single data mining task. Therefore, if the participating parties are interested in more than one classification methods they will have to go through a series of distributed protocols every time, thus increasing the overhead substantially. A second significant drawback with existing methods is that they are often quite expensive due to the use of encryption operations. In this paper a method has been proposed that addresses both these issues and provides a generic approach to efficient privacy preserving classification analysis in a distributed setting with a worst-case privacy guarantee. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method."

abstract,"Abstract Distributed data stream processing is a data analysis paradigm where massive amounts of data produced by various sources are analyzed online within real-time constraints. Execution performance of a stream program/query executed on such middleware is largely dependent on the ability of the programmer to fine tune the program to match the topology of the stream processing system. However, manual fine tuning of a stream program is a very difficult, error prone process that demands huge amounts of programmer time and expertise which are expensive to obtain. We describe an automated process for stream program performance optimization that uses semantic preserving automatic code transformation to improve stream processing job performance. We first identify the structure of the input program and represent the program structure in a Directed Acyclic Graph. We transform the graph using the concepts of Tri-OP Transformation and Bi-Op Transformation. The resulting sample program space is pruned using both empirical as well as profiling information to obtain a ranked list of sample programs which have higher performance compared to their parent program. We successfully implemented this methodology on a prototype stream program performance optimization mechanism called Hirundo. The mechanism has been developed for optimizing SPADE programs which run on System S stream processing run-time. Using five real world applications (called VWAP, CDR, Twitter, Apnoea, and Bargain) we show the effectiveness of our approach. Hirundo was able to identify a 31.1 times higher performance version of the CDR application within seven minutes time on a cluster of 4 nodes."

abstract,"Abstract The practical relevance of process mining is increasing as more and more event data become available. Process mining techniques aim to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs. The two most prominent process mining tasks are: (i) process discovery: learning a process model from example behavior recorded in an event log, and (ii) conformance checking: diagnosing and quantifying discrepancies between observed behavior and modeled behavior. The increasing volume of event data provides both opportunities and challenges for process mining. Existing process mining techniques have problems dealing with large event logs referring to many different activities. Therefore, we propose a generic approach to decompose process mining problems. The decomposition approach is generic and can be combined with different existing process discovery and conformance checking techniques. It is possible to split computationally challenging process mining problems into many smaller problems that can be analyzed easily and whose results can be combined into solutions for the original problems."

In this paper, we present FD (Fully Distributed), a decentralized algorithm for dealing with the ERPD problem over distributed data, with the goal of minimizing bandwidth usage and reducing processing time. FD is completely distributed and does not depend on the existence of certain nodes. We validated FD through implementation over a 75-node cluster and simulation using the PeerSim simulator. We used both synthetic and real-world data in our experiments. Our performance evaluation shows that FD can achieve major performance gains in terms of bandwidth usage and response time."

abstract,"Abstract In a distributed database, maintaining large table replicas with frequent asynchronous insertions is a challenging problem that requires carefully managing a tradeoff between consistency and availability. With that motivation in mind, we propose efficient algorithms to repair and measure replica consistency. Specifically, we adapt, extend and optimize distributed set reconciliation algorithms to efficiently compute the symmetric difference between replicated tables in a distributed relational database. Our novel algorithms enable fast synchronization of replicas being updated with small sets of new records, measuring obsolence of replicas having many insertions and deciding when to update a replica, as each table replica is being continuously updated in an asynchronous manner. We first present an algorithm to repair and measure distributed consistency on a large table continuously updated with new records at several sites when the number of insertions is small. We then present a complementary algorithm that enables fast synchronization of a summarization table based on foreign keys when the number of insertions is large, but happening on a few foreign key values. From a distributed systems perspective, in the first algorithm the large table with data is reconciled, whereas in the second case, its summarization table is reconciled. Both distributed database algorithms have linear communication complexity and cubic time complexity in the size of the symmetric difference between the respective table replicas they work on. That is, they are effective when the network speed is smaller than CPU speed at each site. A performance experimental evaluation with synthetic and real databases shows our algorithms are faster than a previous state-of-the art algorithm as well as more efficient than transferring complete tables, assuming large replicated tables and sporadic asynchronous insertions."

abstract,"Abstract The main requirements for spatial query processing via mobile terminals include rapid and accurate searching and low energy consumption. Most location-based services (LBSs) are provided using an on-demand method, which is suitable for light-loaded systems where contention for wireless channels and server processing is not severe. However, as the number of users of LBSs increases, performance deteriorates rapidly since the servers’ capability to process queries is limited. Furthermore, the response time of a query may significantly increase with the concentration of users’ queries in a server at the same time. That is because the server has to check the locations of users and potential objects for the final result and then individually send answers to clients via a point-to-point channel. At this time, an inefficient structure of spatial index and searching algorithm may incur an extremely large access latency.To address this problem, we propose the Hierarchical Grid Index (HGI), which provides a light-weight sequential location-based index structure for efficient LBSs. We minimize the index size through the use of hierarchical location-based identifications. And we support efficient query processing in broadcasting environments through sequential data transfer and search based on the object locations. We also propose Top-Down Search and Reduction-Counter Search algorithms for efficient searching and query processing. HGI has a simple structure through elimination of replication pointers and is therefore suitable for broadcasting environments with one-dimensional characteristics, thus enabling rapid and accurate spatial search by reducing redundant data. Our performance evaluation shows that our proposed index and algorithms are accurate and fast and support efficient spatial query processing."

We discuss data-driven, statistical approaches for both, instance-level prediction (SLA compliance prediction for an ongoing business process instance) and forecasting (compliance prediction for future instances).

history,"['2013-06', '2012-09-05']"
abstract,"Abstract The ubiquity of location enabled devices has resulted in a wide proliferation of location based applications and services. To handle the growing scale, database management systems driving such location based services (LBS) must cope with high insert rates for location updates of millions of devices, while supporting efficient real-time analysis on latest location. Traditional DBMSs, equipped with multi-dimensional index structures, can efficiently handle spatio-temporal data. However, popular open-source relational database systems are overwhelmed by the high insertion rates, real-time querying requirements, and terabytes of data that these systems must handle. On the other hand, key-value stores can effectively support large scale operation, but do not natively provide multi-attribute accesses needed to support the rich querying functionality essential for the LBSs.We present the design and implementation of \(\mathcal {MD}\) -HBase, a scalable data management infrastructure for LBSs that bridges this gap between scale and functionality. Our approach leverages a multi-dimensional index structure layered over a key-value store. The underlying key-value store allows the system to sustain high insert throughput and large data volumes, while ensuring fault-tolerance, and high availability. On the other hand, the index layer allows efficient multi-dimensional query processing. Our optimized query processing technique accesses only the index and storage level entries that intersect with the query region, thus ensuring efficient query processing. We present the design of \(\mathcal {MD}\)-HBase that demonstrates how two standard index structures—the K-d tree and the Quad tree—can be layered over a range partitioned key-value store to provide scalable multi-dimensional data infrastructure. Our prototype implementation using HBase, a standard open-source key-value store, can handle hundreds of thousands of inserts per second using a modest 16 node cluster, while efficiently processing multi-dimensional range queries and nearest neighbor queries in real-time with response times as low as few hundreds of milliseconds."

abstract,"Abstract A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of mobile, wireless and battery-powered nodes without any fixed infrastructure. Therefore, it fits well in mission-critical applications such as disaster rescue and military operations. However, when a node runs out of energy, communication may fail and transactions may be aborted if they are time-critical and miss their deadlines. In order to provide timely and correct results for multiple concurrent transactions, energy-efficient database concurrency control (CC) techniques become critical for database systems built for MANET. Due to the characteristics of MANET databases, existing CC algorithms cannot work effectively. In this paper, an energy-efficient CC algorithm is developed for mission-critical MANET databases in a clustered network architecture where nodes are divided into clusters, each of which has a cluster head, responsible for the processing of all nodes in the cluster. The cluster structure is constructed using a novel weighted clustering algorithm, which uses node mobility, remaining energy and workload to group nodes into clusters and select cluster heads. In our CC algorithm, we elect cluster heads to work as coordinating servers to conserve energy and balance energy consumption among servers, and propose an optimistic CC algorithm to offer high concurrency and avoid wasting limited system resources. Besides correctness proof and theoretical analysis, comprehensive simulation experiments were conducted, and simulation results show the superiority of our CC algorithm over existing techniques in terms of transaction abort rate, total energy consumption by all servers, and degree of balancing energy consumption among servers."

In this paper, we present a distributed search architecture for intelligent search of objects in a mobile social community. Our framework, coined SmartOpt, is founded on an in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on smartphones and searches then take place over an intelligent multi-objective lookup structure we compute dynamically. Our MO-QRT structure optimizes several conflicting objectives, using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that calculates a diverse set of high quality non-dominated solutions in a single run. Then a decision-making subsystem is utilized to tune the retrieval preferences of the query user. We assess our ideas both using trace-driven experiments with mobility and social patterns derived by Microsoft’s GeoLife project, DBLP and Pics ‘n’ Trails but also using our real Android SmartP2P (http://smartp2p.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) system deployed over our SmartLab (http://smartlab.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) testbed of 40+ smartphones.

abstract,"Abstract Location prediction is a crucial need for location-aware services and applications. Given an object’s recent movement and a future time, the goal of location prediction is to predict the location of the object at the future time specified. Different from traditional location prediction using motion function, some research works have elaborated on mining movement behavior from historical trajectories for location prediction. Without loss of generality, given a set of trajectories of an object, prior works on mining movement behaviors will first extract regions of popularity, in which the object frequently appears, and then discover the sequential relationships among regions. However, the quality of the frequent regions extracted affects the accuracy of the location prediction. Furthermore, trajectory data has both spatial and temporal information. To further enhance the accuracy of location prediction, one could utilize not only spatial information but also temporal information to predict the locations of objects. In this paper, we propose a framework QS-STT (standing for QuadSection clustering and Spatial-Temporal Trajectory model) to capture the movement behaviors of objects for location prediction. Specifically, we have developed QuadSection clustering to extract a reasonable and near-optimal set of frequent regions. Then, based on the set of frequent regions, we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory model to explore the object’s movement behavior as a probabilistic suffix tree with both spatial and temporal information of movements. Note that STT is not only able to discover sequential relationships among regions but also derives the corresponding probabilities of time, indicating when the object appears in each region. Based on STT, we further propose an algorithm to traverse STT for location prediction. By enhancing the quality of the frequent region extracted and exploring both the spatial and temporal information of STT, the accuracy of location prediction in QS-STT is improved. QS-STT is designed for individual location prediction. For verifying the effectiveness of QS-STT for location prediction under the different spatial density, we have conducted experiments on four types of real trajectory datasets with different speed. The experimental results show that our proposed QS-STT is able to capture both spatial and temporal patterns of movement behaviors and by exploring QS-STT, our proposed prediction algorithm outperforms existing works."

abstract,"Abstract The k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) query is one of the most popular spatial query types for location-based services (LBS). In this paper, we focus on k-NN queries in time-dependent road networks, where the travel time between two locations may vary significantly at different time of the day. In practice, it is costly for a LBS provider to collect real-time traffic data from vehicles or roadside sensors to compute the best route from a user to a spatial object of interest in terms of the travel time. Thus, we design SMashQ, a server-side spatial mashup framework that enables a database server to efficiently evaluate k-NN queries using the route information and travel time accessed from an external Web mapping service, e.g., Microsoft Bing Maps. Due to the expensive cost and limitations of retrieving such external information, we propose three shared execution optimizations for SMashQ, namely, object grouping, direction sharing, and user grouping, to reduce the number of external Web mapping requests and provide highly accurate query answers. We evaluate SMashQ using Microsoft Bing Maps, a real road network, real data sets, and a synthetic data set. Experimental results show that SMashQ is efficient and capable of producing highly accurate query answers."

ACQUA replaces the current paradigm, where the data is typically streamed (pushed) from the sensors to the one or more smartphones, with a pull-based asynchronous model, where a smartphone retrieves appropriate blocks of relevant sensor data from individual sensors, as an integral part of the query evaluation process. We describe algorithms that dynamically optimize the sequence (for complex stream queries with conjunctive and disjunctive predicates) in which such sensor data streams are retrieved by the query evaluation component, based on a combination of (a) the communication cost & selectivity properties of individual sensor streams, and (b) the occurrence of the stream predicates in multiple concurrently executing queries. We also show how a transformation of a group of stream queries into a disjunctive normal form provides us with significantly greater degrees of freedom in choosing this sequence, in which individual sensor streams are retrieved and evaluated. While the algorithms can apply to a broad category of sensor-based applications, we specifically demonstrate their application to a scenario where multiple stream processing queries execute on a single smartphone, with the sensors transferring their data over an appropriate PAN technology, such as Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that ACQUA’s intelligent batch-oriented data acquisition process can result in as much as 80 % reduction in the energy overhead of continuous query processing, without any loss in the fidelity of the processing logic."

abstract,"Abstract Due to lack of pre-deployed infrastructure, nodes in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are required to relay data packets for other nodes to enable multi-hop communication between nodes that are not in the radio range with each other. However, whether for selfish or malicious purposes, a node may refuse to cooperate during the network operations or even attempt to interrupt them, both of which have been recognized as misbehaviors. Significant research efforts have been made to address the problem of detecting misbehaviors. However, little research work has been done to distinguish truly malicious behaviors from the faulty behaviors. Both the malicious behaviors and the faulty behaviors are generally equally treated as misbehaviors without any further investigation by most of the traditional misbehavior detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose and study a Context-Aware Security and Trust framework (CAST) for MANETs, in which various contextual information, such as communication channel status, battery status, and weather condition, are collected and then used to determine whether the misbehavior is likely a result of malicious activity or not. Simulation results illustrate that the CAST framework is able to accurately distinguish malicious nodes from faulty nodes with a limited overhead."

abstract,"Abstract In process-driven, service-oriented architectures (SOAs), process activities can perform service operations, data transformations, or human tasks. Unfortunately, the process activities are usually tightly coupled. Thus, when the number of activities in the process grows, focusing on particular activities of the flow such as the service operations reading or writing persistent data is a time-consuming task. In particular, in order to solve structural problems concerning persistent data access such as deadlocks in data-intensive business processes, stakeholders need to understand the underlying persistent data access details of the activities i.e. physical storage schemes, and database connections.With our view-based model-driven approach, we provide a solution to generate flows of persistent data access activities (which we refer to as persistent data access flows). To the best of our knowledge these persistent data access flows are not used to solve structural problems in process-driven SOAs, yet. Moreover, our persistent data access flows can be flattened by diverse filer criteria e.g. by filtering all activities reading or writing from a specific database or table. Using our approach, we can enhance traceability and documentation of persistent data access in business processes. In a series of motivating scenarios from an industrial case study we present how our persistent data access flow concept can contribute to enhance productivity in service-oriented, process-driven environments. We qualitatively evaluate our concepts and prototypes, and finally, discuss the correctness and the complexity of the underlying algorithms."

abstract,"Abstract We focus on range query processing on large-scale, typically distributed infrastructures, such as clouds of thousands of nodes of shared-datacenters, of p2p distributed overlays, etc. In such distributed environments, efficient range query processing is the key for managing the distributed data sets per se, and for monitoring the infrastructure’s resources. We wish to develop an architecture that can support range queries in such large-scale decentralized environments and can scale in terms of the number of nodes as well as in terms of the data items stored. Of course, in the last few years there have been a number of solutions (mostly from researchers in the p2p domain) for designing such large-scale systems. However, these are inadequate for our purposes, since at the envisaged scales the classic logarithmic complexity (for point queries) is still too expensive while for range queries it is even more disappointing. In this paper we go one step further and achieve a sub-logarithmic complexity. We contribute the ART (Autonomous Range Tree) structure, which outperforms the most popular decentralized structures, including Chord (and some of its successors), BATON (and its successor) and Skip-Graphs. We contribute theoretical analysis, backed up by detailed experimental results, showing that the communication cost of query and update operations is \(O(\log_{b}^{2} \log N)\) hops, where the base b is a double-exponentially power of two and N is the total number of nodes. Moreover, ART is a fully dynamic and fault-tolerant structure, which supports the join/leave node operations in O(loglogN) expected w.h.p. number of hops. Our experimental performance studies include a detailed performance comparison which showcases the improved performance, scalability, and robustness of ART."

history,"['2013-03', '2012-08-16']"
abstract,"Abstract The emergence of the deep Web has given a new connotation to the concept of ranking database query results. Earlier approaches for ranking either resorted to analyzing frequencies of database values and query logs or establishing user profiles. In contrast, an integrated approach, based on the notion of a similarity model, for holistically supporting user- and query-dependent ranking has been recently proposed (Telang et al. in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), 2011). An important component of this framework is a workload consisting of ranking functions, wherein each function represents an individual user’s preferences towards the results of a specific query. At the time of answering a query for which no prior ranking function exists, the similarity model is employed, and is expected to ensure a good quality of ranking as long as a ranking function for a very similar user-query pair exists in this workload.In this paper, we address the problem of determining an appropriate set of user-query pairs to form a workload of ranking functions to support user- and query-dependent ranking for Web databases. We propose a novel metric, termed workload goodness, that quantifies the notion of a “good” workload into an absolute value. The process of finding such a workload of optimal goodness is a combinatorially explosive problem; therefore, we propose a heuristic solution, and advance three approaches for determining an acceptable workload, in a static as well as a dynamic environment. We discuss the effectiveness of our proposal analytically as well as experimentally over two Web databases."

history,"['2012-10', '2012-08-08']"
abstract,"Abstract In distributed scientific query processing systems, leveraging distributed cached data is becoming more important. In such systems, a front-end query scheduler distributes queries among many application servers rather than processing queries in a few high-performance workstations. Although many query scheduling policies exist such as round-robin and load-monitoring, they are not sophisticated enough to exploit cached results as well as balance the workload. Efforts were made to improve the query processing performance using statistical methods such as exponential moving average. However, existing methods have limitations for certain query patterns: queries with hotspots, or dynamic query distributions. In this paper, we propose novel query scheduling policies that take into account both the contents of distributed caching infrastructure and the load balance among the servers. Our experiments show that the proposed query scheduling policies outperform existing policies by producing better query plans in terms of load balance and cache-hit ratio."

Total time taken, rate of glove perforation, intraoperative and postoperative complications were noted in both the groups.Results The time taken for maxillomandibular fixation in minutes and rate of glove perforation was found to be statistically significantly less for transalveolar group compared to arch bar group (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference found in the oral hygiene and gingival status using the Glass index and Gingival index. The rate of screw breakage (04.67%), wire breakage (05.12%), non-vitality due to iatrogenic dental damage (01.66%), soft tissue injury and tooth loss were some of the noted complications during the study.ConclusionWe found that transalveolar group offered advantages like less time taken with a definite decreased risk of percutaneous injury, while the iatrogenic complications like dental damage can be reduced by taking adequate precautions."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeTo determine whether retention or removal of teeth in line of mandibular fractures affects the incidence of postoperative complications. To evaluate the fate of teeth retained in mandibular fractures based on location of fracture line in relation to apical foramen and lateral periodontium of retained tooth.Method51 mandibular fracture sites in 39 patients were treated by open reduction and internal fixation using miniplates. Teeth in line of fracture were removed if showed extensive caries, excessive mobility of tooth, or root fracture. Accordingly patients were divided into two groups, group I tooth removed (15 sites) and group II tooth retained (36 sites). Teeth retained in fracture line were classified based on position of the fracture in relation to apical foramen and the lateral periodontium of involved tooth estimated from preoperative panoramic radiograph into four types. Postoperative periodic follow up done for 1 year and seen for incidence of postoperative complications and fate of tooth in line of fracture.Results Out of 36 fracture sites in which teeth were retained 5 (13.89%) showed postoperative complications, and out of 15 fracture sites in which teeth were removed 3 (20%) showed postoperative complications. Out of 36 fracture sites in which tooth was retained we found in 3 cases fracture line passed through 2 adjacent teeth. Thus we had in total 39 teeth in fracture line out of them 26 required no treatment 9 required endodontic treatment and 4 teeth required extraction. Need for extraction and endodontic treatment was found more in type I and type III relation.ConclusionThere is an increased risk for postoperative complications when a tooth is removed, although it is not statistically significant. Evaluation of fate of retained teeth showed better prognosis of teeth in type II cases than type III and type I cases. Results  of this study leads to conclusions that teeth associated with mandibular fractures need not be removed on prophylactic basis."

Facial anthropometric measurement is considered an essential concern of surgeons, orthodontists, artists and forensic scientists. The aim of this study is to investigate facial anthropometric norms of the young Iranian population.Methods The study participants consisted of 200 healthy Iranian students (100 males, 100 females) aged 18–25 years old. Twenty-three liner and four angular measurements were investigated twice by a dentist. Independent-samples t test was used to compare indices between males and females and also between countries. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results It was found that the mean measurements of c’–sn’ of both sides, nasolabial angle, trichion–gnathion, tragion–tragion and gnathion–gnathion were statistically greater in Iranian males than in females (p < 0.05). Comparing Iranian anthropometric norms with North American Whites, Malays, Turkish and African American women demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences in most anthropometric measurements between Iranians and other populations (p < 0.05).ConclusionIn Iranians, mean measurements of c’–sn’ of the right and left sides, nasolabial angle, trichion–gnathion, tragion–tragion and gnathion–gnathion were greater in men than in women. Comparing Iranian males and females with different ethnicities indicated several interracial differences, which should be taken into consideration when dealing with patients or also practitioners originated in this region."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionOral submucosal fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic debilitating fibrotic disease of the oral cavity and is a serious health hazard in south Asia and, increasingly, the rest of the world. The molecular basis behind various treatment modalities to treat OSMF still remains unclear. In this study, we have investigated the in vitro ability of the buccal mucosal cells to reduce the proliferation of the fibroblasts of the fibrotic area in co-culture of cells and also at the molecular levels to reduce the level of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the OSMF fibroblasts (SMF-F).
Materials and Methods The study compares isolation, morphological and proliferation kinetics of SMF-F and BMF cells with and without co-culturing with BMEs. In addition, we have compared the mRNA expression levels of CTGF in SMF-F co-cultured BME and non-co-cultured SMF-F cells using validated real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method.Results The basic morphological characteristics of SMF-F were similar to BMF, but the former cells had higher proliferation rate in early passages compared to late passage state. We also observed that the CTGF expression levels in SMF-F under co-culture conditions of BME were consistently and significantly downregulated in all four different SMF-F-derived cells from four different patients.ConclusionRapid proliferation and collagen synthesis in SMF-F as against BMF cells are the factors that confirm the innate nature of fibrosis fibroblasts (SMF-F). Further, the CTGF expression level in SMF-F was significantly suppressed by BME in co-culture conditions against controls (BMF). Considered together, this suggests that the cell therapeutic candidate of BME could be used in treating OSMF."

Immediate pre-operative, 6 months postoperative, and 2 years postoperative lateral cephalograms were compiled and assessed.Results The mean surgical advancement planned was around 8 mm. Six months post-surgery, the relapse rate was 15% of the surgical advancement which was considerably reduced in the following 18 months to 7%.

The tongue flap is an extremely versatile, sturdy, reliable and efficient means of closure of anterior as well as posterior, unilateral and bilateral palatal defects, effectively functionally obliterating the oronasal communication, owing much of its success to its highly vascular structure, good mobility, texture match, central location and low donor site morbidity. However, it has a few drawbacks. Flap dehiscence and detachment during the early postoperative period is a troublesome complication owing to tongue movements during normal activities such as speaking, swallowing, yawning and coughing.AimThis article describes some of the methods which can be used to effectively alleviate these shortcomings.Methods A protocol of  immobilizing the tongue by tethering it to the maxillary teeth for the 3-week postoperative period, and also maintaining the patient on nasogastric feeding, until the patient is taken up for surgical separation the pedicle, was employed in all patients in this case series.Results There was a successful and predictable take of the tongue flap at the donor site, namely the palatal/oronasal fistula with its successful closure, in all the patients.ConclusionTreatment of the oronasal fistula using a two-layer closure using the nasal mucoperiosteum together with an anteriorly based dorsal tongue flap is an easy and efficient method, whose reliability can be further increased by avoiding a common complication, namely tongue flap detachment in the postoperative period brought on by movements of the tongue, by immobilizing the tongue by tethering it to the maxillary teeth and also maintaining the patient on nasogastric feeding for the 3-week postoperative period."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and clinical acceptability of the local anaesthetic agent ropivacaine 0.75 % in comparison with lignocaine 2 % with adrenaline 1:200,000 in minor oral surgical procedures.Methods Forty-seven patients, who required bilateral extractions in a single arch, were included in this study. One hundred and sixty-six extractions were performed and all the patients were administered nerve blocks/infiltration. Pre and postoperative pulse, blood pressure, random blood sugar, electrocardiogram and partial oxygen pressure were recorded at specified time intervals. Pain score by visual analogue scale, onset of action and depth of anesthesia were also observed. Duration of anaesthesia was assessed by feeling of numbness and first sign of pain.Results Statistical analysis revealed insignificant difference between both the groups in terms of pulse, blood pressure, random blood sugar, and partial oxygen pressure. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated by pain, comfort during the procedure with visual analog scale and showed no significant difference between the two groups. The onset of action for maxillary infiltration was 33.29 ± 9.2 (ropivacaine), 32.12 ± 6.8 s (2 % lignocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000) and for pterygomandibular nerve block was 181.0 ± 87.5 (ropivacaine), 32.12 ± 6.8 s (2 % lignocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000). Duration of anesthesia when compared was 411.7 ± 66.11 min (ropivacaine) and 107.87 ± 16.54 (2 % lignocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000). On maxillary buccal vestibule infiltration it was also observed that in ropivacaine group there was no requirement of palatal infiltration suggestive of good diffusion property.ConclusionRopivacaine is a safe, clinically acceptable long acting local anaesthetic agent with added advantage of effective diffusion property.Ethical Committee Approval NumberSDC/MISC/2013/239."

abstract,"Abstract ObjectivesPre-operative radiographic evaluation of impacted mandibular third molar and inferior alveolar canal (IAC) is important in preventing a possible nerve exposure and damage during surgical removal. The present study analysed the relation of the mandibular third molar with inferior alveolar canal using panoramic radiography (PAN) and cone beam CT (CBCT) and evaluated the radiographic features suggestive of IAN exposure and post-operative paresthesia.Materials and Methods PAN and CBCT findings of 53 impacted mandibular third molars having a close relation with IAC undergoing extraction were analysed. Further, all cases were evaluated for any sensory loss in relation to IAN 1 week post-operatively.Results The most common PAN feature was combination of darkening of roots (DR) and interruption of white line (IWL), seen in 35.86% (19) cases. The most common CBCT feature was thinning of lingual cortex in 81.14% (43) cases. The most common location of IAC in CBCT was inferior in 47.16% (25) cases, followed by buccal 26.41% (14). On comparison of PAN and CBCT findings, DR and IWL both exclusively 92.86% (13); 80% (12) cases and in combination 75% (15) were most commonly associated with thinning of lingual cortex. IAN exposure was seen in 7.55% (4) cases, and 3.77% (2) cases reported with paresthesia. Absence of corticalisation and IWL was associated with all cases of nerve exposure, inter-radicular location of IAC seen in three out of the four cases. Cases with paresthesia had DR and deflection of roots (DEFR) with thinning of lingual cortex by roots.ConclusionDR with DEFR or IWL in PAN as combination and inter-radicular location of IAC with thinning of lingual cortex by root tips in CBCT are highly predictive of nerve exposure and subsequent paresthesia."

abstract,"Abstract Background Serratiopeptidase for pain, facial swelling and trismus associated with surgical removal of impacted molar is under investigation. However conclusive evidence on the use of serratiopeptidase is lacking. Hence a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies was carried out.
Methods Electronic databases were searched for eligible studies and necessary data extracted. The data were analysed using non-Cochrane mode in RevMan 5.0. 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to represent the deviation from the point estimate. The heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using Forest plot visually, I2 statistics and Chi square test with a statistical P value of <0.10 to indicate statistical significance. Random-effect models were used in case of moderate to severe heterogeneity.Results Five studies were included for final review. Serratiopeptidase improved trismus better than corticosteroids with the MD, 95% as 4.42 [3.84, 5]. As regards to swelling, no significant difference was observed for serratiopeptidase when compared to corticosteroids. Paucity of studies precludes any conclusion for other outcome measures as well as for other comparator drugs.ConclusionSerratiopeptidase could be used safely and effectively to improve trismus and facial swelling after surgical removal of impacted molar."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeBulimia is a common cause of sialadenosis. This paper presents a case of bilateral parotid sialadenosis associated with long-standing bulimia, and reviews the relevant literature and current treatment options.Methods  and Results A 32-year-old woman had severe bilateral parotid sialomegaly for the last 6 years, which had occurred secondary to bulimia nervosa, which she had since 14 years. Treatment with pilocarpine was unsuccessful, so she underwent bilateral conservative parotidectomy. This procedure not only improved the aesthetic appearance of the patient but also improved her social and work life and overall quality of life.Conclusions Sialomegaly secondary to bulimia results in a major alteration of the aesthetics of a patient’s face. Conservative measures are not enough in many cases, and parotidectomy may be the only viable option, as it can also significantly improve adherence to psychiatric treatment for bulimia, in addition to correcting the facial aesthetics."

abstract,"Abstract The prevention of scar contracture after surgery is an important aspect of lateral facial cleft repair. Maintaining adequate mouth opening is essential for speech, expression, chewing, oral hygiene and psychosocial well-being. Although there have been extensive reviews of non-surgical microstomia management in patients with oral electrical burns, there have been no reports on the use of oral commissure splints to manage the surgical scar in patients with lateral facial clefts. The case study presented here will demonstrate the clinical use of cheek retractors to provide physical resistance to scar contracture. We recommend early rehabilitation with cheek retractors to minimize scar contracture and the negative sequelae of scarred tissues on the dentition after lateral facial cleft repair."

abstract,"Abstract ObjectiveArthroscopy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) has become a well-standardized non-invasive procedure for the treatment of TMJ internal derangement (ID). Since the last 1980s, no clinical application for arthroscopy of the inferior compartment has been established because of the intrinsic difficulty of the technique and the believing of the absence of clinical relevance for treatment of ID.
Methods We report on a particular case in which arthroscopy of the inferior joint compartment together with the examination of the upper joint space was performed in a patient with ID of the TMJ. A 1.9 mm scope was used, while the technique for entering the inferior compartment is presented.Results The presence of intense synovitis, fibrous adhesion, and pseudowall were observed in the inferior joint compartment, thus leading to the hypothesis of the more than likely influence of the status of the synovial lining within this space in the persistence of symptoms in recalcitrant patients with ID.ConclusionWe believe that this new insight could lead surgeons to a more complete use of this non-invasive procedure for the treatment of this entity.Level of Evidence4/5."

abstract,"Abstract Management of orbital floor fracture remains the most debated topic in maxillofacial field. There are many approaches to reconstruct orbital floor fractures and restore orbital position and function, but many have the drawback of incomplete visualization, especially of the posterior part of the orbit. Pain, diplopia and enophthalmos are the most common presenting symptoms in patients who sustained orbital blow out fracture. The main aim in treating orbital fracture is to reduce the prolapsed orbital tissue and reconstruct the floor which will improve diplopia and enophthalmos. As minimally invasive surgical techniques are gaining popularity, it is possible to reconstruct the orbital fracture defects using endoscopes. Endoscopic assisted combined transantral and subciliary technique provides better surgical access and outcome in the treatment of orbital floor fracture."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeThe aim of this meta-analysis was to determine which characteristics of mandibular third molars (MTMs) are more often associated with an increase in the prevalence/incidence of caries on the distal surface of mandibular second molars (MSMs).Methods Three electronic databases were analyzed: PubMed; OVID and the Virtual Health Library. Observational studies were included, and the risk of bias was assessed using The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software program was used for meta-analysis.Results Fifteen studies were included in this systematic review, and five were included in the meta-analysis. The distal surface of MSMs were more likely to exhibit caries in the following scenarios: when MTMs were found in the A position, rather than the C position (OR: 3.45, 95% CI: 2.28-5.22, p<0.001); when the horizontal position was compared with the vertical (OR: 8.12, 95% CI: 3.75-17.58, p<0.001) and distoangular (OR: 9.75, 95% CI: 3.49 – 27.25, p<0.001) positions; and when the mesioangular position was compared with the vertical (OR: 7.25, 95% CI: 3.48-15.10, p<0.001) and distoangular (OR: 9.54, 95% CI: 3.47 – 26.21, p<0.001) positions.ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that the presence of MTMs increases the incidence of caries on the distal surface of MSMs. Furthermore, caries on the distal surface of MSMs is more commonly associated with position A and horizontal and mesioangular mandibular molars."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionOf the many chronic painful conditions, trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affecting the orofacial region needs the particular attention of physicians and surgeons, especially those specialising in the maxillofacial region. Treatment protocols for the management of classic TN include pharmacology and surgical intervention. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons have traditionally employed the peripheral neurectomy in the surgical management of TN. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of peripheral neurectomy in the management of TN with regard to (a) the relief of symptoms in comparison with standard neurosurgical procedures and (b) the duration of pain relief and complications observed compared to standard neurosurgical procedures.Methods The review of the literature was done according to PRISMA guidelines and included randomised controlled trials, reviews and prospective clinical studies involving surgical procedures for the management of TN. The primary outcomes evaluated were (a) initial relief of pain, (b) duration of relief of pain, (c) complications observed with ablative procedures and (d) recurrence of symptoms. A total of 43 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria.Results In a total of 7913 patients from the 43 studies, central procedures were found to have best results for both quality and duration of pain relief. Percutaneous and peripheral procedures were associated with increased recurrence rates. The consolidated rates of complication for peripheral, percutaneous and central procedures were 39.46, 65.42 and 10.41%, respectively. The use of peripheral neurectomy alone in the management of classic TN was observed in 10 studies.ConclusionPeripheral neurectomy in TN is associated with lesser quality of pain relief in comparison with central neurosurgical procedures. It also provides only short- to medium-term pain relief. Most studies with the use of peripheral neurectomy involved only a small group of patients with short follow-up periods. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must not consider the peripheral neurectomy as the first surgical option in the management of classic TN. Long-term results can be achieved better with appropriate central neurosurgical procedures and pharmacotherapy."

abstract,"Abstract ObjectiveArticaine entered clinical use in 1976; however, evidence basis for articaine’s reputation is not entirely clear. The aim of the study is to compare and analyze 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in patients operated for mandibular third molar impaction with respect to efficacy and safety, time of onset and duration of anesthesia and duration of postoperative analgesia.
Methods The study was done on fifty patients requiring surgical extraction of mandibular third molar; randomly divided into two groups of 25 each, receiving 4% articaine hydrochloride with 1:100,000 epinephrine and 2% lignocaine hydrochloride with 1:100,000 epinephrine. Difficulty index for extraction, volume, onset and duration of anesthesia and duration of postoperative analgesia were recorded. Pain was assessed using Heft-Parker VAS. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical analysis.
Results The mean onset time for articaine and lignocaine is 3.16 ± 0.55 and 3.2 ± 0.48 min, respectively. Articaine group experienced statistically significant longer period of analgesia and duration of action 289.04 ± 40 and 361.88 ± 40 min, respectively, as compared to lignocaine which is 144.2 ± 12 and 197.44 ± 25 min, respectively. No statistical difference between the two groups with regard to pain experience.Conclusion4% Articaine is more potent and has longer duration of action with better postoperative analgesia and could be considered as an alternative to lignocaine in clinical practice. With management of postoperative pain being the critical component of patient care, clinical trials are required to develop long acting local anesthetic with increased postoperative analgesia effect."

abstract,"Abstract Purpose
Current ballistics and high-energy explosion possess unnoticed, new and significant biophysics and pathophysiology wounding effects that are unique in comparison with civilian trauma. The primary blast wave effects of compressed air due to explosion lead to tattered and crushed eggshell injuries to the upper central midface (UCM). High-energy shell fragments of various shapes and sizes cause extensive destruction and are different from assault rifle’s bullets that cause high energy transfer to the tissue by creating a temporary cavitation.
Methods Twenty-one patients with unquantifiable war injuries were selected. The emergency managment of lifesaving facial war injuries starts with life threatening hemorrahge or air compramise. This article describes immediate management of medial canthal tendon (MCT), intercanthal region and severe nasal war injuries.
Results The utilized procedure obtained good results compared to the results of cases treated only by applying a classic approach of civilian fractures.ConclusionTreatments of UCM injuries are the most difficult since UCM includes the esthetic, physiologic, and anatomical regions of the face. The proposed technique provides immediate excellent stability for soft tissues, bone, and cartilage and is well tolerated in the long term by both the tissue and the patient. Most of the times, victims are treated with limited resources, deficient subspecialty, massive injuries, during mass casualties, and a single surgeon must have to handle all these within a short period of time. UCM injuries are really concerning since this region is the core of facial esthetic and function.

abstract,"Abstract AimThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of buccal fat pad-derived stem cells (BFPSCs) as a source for full thickness bone defect repair secondary to pathology in maxilla or mandible.Methods Fat-derived stem cells were isolated from buccal fat pad, differentiated into osteocytes in osteogenic medium, and seeded onto human bone defects. Autologous buccal fat pad was harvested and BFPSCs cultured within 4–6 weeks. Bone defects secondary to enucleation of pathologic cyst or tumors were reconstructed with osteogenically differentiated fat-derived stem cells. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase and genotypic and phenotypic marker analysis, and histomorphometric measurements of new bone were performed.Results Maxillofacial bone defects were successfully reconstructed by BFPSCs, which after implantation at an in vivo site yielded faster osseous regeneration. BFPSCs were associated with superior bone density formation, better blending of margins with enhanced bone trabecular formation, well-organized and well-vascularized lamellar bone with Haversian channels and osteocytes resulting in superior functional and cosmetic results with better quality of life and with significant decrease in secondary complications.ConclusionBuccal fat pad is an ideal tool in the hands of an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for tissue engineering and clinical use requiring bone tissue growth and repair, secondary to large osseous defects. This study demonstrates the feasibility of reconstructing bony defects with fat-derived stem cells."

abstract,"Abstract Background 
Tramadol has been shown to have a local anaesthetic effect when used as infiltration anaesthesia.Methods The local anaesthetic efficacy of tramadol was compared with that of lignocaine for the extraction of teeth in terms of their onset of action, duration of action, intraoperative pain, post-operative analgesic effect and adverse reactions. Apart from this, incidence of allergic reaction was also recorded for both the drugs. A total of 100 patients were divided into two groups randomly. Each patient was assigned to receive either a maximum of 2 ml of 5% tramadol (Supridol 50 mg, Neon laboratories), Group T (n = 50), as a local anaesthetic solution for extraction of maxillary premolar for orthodontic reason under supraperiosteal infiltration following strict aseptic precaution or a maximum of 2 ml of 2% lignocaine (Lox 2%, Neon laboratories), Group L (n = 50), in a double-blinded fashion.Results In group T, the mean subjective onset of action was 33.66 s, while in group L it was 33.06 s (p = 0.881). In group T, the mean objective onset of action was 3.04 min, while in group L it was 3.18 min (p > 0.05). The mean duration of action in group T was 55.60 min, while in group L it was 57.50 min (p = 0.432). Only 2 patients in group T and 1 patient in group L had nausea (p = 0.245).ConclusionWe conclude that 5% tramadol has a local anaesthetic efficacy similar to 2% lignocaine but is comparatively a weaker agent."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeTo assess Serum Prealbumin in the severity of illness and monitor response to treatment in odontogenic space infection.
Patients and Methods This was a prospective cohort study comprising patients being managed for odontogenic space infection at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The calculated sample size was 69. Clinical parameters (Swelling Size, Visual Analogue Scale for pain intensity, and Maximal Interincisal Distance) were measured on day 0, day 4, and day 8. Other clinical parameters were Number of Anatomic Spaces Involved, setting of treatment, and Length of Hospital Stay. Serum Prealbumin levels were also serially measured. The relationship between Serum Prealbumin level and the clinical parameters was established using Spearman’s correlation test, independent t test, Friedman’s test, and linear regression. Significance level was set at .05.Results The mean Serum Prealbumin level at presentation (day 0) was 19.19 ± 4.61 mg/dl, which was significantly lower among inpatients (p = 0.001). On days 0, 4, and 8, Serum Prealbumin negatively correlated with Number of Anatomic Spaces Involved (p < 0.001). Serum Prealbumin levels on days 0, 4, and 8 and response in Serum Prealbumin negatively correlated with Length of Hospital Stay. On each day, Serum Prealbumin negatively correlated with pain intensity and Swelling Size and positively correlated with mouth opening. The response in Serum Prealbumin also positively correlated with response in each of the three clinical parameters.ConclusionThis study suggests that Serum Prealbumin is a reliable tool for grading severity of illness and monitoring response to treatment in odontogenic space infection."

abstract,"Abstract Aims  & objectivesTo analyze the soft tissue response in patients treated by combined anterior segmental bimaxillary procedures.Methods A  Prospective, observational and analytical study was carried out for a period of 2 years involving 37 patients with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria; lateral cephalograms were taken by the same operator on the standardized unit immediately before and 6 months after surgery; hard and soft tissue landmarks were measured in millimeters to both horizontal and vertical reference lines; any differences in distances were recorded as a surgical change; appropriate statistical test was carried; level of significance was p < 0.05.Results All patients underwent anterior maxillary osteotomy with 34 anterior mandibular osteotomies, 2 advancement genioplasties and 1 reduction genioplasty. Analysis showed significant angular, horizontal and vertical change. The significant differences in skeletal variables were observed in N–Pg distance, overjet, overbite, U1–NF angle, L1–Mp angle and soft tissue variables like labiomental angle, upper–lower lip protrusion, upper–lower lip length and lower incisor to labrale inferius distance. Nasolabial angle, interlabial gap and upper incisor exposure were extremely significant.ConclusionSoft tissue response to surgery is perhaps more predictable after 6 months, so this may be a treatment modality of choice in adult bimaxillary/dentoalveolar protrusion patients who need instant esthetic facial results."

abstract,"Abstract AimSynovial chondromatosis (SC) is a benign condition that is characterized by the formation of cartilaginous nodules within the synovial tissue of a joint that may detach and form loose bodies inside the articular space. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of surgical arthroscopy for the treatment of SC of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).Materials and Methods A series of six patients treated with arthroscopy (one patient requiring an open arthrotomy due to the size of the loose bodies) in our centre between 1997 and 2016 is presented and results are discussed. A systematic review of the literature of patients with SC treated with arthroscopy or arthroscopy-assisted open arthrotomy is also carried out.Results Pain, which was the main symptom in our patients, and maximum mouth opening both improved significantly after surgical treatment. Three of the patients were diagnosed with primary SC, and the other 3 had a previous diagnosis of internal derangement. None of the patients showed signs of relapse during the follow-up period.Conclusions Surgical arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the extraction of loose bodies and even partial synovectomy of the affected membrane with good results and without recurrence of the disease. This technique can be useful in cases of SC with loose bodies measuring less than 3 mm or without extra-articular extension."

abstract,"Abstract Background Photographic soft-tissue norms of Iranian race are not reported previously, nor are they compared with other ethnicities. Besides, sex dimorphism is assessed in only very few studies on soft-tissue profile. The aim of this study was to assess the soft-tissue measurements of Iranians with good occlusion and the existing sex dimorphism and to compare the Iranian norms with other ethnicities.Materials and Methods Twelve anthropometric variables were measured by a dentist in 100 Iranian subjects with good occlusions. The subjects included 50 males and 50 females. The differences between the two genders, as well as the differences between Iranian norms and the norms in all other ethnicities available in the literature were statistically analyzed using a t test (α = 0.05).Results There were significant differences between males and females regarding frontonasal angle (P = 0.0000), mentolabial sulcus (P = 0.0000), vertical height ratio (P = 0.0000), vertical lip–chin ratio (P = 0.0013), nasolabial angle (P = 0.0019), lower vertical height–depth ratio (P = 0.0029), maxillary prognathism (P = 0.0045), and mandibular prognathism (P = 0.0118). The difference in facial convexity was marginally significant (P = 0.0543). Protrusions of both lips and horizontal distance between the lips were not significantly different between sexes (P > 0.2).Conclusions Unlike Americans and Brazilians but similar to Koreans, there was considerable sex dimorphism in Iranians. Compared to Iranian men, women might have more convex profiles, more advanced mandibles (unlike all other races studied), more protruded maxillae, lips closer to the middle of nose-chin vertical distance, deeper mentolabial sulci, less protruded noses with higher nose tips, and smaller lower faces."

abstract,"Abstract ObjectiveAim of the study is to predict the difficulty in intubation preoperatively using ultrasonography.Methods One hundred and thirty-seven patients underwent ultrasound followed by surgery under general anesthesia. A experienced radiologist examined the airway and performed measurements of specific airway parameters: visualization of hyoid bone, visualization of vocal cords through thyroid cartilage, visualization of epiglottis, distance from base of tongue to hyoid bone, distance of hyomental region distance of thyrohyoid region, distance between skin and fat pad thickness to thyroid cartilage, thickness of submental region, distance from epiglottis to skin (above hyoid), and visualization of cricothyroid membrane. After performing ultrasound, patient was presented for surgery. An experienced anesthesiologist who is associated with this study did all the laryngoscopy and intubation.Results We were able to visualize all relevant anatomical structures in all the participants using ultrasound. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results showed that hyomental is ≤ 1.09 (P value < 0.01) to classify difficult in intubation.ConclusionThe study shows that ultrasound can reliably image all the airway structures. This study suggests that hyomental distance is a more valid criterion in predicting difficult intubation. Further, case control study is needed for assessing the ease of intubation."

abstract,"Abstract AimThe aim of the study is to describe the technique and also the outcome of using buccal fat pad (BFP) as an adjunct flap in cleft palate repair and to report the surgical outcome.Materials and Methods All the surgical repairs with BFP were done under general anaesthesia. The use of BFP was indicated in patients who needed a secondary palatal cleft repair, those with wide palatal clefts or patients whose primary palatal cleft repair was complicated intraoperatively by inadvertent tearing of the nasal mucosa. The raw wound surfaces were dressed with Vaseline gauze instilled with Framycetin. All subjects 4 years of age and below had oral toileting with warm saline-soaked gauze after each meal. The other patients had oral toileting with warm saline mouth bath in addition to conventional toothbrushing.Results Eight patients were included in this study with an age range of 1–26 years (mean ± SD = 6.1 ± 8.6 years). Three patients presented with wide palatal clefts, another three presented with dehiscence after a primary repair which necessitated a secondary repair, while the remaining two patients had inadvertent iatrogenic tear of the nasal mucosa during the primary surgical repair. For the latter set of patients, repair was completed by the use of BFP as an adjunct at the same surgery. Post-operative evaluation was satisfactory in all cases, with healing of the flaps and complete epithelialization of the BFP in 1 month. All the patients experienced post-operative cheek swelling, signifying the post-operative oedema due to BFP harvest. However, this was usually resolved within 48 h. Healing was satisfactory with full epithelialization, and no complications were observed.Conclusions Successful application of BFP as an adjunct flap in palatal cleft closure is demonstrated in these series. It is recommended that cleft surgeons add this technique to their armamentarium in difficult cases, especially in wide palatal cleft repair, secondary palatal cleft repair and in cases of inadvertent tearing of nasal mucosa during primary cleft palate repair."

abstract,Abstract  Medical leeches (Hirudo medicinalis) in plastic and reconstructive surgery are often used for the treatment of vascular failure after microvascular surgery. Leeches are a reservoir for bacteria of the Aeromonas group that help digesting the blood meal. In some cases these bacteria are able to cause severe wound infections that can lead to loss of tissue transplants. We report about a patient with a common microvascular forearm flap after resection of an oral squamous cell carcinoma which got infected by Aeromonas spp. after treatment with medical leeches. Most of these species are resistant for common antibiotic treatment after surgery. This report shows the importance of an early concomitant antibiotic prophylaxis in the treatment of venous congestion with medical leeches.

abstract,"Abstract PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of orthodontic mini-screws as a modified suture anchor for disc repositioning in cases of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint.Patients and Methods A prospective evaluation of ten patients was undertaken for a period of 6 months using this modified approach from Jan 2014 to Jun 2016. Symptomatic patients with clinical and MRI features suggestive of internal derangement of TMJ and willing to undergo surgical repositioning of articular disc to alleviate symptoms of temporomandibular dysfunction were taken up for the study. Post-operatively, functional outcomes were assessed in terms of reduction in pain, joint movement and absence of joint noise and clicking sounds. Post-operative MRI was used to assess the disc position and morphological changes in the disc and arthritic changes in the condyle.Results All patients underwent a surgical repositioning of the anteriorly displaced disc by the modified orthodontic suture anchor. Patients were post-surgically followed up at intervals of 1, 3 and 6 months. Immediate complications in terms of pain, restriction of functional motion and transient facial nerve palsy were noted. Late complications include temporal nerve palsy in one case. All patients experienced significant improvement with good functional outcomes and stable repositioning of disc was noticed at the end of 6 months.ConclusionThe modified disc repositioning using an orthodontic screw via a mini preauricular approach provided a good functional outcome in all patients as assessed over a period of 6 months. However, the long-term functional sequel of the procedure and changes in the articular disc needs to be assessed."

The high rate of mortality associated with cancer is due to its inherent nature to metastasize. Perineural invasion (PNI) is a relatively rare mode of metastasis, and a distinct pathologic entity that can be observed in the absence of lymphatic or vascular invasion which is still shrouded by mystery. PNI is a marker of poor prognosis. Despite increasing recognition of this metastatic process, there has been little progress in the understanding of mechanisms behind PNI. The purpose of this article is to make surgeons aware of caudad to cephalad metastasis of oral cancer along trigeminal nerve.

From the very understanding of the difference between its two distinct forms, hemangiomas and vascular malformations to its management remain confusing. The review of this anomaly attempts at comprehensively understanding the disease. Vascular anomalies are easily diagnosed by their clinical presentation, but choice of imaging and management for this spectrum of lesions is varied. The author attempts to categorize the required imaging for the lesion with suggestions on the management of both hemangiomas and vascular malformations. The available treatment options are discussed, and a comprehensive algorithm for management is suggested. Further research in developing drugs that could restrict the growth of these lesions would be the future of the management of vascular lesions."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionThere has been a changing trend of treating temporomandibular joint subluxation, which range from conservative non-surgical measures to various soft and hard tissue surgical procedures aimed at either augmenting or restricting the condylar path.AimThis study was aimed at comparing the efficacy of three major surgical treatment modalities: condylar obstruction creation, obstruction removal and anti-translatory procedures. Also, the location, anatomy and morphology of the TMJs pre- and post-surgery were evaluated and compared using radiographs, sagittal and 3-D Computed Tomographic scans.Materials and Methods A 6-year study was carried out on seventy-five patients of various age groups. Twenty-five were operated by the Dautrey’s procedure, 25 by articular eminectomy alone and the remaining 25 by eminectomy followed by meniscal plication and tethering. The distribution of patients in the three groups was random. Effectiveness of the surgical procedure and incidence of complications including recurrence were carefully compiled and compared between the three groups.Results  and ConclusionDautrey’s procedure yielded more gratifying and stable results, leading to a successful and permanent correction of chronic recurrent dislocation of the TMJs, with practically nil complications, thus demonstrating it to be an extremely safe, effective and versatile technique, making the joints function normally and securing sufficient volume of mouth opening. There was observed an average increase in articular tubercle height by 3.65 mm and a mean anterior shift of its lowest point by 4.5 mm following the Dautrey’s procedure, which were statistically significant findings. The upper age limit to carry out the Dautrey’s procedure can be safely taken up to 45 years."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeThe purpose of this prospective randomized single blinded split mouth study was to conduct a comparative evaluation of the efficacy of intranasal atomised spray formulation of Dexmedetomidine with Midazolam in patients undergoing surgical removal of bilaterally impacted mandibular third molars.Methods This prospective study was conducted in twenty volunteers. Each volunteer underwent the surgical removal of an impacted mandibular third molar at two separate appointments at an interval of two weeks. The first third molar surgery was conducted using either intranasal Midazolam (Group M) or intranasal Dexmedetomidine (Group D). At the second appointment the surgical procedure was performed using the sedative agent not used at the first appointment. The primary testing outcome variables were Plasma oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse and blood pressure and Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. These were recorded at predetermined intervals starting 10 min before the administration of local anaesthesia and continued up to 10 min after completion of the procedure. In addition surgeon’s opinion regarding the patient cooperation, event amnesia, post operative nausea & vomiting were obtained.Results The sample composed of twenty patients (M = 9 and F = 11). There was statistically no significant difference between Group M and Group D with respect to mean SpO2. Minor differences were however noted at 20 and 30 min after sedation. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to mean pulse rate, blood pressure, OAA/S, event amnesia, post operative nausea and vomiting and patient cooperation.ConclusionWe conclude that Midazolam and Dexmedetomidine are equivalent and can be used in minor oral surgery with minimal complications. These drugs can be used intranasally using nasal atomization device in routine outpatient basis in otherwise normal healthy but anxious patients. All procedures must however be performed in the presence of an anaesthesiologist and with ready availability of emergency drugs and equipment."

A retrospective analysis of survival rates of advanced-stage OSCC patients treated with multimodal therapies (S-RT or combined chemoradiation) was performed to analyse the outcome for patient survival and whether addition of adjuvant chemotherapy (S-CRT) improves survival.Materials and Methods Demographic, pathological, treatment and follow-up data of 128 patients were included in the study. Sixty-nine patients received S-RT, while 55 patients were opted for S-CRT. Overall survival, disease-specific survival and disease-free survival were estimated with Kaplan–Meier analysis and compared between groups with Cox regression analysis.Results Survival was significantly influenced by the type of modality and regional spread of disease. S-CRT group had improved overall, disease-specific, disease-free and metastasis-free survival compared to S-RT group. A survival advantage of 10% was achieved in S-CRT group compared to S-RT group even in patients with extracapsular spread and perineural invasion.ConclusionAddition of adjuvant chemotherapy to S-RT improves survival outcomes in advanced OSCC, especially in patients with regional spread of disease."

abstract,"Abstract Background  Osteosarcomas of head and neck region have unique biology and exhibit a clinical behavior and natural history that is distinct from osteosarcomas of the trunk and extremities. Our understanding of this malignant bone tumor is largely based on data from single institutions or compiled from registries, and hence the clinical practice guidelines seem confusing and conflicting.Aims  and ObjectivesTo analyze the demographic profile, disease characteristics and survival outcomes of osteosarcoma of head and neck region.Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of the patients treated for osteosarcoma of head and neck region with curative intent in the period between the years 2001–2013 at a tertiary cancer center from South India.Results A total of 14 patients were treated in the said period with a mean age of 37 years. The most common site was mandible (n = 9 patients) followed by maxilla (n = 4) and paranasal sinuses (n = 1). Conventional osteoblastic variant of OS was the most common histological variant (n = 8) followed by the chondroblastic variant (n = 5). The median disease-free survival was 41.7 months, whereas the median overall survival of our patient cohort was 47.6 months. A formal analysis of various prognostic factors showed only postoperative margin positivity to be the single important factor affecting the survival outcomes.ConclusionHead and neck osteosarcoma that most commonly afflicts the jaw bones occurs in the fourth decade of life. Despite being a small series, our study does highlight the importance of achieving a margin-negative resection as a part of the multimodality treatment of head and neck osteosarcomas. Considering the relative paucity of data, there is a need for multi-institutional collaborative studies to refine the therapeutic strategies for the management of patients with head and neck osteosarcomas."

Both the groups were followed up on the 1st day, 3rd day, 1st week, 1st month, 3rd month post operatively and were evaluated for pain, swelling, infection, fever, spontaneous wound dehiscence, purulent discharge and any other adverse effects.Results Post operative infection when measured clinically and radiographically was comparatively higher in Group B. Out of 72 patients in both the groups, 5 patients each in Group A and Group B reported with wound dehiscence, 9 patients in both groups developed pyrexia.ConclusionThough the post operative infection was slightly more in Group B compared to Group A, 1 day antibiotic regimen was found to be equally effective when compared to 5 day regimen and helps in reducing the after effects, superinfection and antibiotic resistance. It has better patient compliance and is cost effective."

abstract,"Abstract Background Injuries sustained to the maxillofacial region can result in significant physical trauma and long lasting psychosocial impairment. Maxillofacial trauma has been reported in literature to be a potentially recurrent disease. Patients who suffer maxillofacial trauma can benefit from psychological support.AimThis study aims to identify maxillofacial trauma patient characteristics, investigate maxillofacial re-injury rate after provision of psychological support and report incidence of post traumatic stress disorder symptoms after maxillofacial trauma.MethodA total of 100 patients were identified from the departmental trauma database over two time periods at Royal Darwin Hospital; 50 patients did not have psychosocial intervention and 50 patients received intervention. Data on demographics, trauma pattern and aetiology were collected. A brief counselling session was conducted on second patient group by a trained mental health nurse and a survey using Trauma Screening Questionnaire was completed one month following injury.Results The most common cause of injuries was assault in both groups followed by falls and the most common site of injuries was in the mandible in both groups. Almost half of all patients were in the15–24 and 25–34 age groups. 17 % of patients in pre-intervention period and 4 % of patients in intervention period had injury recurrence at 3 year follow up. Patient groups at risk of developing post traumatic symptoms included male, non-indigenous population, employed group with no alcohol involvement.ConclusionMaxillofacial trauma can cause considerable psychological morbidity and expose the patient to high risk of post traumatic disorder symptoms. This type of injury was found to affect particular groups of population and is associated with high rate of recurrence. Psychological support should be provided to these patients as a routine part of trauma aftercare."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionTechnological advances in 3D printing can dramatically improve orthognathic surgical planning workflow. Custom positioning and cutting guides enable intraoperative reproduction of pre-planned osteotomy cuts and can result in greater surgical accuracy and patient safety.ObjectivesThis short paper describes the use of freeware (some with open-source) combined with in-house 3D printing facilities to produce reliable, affordable osteotomy cutting guides.Methods Open-source software (3D Slicer) is used to visualise and segment three-dimensional planning models from imported conventional computed tomography (CT) scans. Freeware (Autodesk Meshmixer ©) allows digital manipulation of maxillary and mandibular components to plan precise osteotomy cuts. Bespoke cutting guides allow exact intraoperative positioning. These are printed in polylactic acid (PLA) using a fused-filament fabrication 3D printer. Fixation of the osteotomised segments is achieved using plating templates and four pre-adapted plates with planned screw holes over the thickest bone. We print maxilla/ mandible models with desired movements incorporated to use as a plating template.Results A 3D printer capable of reproducing a complete skull can be procured for £1000, with material costs in the region of £10 per case. Our production of models and guides typically takes less than 24 hours of total print time. The entire production process is frequently less than three days. Externally sourced models and guides cost significantly more, frequently encountering costs totalling £1500–£2000 for models and guides for a bimaxillary osteotomy.ConclusionThree-dimensional guided surgical planning utilising custom cutting guides enables the surgeon to determine optimal orientation of osteotomy cuts and better predict the skeletal maxilla/mandible relationship following surgery. The learning curve to develop proficiency using planning software and printer settings is offset by increased surgical predictability and reduced theatre time, making this form of planning a worthy investment."

abstract,"Abstract Background Endodontic treatment is usually indicated when teeth with periapical lesions are encountered. However, sometimes root canal treatment results in failure. In that case, one of the treatment choices is retreatment by an orthograde approach. Surgical endodontic therapy is also an alternative to preserve the tooth. Various techniques have been suggested in the literature which has more predictable results. The introduction of modern surgical techniques have enhanced the results of apical surgery procedures. Operating microscopes, magnifying loupes, microinstruments, ultrasonic tips, and biologically acceptable root-end filling materials (such as MTA and SuperEBA) have been introduced to this field with the modern technique, thus the success rates of modern apical surgery has increased significantly.ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes and periotest values of apical surgery treatment.Methods A total of 112 teeth were included. SuperEBA and MTA were used as root-filling materials. The recorded parameters were gender, age, location of the tooth, the presence/absence of a post, coronal restoration of the tooth, previous surgical/nonsurgical treatment of the tooth, the size of periapical lesions, histopathology of periapical lesions, smoking habits. Also the periotest values were recorded.Results The overall success rate was 88.4%. With regard to the evaluated variables, only one parameter (tooth type) was found statistically significant. Although the periotest values were decreased after 6 months compared to immediately postoperative measurements, the values were still significantly higher than preoperative measurements.ConclusionIn this study, apical surgery performed with the modern instruments has significantly successful results with 88.4% success rate."

abstract,"Abstract ObjectivesTo compare reconstructed area and surface roughness of 3D models acquired using nine image acquisition protocols. Radiation dose was also compared among acquisition protocols.Methods A dry craniofacial specimen was scanned using three CT devices (a cone beam CT, a 16-channel fan beam CT, and a 64-channel fan beam CT), with three different acquisition protocols each. Nine 3D models were manufactured using polylactic acid. Surface roughness and reconstructed area were determined for each 3D model. The radiation dose during acquisitions was measured using lithium crystals. ANOVA was used to compare the data among the 3D models. Linear function optimization techniques based on stochastic variables were applied to identify the most suitable protocol for use.Results For surface roughness, statistically significant differences were observed among all 3D models and the specimen. For reconstructed area, CBCT and one CT-16 channel protocols originated 3D models statistically significant different from the specimen. Higher radiation doses were observed with fan beam CT acquisitions.Conclusions All three CT devices were suitable for 3D printing when used at full resolution. The highest reconstruct area vs. radiation dose ratio was found for 64-channel CT devices."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeTraditionally, the “Halstead block” has been widely used to provide anesthesia in mandibular teeth. Two other techniques, the Gow Gates mandibular nerve block and the Akinosi Vazirani closed-mouth mandibular nerve block, are reliable alternatives to the conventional inferior alveolar nerve block. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the onset of anesthesia, anesthetic success and incidence of positive aspiration during administration of local anesthetic solution using the Halstead, Vazirani Akinosi and Gow Gates techniques.Materials and methodThe study involves 210 subjects, divided into three different groups of 70 subjects each receiving Gow Gates, Vazirani Akinosi and conventional inferior alveolar nerve blocks. The onset of anesthesia, positive aspiration and anesthetic success was evaluated.Results In Vazirani Akinosi technique group, patients showed highest anesthetic success of 95.71%; there was a significant difference seen between the Gow Gates and Vazirani Akinosi techniques (p = 0.0241*). The mean value of the onset of anesthesia in Gow Gates technique showed the longest 343.71 ± 153.20 s, in Halstead technique it was 177.43 ± 59.94 s, and in Vazirani Akinosi technique it was 192.86 ± 61.20 s. There was a significant difference seen between Gow Gates and Vazirani Akinosi techniques (p = 0.0001*) and Gow Gates and inferior alveolar nerve block techniques (p = 0.0001*).ConclusionThe Vazirani Akinosi technique was found to be significantly better than the other two techniques with respect to both onset and success of anesthesia.

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionSurgical treatment of condylar neck fractures requires an extraoral approach when, due to the degree of difficulty of the fracture, an intraoral approach or an endoscopically supported treatment is not possible. In contrast to the cosmetically more favorable oral approach, extraoral approaches offer a better overview of the operating field and thus an easier fracture repositioning and osteosynthetic treatment. In 2007, Marti et al. described a minimal pre- and retroauricular incision with no extension to the hair-bearing skin and which aimed to improve the parotidectomy approach.Materials and Methods We present two cases in which minimal incision was used as a surgical approach for treatment of the condylar neck.DiscussionUsing the minimal incision, we were able to access the condylar neck. This type of approach as well as having the advantages of an open approach makes it possible to conceal the scar in the periauricular region and reduce the likelihood of salivary fistula."

Patient’s demographic data, APFEL score for risk of PONV, duration of surgery and duration of anesthesia were recorded preoperatively. The test arm of the study received inhalation of 70% IPA every half an hour in the postoperative period for 8 h along with ondansetron 4 mg i.v. every 6 h. The control arm received only ondansetron 4 mg i.v. every 6 h. Both the groups followed the same preoperative and postoperative instruction and drug protocol except the test drug. PONV was recorded using the simplified PONV intensity score and VAS. The scores were analyzed with Mann–Whitney test with < 0.05 considered significant.Results The groups were similar with regard to age (p = 0.083), BMI (p = 0.1.00), sex (p = 0.379), type of surgery (p = 0.504), duration of anesthesia (p = 0.621), duration of surgery (p = 0.515) and APFEL score (p = 0.687). IPA inhalation group achieved significantly better simplified PONV scores and VAS scores at 4 h (p = 0.000), 6 h (p = 0.000) and 8 h (p = 0.000). PONV control at 2 h was similar to the control group.ConclusionInhalation of 70% IPA every half an hour was associated with significant PONV control in maxillofacial surgery patients undergoing surgery under GA."

This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of two Orbita plates in Champy’s osteosynthesis lines along with achieving 3D configuration and preventing trauma to mental foramen.
Aims (1) To achieve a near 3D configuration by fixing the terminal parts of both plates in contact with each other; (2) to preserve the mental nerve within the ellipse created by two Orbita plates; and (3) to prevent damage to the root apices from the upper plate.Materials and Methods This study was performed on 20 patients with mandible body fracture through the mental foramina. With the intraoral vestibular approach, two Orbita miniplates were fixed in Champy’s osteosynthesis lines. A geometrically closed quadrangular relationship was achieved in the shape of an ellipse, with the mental nerve emerging from it.
Results Fracture healing was optimum in all the cases along with satisfactory occlusion. Postoperative intermaxillary fixation was not required. Mental nerve function impairment was insignificant.
ConclusionThis served to achieve satisfactory functional outcomes in patients with mandible body fracture without injury to roots and along with achieving a geometrically close quadrangular relationship even where 3D miniplates cannot be placed."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionThe facial disfigurement and functional debility resulting from craniomaxillofacial injuries in low-intensity conflict scenarios can physically and psychologically traumatize the afflicted personnel. Efficient and definitive management, with complete esthetic restoration and functional rehabilitation, is not only an organizational obligation, but also a tactical necessity to maintain a high state of morale among the troops. There exist two schools of thought on principles of management of such injuries. The older, three-phased approach consists of initial debridement and suturing, followed by conservative closed reduction in maxillofacial fractures using splints and ligatures, thereafter followed by delayed repair and late reconstruction of residual bone defects and deformities after the soft tissue healing is complete. The newer trend involves early and aggressive open surgical reduction and craniomaxillofacial fixation techniques along with reconstructive procedures carried out hand in hand with the soft tissue debridement and closure.AimThe aim was to compare the efficacy of the two management protocols, namely the contemporary approach of early aggressive surgical intervention, versus the conservative approach of initial debridement, closed reduction and delayed repair, as the definitive treatment modality of maxillofacial injuries sustained in low-intensity conflicts.Methods This retrospective analytical study included 40 patients with maxillofacial injuries sustained in combat scenarios treated over a period of 3 years. These patients who had been treated for ballistic maxillofacial injuries were divided into two groups: The first group of 20 patients (Group 1) included those who had undergone an early, aggressive, surgical intervention, and the second group of 20 patients (Group 2) included those who had undergone resuscitation and primary soft tissue closure followed by conservative, closed reduction techniques, delayed repair (including open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedures), and late reconstruction of bone soft tissue defects (which included utilization of various grafts and flaps). Both groups were evaluated and compared for postoperative recovery and early and late complications such as impaired esthetic results and impaired functional recovery.Results Early, definitive, and aggressive maxillofacial surgical techniques proved superior to the conservative approach by bringing about primary bone healing and minimizing residual deformities and subsequent scar contractures, thus yielding improved functional as well as superior esthetic outcomes.ConclusionIn today’s low-intensity conflict scenario, the emphasis in management of maxillofacial injury victims should be on an early, definitive, and aggressive surgical repair and reconstruction of the facial skeleton, thus restoring quality of life to these soldiers, sparing them life-long indignity after a potentially severe esthetically and functionally debilitating injury."

abstract,"Abstract IntroductionLipoma is a benign mesenchymal tumor originating from adipose tissue cells. In the head and neck, this tumor is not common. The occurrence of lipomas in the parotid gland is extremely rare, ranging between 0.6 and 4%.Case ReportsIn this article, we present two clinical cases of lipomas of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland.DiscussionClinical diagnosis of parotid gland lipomas is difficult, while usually, they are asymptomatic and presented as a painless swelling of the parotid gland. Tomographic imaging modalities are very accurate in preoperative diagnosis in contrast to FNA or FNAB which is not helpful in the case of lipoma. This pathological entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of parotid gland’s mass lesions. The usual indication for surgical intervention is cosmetic appearance. Meticulous surgical excision should be performed to avoid disturbing adverse events."

abstract,"Abstract Oral cancer is a major health problem in India, and in certain parts, it represents more than 50% of all cancers. Since almost all of these patients receive chemo-radiotherapy with or without surgery for treatment, a vast majority of them also develop oral mucositis, a debilitating adverse effect of chemo-radiation. There have been various reports in the literature regarding the beneficial role of honey in the management of oral mucositis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the application of honey in mucositis confers any significant improvement in lesions of mucositis and more specifically whether application of honey brings about any improvement in the quality of life of patients suffering from chemo-radiation-induced oral mucositis. If found to be beneficial, honey could provide a simple, elegant and cost-effective solution to a troublesome health problem, thus benefiting a large number of patients."

abstract,"Abstract Aims  and ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare cephalograms for the hard and soft tissue changes observed in skeletal Class III patients of Indian origin who had undergone either single-jaw mandibular setback (BSSO) or bimaxillary surgery (Le Fort I advancement + BSSO setback) and also to derive a correlation between the changes brought about in the soft tissues by the surgical alteration in hard tissue.
Materials and Methods The study included records comprising 18 treated skeletal Class III patients, who were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedures advocated: Group I: single-jaw procedure comprised of only mandibular set back, Group II: bimaxillary surgery. Presurgical and post-treatment cephalograms were calibrated and traced using Ilexis FACAD AB-2014 Version 3.8.0.0 software and analyzed with COGS hard tissue analysis and soft tissue analysis. All values for the hard tissue and soft tissue measurements were compared with the norms prescribed for the Indian population.
Results Upper lip changes were evident in both groups but greater significance was observed in bi-jaw group. Single-jaw patients showed positive correlation for hard to soft tissue mandibular position. Bi-jaw surgical cases exhibited positive correlations between changes Wits variable to soft tissue convexity as well as mandibular position.
ConclusionThe soft tissues changes between Class III patients treated by single-jaw surgery and those treated by bimaxillary surgery when compared revealed that significant differences were observed only in relation to certain measurements such as facial convexity, maxillary prognathism, and upper lip protrusion."

abstract,"Abstract Aims 
This study aims to compare the outcome of radiosurgically assisted incision technique with the conventional scalpel blade technique in impacted mandibular third molar incisions.
Methods 
On 100 patients (50 patients each in GROUP R and GROUP S) with impacted mandibular third molar, incisions were given using radio surgical and scalpel technique, respectively. Impacted third molars were classified according to Winter’s classification. Two types of incisions (Ward’s and modified Ward’s) were performed. Results  were evaluated considering various parameters like surgical ease, field of surgery, odour, bleeding, discomfort/pain, post-operative analgesic intake and healing in both groups.Results In our study, mean age of patient was 25.30 years, 54% were females and 46% males; mesioangular was the most common type of impaction, and the average length of incision was 3.105 ± 0.546 cm. There was a significant statistical difference (p < 0.01) in the five measure moments (field of surgery, surgical ease, intra-operative bleeding, odour and post-operative analgesic intake at 3–5th day) between the impacted molars operated with scalpel and the ones done with radiosurgery. There was statistically insignificant difference in pain/discomfort, healing and post-operative analgesic intake at 1st and 7–10th day.
Conclusions Radiosurgery was very effective in providing clear field of surgery, surgical ease and created less intra-operative bleeding than scalpel blade surgery making day to day minor oral surgery less stress full and productive."

abstract,"Abstract Background Differences in CBCT units and the lack of standardization result in exposure to radiation doses beyond what is required for diagnostic purposes, especially when planning the surgical placement of dental implants.AimTo assess the influence of low- and high-dose milliamperage settings on CBCT images for objective and subjective implant planning among senior specialists (5 years of experience) and juniors (fresh graduates).Materials and Methods Two dry skulls (4 hemi-maxillary segments of the maxilla and 4 hemi-maxillary segments of the mandible) were scanned under low (2 mA) and high (6.3 mA) dosage settings using the Carestream CS 9300 machine. Cross-sectional slices of both image qualities were evaluated by the 5 seniors and the 5 juniors for subjective image utility for implant planning and for objective linear bone measurements.Results There were no significant differences in bone measurements taken on high- or low-dose images by all seniors and by the majority of juniors (p > 0.05). In qualitative image assessments, there was independence between assessment and image quality for almost all observers. For planning posterior mandibular implant placement, increased dosage improved concordance and kappa values between low- and high-dose images for senior observers (from K = 0.287 at low dose to K = 0.718 at high does) but not for juniors (K = 0.661 and K = 0.509 for low and high dose, respectively).ConclusionReduction in milliamperage did not affect diagnostic image quality for objective bone measurements and produced sufficient concordance for qualitative assessment. Judicious optimization of milliamperage settings based on individual diagnostic requirements can result in significant dose reduction without compromising diagnostic decision-making."

abstract,"Abstract Background Patients operated for cleft deformities may have zygomatic hypoplasia secondary to impaired growth of the maxilla. This has, however, not been evaluated in the past.
Subjects and Methods This study was a prospective, case–control study. This included 32 patients, aged between 19 and 25 years, who were divided into cleft and non-cleft groups. The cleft group was further divided into unilateral clefts, bilateral clefts and isolated palatal clefts. In both groups, the zygoma was assessed and compared on both sides clinically using indirect photogrammetry and radiographically using 3D CT. The results were analyzed statistically using the unpaired t test.
Results There was a significant difference in the zygomatic projection on cleft and non-cleft sides in the unilateral cleft group. There was no significant difference in the zygomatic projection of both sides in the other subgroups and the control group.ConclusionThe present study shows that there is a global effect of palato-alveolar cleft repair on the midfacial skeleton. Further studies are required to correlate the impact of age, gender and the technique of palato-alveolar cleft repair with the quantum of malar hypoplasia.

abstract,Abstract Background  Orbital infection related to mandibular third molar infection is extremely rare. Most of cases reported in literature are related to maxillary molar teeth. Odontogenic infections are not common causes of orbital abscess but it should always be put in consideration when dealing with orbital cellulitis and abscess.Case presentationThis is a case of orbital abscess involving the left eye as consequence of lower left third molar infection in otherwise healthy 35-year-old black male patient. CT scan confirmed the unusual pathway of this space infection from the lower third molar and excluded any intracranial involvement. The abscess was drained immediately by intraoral incisions and the tooth was extracted. There was a dramatic improvement in a very short time with normal eye movement.ConclusionThis case demonstrates one of the serious consequences of odontogenic infection which may lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis and blindness if not treated promptly.

abstract,"Abstract PurposeBone loss following extraction is maximum in horizontal dimension. Height is also reduced which is pronounced on the buccal aspect. Various surgical procedures are available to correct the bone volume viz. GBR, onlay bone grafting, alveolar distraction and sandwich osteotomy. Sandwich osteotomy has been found to increase the vertical alveolar bone height successfully.ObjectivesThe objective of the study was to assess the effect of alveolar segmental sandwich osteotomy on alveolar height and crestal width.Materials and MethodologyA prospective study was undertaken from December 2012 to August 2014. Seven patients with 12 implant sites with a mean age of 36 years were recruited. All seven patients with 12 implant sites underwent alveolar segmental sandwich osteotomy and interpositional bone grafting. Alveolar bone height was assessed radiographically preoperatively, immediate post-op, and at 3 months post-op. Alveolar bone width was assessed radiographically preoperatively and at 3 months post-op. Statistical significance was inferred at p < 0.05.Results The mean vertical augmentation at immediate post-op was 6.58 mm (p = 0.001). The vertical augmentation that was achieved 3 months post-op was a mean of 3.75 mm which was statistically significant (p = 0.004). The change in alveolar height from immediate post-op to 3 month post-op was a mean 1.69 mm. The mean change in alveolar crestal width at 3 months was a mean of −0.29 mm (p = 0.57).ConclusionSandwich osteotomy can be used as an alternative technique to increase alveolar bone height prior to implant placement. Moderate alveolar deficiency can be predictably corrected by this technique."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeThis study was designed to investigate the efficacy of the temporomandibular joint arthrocentesis with and without injection of sodium hyaluronate (SH) in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders.Patients and Methods A total of sixty two TMJs in 34 males and 28 females aged 20–65 years comprised the study material. The patients’ complaints were limited mouth opening, TMJ pain, and joint noises during function. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups in which arthrocentesis plus intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate was performed in 1 group and only arthrocentesis was performed in the other group. Both groups contained patients with disc displacement with reduction and without reduction. Clinical evaluation of the patients was done before the procedure, immediately after the procedure, at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Intensity of TMJ pain was assessed using visual analog scales. Maximal mouth opening and lateral jaw movements also were recorded at each follow-up visit.Results Both techniques increased maximal mouth opening, lateral movements, and function, while reducing TMJ pain and noise.Conclusions Although patients benefitted from both techniques, arthrocentesis with injection of SH seemed to be superior to arthrocentesis alone."

abstract,"Abstract The aim of this study is to investigate the position and course of the mandibular canal through the ramus, angle and body of mandible using computed tomographic (CT) imaging pre-operatively and to relate these predetermined values intra-operatively to perform sagittal split ramus osteotomies. Pre-operative CT scans were taken and four points were marked at mandibular foramen, mandibular angle, mandibular body and midpoint and different dimensions of IAN were measured to localize the inferior alveolar nerve. With the obtained values, precise osteotomy cuts were made intra-operatively and intra-operative measurements for position of IAN were noted. Based on the preoperative CT measurements, the chance to encounter IAN bundle, during surgery was evaluated. The present study proved that pre-operative CT imaging prior to BSSO surgical procedure is an effective way to investigate the position and course of the IAN canal through the framework of the mandible and by interpolating these dimensions intra operatively, reduces the risk of direct injury to the IAN bundle."

abstract,"Abstract Background This study was undertaken to compare micromarsupialization and modified micromarsupialization for the management of mucoceles.
Materials and Methods A prospective randomized clinical study was done on thirty patients having mucocele on lower lip. In Group A (n = 15), micromarsupialization and in Group B (n = 15), modified micromarsupialization technique was used. The outcome variables were duration of surgery, intraoperative pain, postoperative pain, healing and recurrence. t test and p values were used to compare the age, duration of lesion, duration of treatment and time taken for healing. The results were expressed as mean with SD. Statistical significance was established at the p ≤ 0.05 level. Analysis of pain (intraoperative, on 3rd, 7th day), intraoperative bleeding and recurrence was done using Fischer’s exact test (p = 0.875, NS).Results The average duration of treatment for Group A was 4.10 ± 0.39 min and for Group B was 5.33 ± 0.2 min. The difference was found to be statistically highly significant (p value ≤0.000). The observed power was 1.000. The difference in the intraoperative and postoperative pain on 3rd and 7th day was not found to be significant as per Fischer’s exact test. The mean time taken for healing of the surgical site in Group A was 7.47 ± 0.64 days and in Group B was 9.87 ± 1.88 days, and the difference was found to be highly significant. The observed power was 0.995.Conclusions Modified micromarsupialization appears to be a safe technique for the management of mucoceles. However, in comparison with micromarsupialization, it has a higher operating and healing time."

The incidence of bacteremia is 70–80 % following tooth extraction, sub gingival scaling and intra ligament injection.Aims  and ObjectivesAim of study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of two topical antimicrobial agents for the prevention of post-surgical bacteremia during mandibular third molar surgery. And objectives were to suggest need of proper topical antimicrobial agents and select proper antibiotics before oral surgical procedures in high risk cardiac patients.Materials and Methods Thirty patients with Class 1, Position B mesioangular impacted mandibular third molar were randomly included in study and divided into 3 groups, each group containing 10 patients. Group I; sterile water group, Group II: povidone-iodine (5 %) group, Group III: chlorhexidine (Q, 2 %) group, pre and post-surgical blood samples were collected and Microbiological analyses of the blood samples were done. The organisms were identified by standard method on grams staining and identification of bacterial species by biochemical tests.Results The clinical parameters like oral hygiene index simplified and periodontal index of Russel showed that all patients in three groups had fair oral hygiene with simple gingivitis on mean. In some individuals with slightly higher OHIS and PI scores, bacteremia was noted. All the pre surgical blood samples were negative for the growth of bacteria after 7 days of culture. In total 30 patients, 12 subjects had postoperative bacteremia. Out of those 12 patients 6 cases (60 %) of group I showed positive bacterial growth in the post surgical blood sample, while 4 cases in group III and 2 cases (20 %) in group II showed the same.ConclusionUse of povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine prior to the oral surgical procedures decreases the incidence of bacteremia as compared to sterile water irrigation. Povidone-iodine significantly reduces the incidence bacteremia and number of organisms compared to chlorhexidine and sterile water."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeUltrasound is extensively being used for imaging of temporomandibular joint as it is non-invasive and relatively inexpensive. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of ultrasound in identifying TMJ with internal derangement and to access its usefulness as a diagnostic tool in patients with TMJ clicking.Methods A case–control study was done: 25 patients  with a complaint of clicking sound while opening the jaw were randomly selected as the study group and 25 patients who were asymptomatic on TMJ examination were selected as the control group. Both the groups were subjected to bilateral ultrasound scanning of the TMJ. The lateral part of capsule to condyle distance (LCCD) and the anterior part of capsule to condyle distance (ACCD) were measured.Results The mean LCCD of all the 50 joints in the control group was 1.3630 mm, and the mean ACCD of the 50 joints was 1.4850 mm. These values were compared with each of the 50 symptomatic joints scanned in the study group. It was noted that 56% of the subjects showed deviation towards right side and 44% showed deviation towards right side. Clicking was heard in all the subjects while opening the mouth on auscultation. The frequency and percentage distribution of negative and non-negative deviations of LCCD from that of control group were noted. In total, 40% showed negative deviation and 60% showed non-negative deviation. In total, 24% of the subjects showed negative deviation and 76% showed non-negative 190 deviation of ACCD when compared with the control group. T test shows that with respect to LCCD measurement there is no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, whereas  ACCD measurements are significantly different between the symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.Conclusions Hence, it can be concluded that auscultation is mandatory in the examination of temporomandibular joint for clicking sound. Ultrasonography, which has shown high specificity, can supplement clinical evaluation in patients with TMJ disorders and can be used as a potential diagnostic tool for identifying internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint with reduction."

abstract,"Abstract Patients with hypoplasia of the midface normally present a flattening of their facial profile due to insufficient development of the nose and maxilla. Treatment aimed to restore function and an aesthetic appearance calls for a Le Fort III osteotomy and the advancement of the midfacial segment either through distraction or interposition of autogenous bone blocks. However, drawbacks in using autogenous bone suggest that use of alternative graft material may be advisable. The present report describes a Le Fort III advancement using two enzyme-treated equine cancellous bone blocks to correct syndromic midfacial hypoplasia in a 22-year-old patient. A 12-mm surgical advancement was achieved, improving the patient’s facial profile. At the 28-month follow-up, the midface advanced position was stable. Equine bone blocks could be a valid alternative to autogenous bone in Le Fort III midface advancement.

abstract,"Abstract Background Bifid mandibular canal (BMC) is a normal anatomical variation and has been less studied in the Indian population. This study was aimed at estimating the prevalence of BMC amongst Indian population.Materials and Methods The study sample comprised of 5800 digital orthopantomograms (OPGs) which were from four zones of India, i.e. North India, South India, East India, and West India (1700 OPGs from each zone). Any pathological or normal digital OPGs having age between 15 and 80 years in the format of jepg or jpg image were included, while OPGs of operated case of hemimandibulectomy and blurred in which mandibular canal was not traceable were excluded from this study. Each radiograph was assessed for BMC based on the classification given by RP Langlais. Four examiners (two Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons and two Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologists) individually assessed every OPG for the presence of BMC. BMC was considered present, if all the examiners detected it independently.Results There were 5800 OPGs examined, out of which 2576 were of women and 3224 were of men. Bifid mandibular canals were observed in 135 (2.3%) out of 5800 digital panoramic images. There was no statistically significant correlation found with regard to age. Bifid mandibular canals were found with a female-to-male ratio of 1:1.2. The most frequently encountered type of BMC was type II (1.34%) followed by type I (0.72%), type IV (0.15%), and type III (0.1%)."

Participants were examined for signs of TMD, including limited mouth opening, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) crepitus, TMJ tenderness, and muscle tenderness. Dentition was divided into four occlusal support zones based on occluding pairs of posterior teeth by using Eichner’s classification: Class A = 4 support zones; Class B = 1–3 support zones or only contact in anterior teeth; Class C = 0 support zones. Fifteen angular and seven linear parameters were used for sagittal craniofacial skeleton analysis.Results 10.3% of participants had limited mouth opening, 49.6% TMJ crepitus, 16.3% TMJ tenderness, and 24.2% muscle tenderness; 45.5% had Class A occlusal support, 38.5% Class B, and 16.0% Class C. Those with Class C had significantly smaller ramus inclination, articular angle, and angles formed by the mandibular plane and shorter facial height compared to Class A and Class B (P < .001). TMD signs were significantly associated with: angles formed by mandibular plane, gonial angle, cranial base angle, effective mandibular length, and anterior facial height (P < .05).Conclusions The alteration of craniofacial structures was significantly associated with TMD signs among elderly Vietnamese. The higher number of lost occlusal support zones, the more significant the changes to craniofacial structures."

Polysomnography revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea. An attempt to treat sleep apnea by continuous positive airway pressure and oral appliance led to a poor clinical response. CT and MRI scans findings revealed a large mass in the tongue base partially obstructing the airway. After the excision of the mass all symptoms, included daytime somnolence, disappeared and a polysomnographic examination showed the normalization of the somnographic parameters.DiscussionAlthough OSA is rarely caused by tumors, each patient with sleep disorders breathing should be examined carefully for the potential presence of an upper aero-digestive tract neoplasm that may contribute to obstruction."

abstract,"Abstract PurposeDespite socket preservation and/or immediate implant placement, resorption of the buccal plate after dental extraction continues to pose esthetic challenges to clinicians. Buccal plate preservation (BPP) is a technique that has been recently proposed with an aim to reduce the incidence of such resorption. This study was conducted to assess the long-term efficacy of BPP in maintaining the thickness of the buccal cortical plate after immediate implant insertion and provisionalization.Materials and Methods Ten consecutive patients were included in this study. Each patient underwent extraction of a non-restorable tooth, BPPPBPP, single immediate implant placement and immediate provisionalization. Cone beam CT scans were taken 3 months after surgery (T1) and 5 years after surgery (T2) to evaluate the effectiveness and longevity of the BPPPBPP technique in maintaining the augmented bone width. Two distinct measurements were taken for bone evaluation: (a) R1: 1 mm apical to the implant platform and (b) R2: 5 mm apical to the implant platform. The long axis of the implant was used as a fixed reference. Statistical test analysis was conducted using the SPSS software. Student’s t test was used to assess statistical significance, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.Results There were six females and four males in the study. The mean age of the sample was 37.6 years (range 23–64 years). At T1, the mean bone thickness of the buccal plate was found to be 2.36 mm at R1 (range: 1.9–3.1), and 2.23 at R2 (range: 1.9–3). At the T2 interval, the mean thickness of the plate was 2.28 mm at R1 (range: 1.7–3) and 2.18 at R2 (range: 1.9–3). The differences in these mean values were not statistically significant.Conclusions BPPPBPP is an effective means for augmentation and maintenance of the buccal cortical plate around an immediately placed and provisionalized dental implant. It is a viable alternative to socket preservation with the added benefit that it allows for immediate implant placement."
