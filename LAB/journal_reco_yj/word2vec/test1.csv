"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is commonly defined as fever higher than 38.3°C on several occasions during at least 3 weeks with uncertain diagnosis after a number of obligatory investigations. The differential diagnosis of FUO can be subdivided in four categories: infections, malignancies, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes. In most cases of FUO, there is an uncommon presentation of a common disease. FDG-PET/CT is a sensitive diagnostic technique for the evaluation of FUO by facilitating anatomical localization of focally increased FDG uptake, thereby guiding further diagnostic tests to achieve a final diagnosis. FDG-PET/CT should become a routine procedure in the workup of FUO when diagnostic clues are absent. FDG-PET/CT appears to be a cost-effective routine imaging technique in FUO by avoiding unnecessary investigations and reducing the duration of hospitalization.

"Abstract ObjectiveThe overall research objective was to theoretically and empirically develop the ideas around a system of safety management practices (ten practices were elaborated), to test their relationship with objective safety statistics (such as accident rates), and to explore how these practices work to achieve positive safety results (accident prevention) through worker engagement.MethodData were collected using safety manager, supervisor and employee surveys designed to assess and link safety management system practices, employee perceptions resulting from existing practices, and safety performance outcomes.Results Results  indicate the following: there is a significant negative relationship between the presence of ten individual safety management practices, as well as the composite of these practices, with accident rates; there is a significant negative relationship between the level of safety-focused worker emotional and cognitive engagement with accident rates; safety management systems and worker engagement levels can be used individually to predict accident rates; safety management systems can be used to predict worker engagement levels; and worker engagement levels act as mediators between the safety management system and safety performance outcomes (such as accident rates).ImplicationsEven though the presence of safety management system practices is linked with incident reduction and may represent a necessary first-step in accident prevention, safety performance may also depend on mediation by safety-focused cognitive and emotional engagement by workers. Thus, when organizations invest in a safety management system approach to reducing/preventing accidents and improving safety performance, they should also be concerned about winning over the minds and hearts of their workers through human performance-based safety management systems designed to promote and enhance worker engagement.

"Abstract The earlier recommendations of the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE) for the treatment of human echinococcosis have had considerable impact in different settings worldwide, but the last major revision was published more than 10 years ago. Advances in classification and treatment of echinococcosis prompted experts from different continents to review the current literature, discuss recent achievements and provide a consensus on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Among the recognized species, two are of medical importance –Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis – causing cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), respectively.For CE, consensus has been obtained on an image-based, stage-specific approach, which is helpful for choosing one of the following options: (1) percutaneous treatment, (2) surgery, (3) anti-infective drug treatment or (4) watch and wait. Clinical decision-making depends also on setting-specific aspects. The usage of an imaging-based classification system is highly recommended.For AE, early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis with albendazole remains one of the key elements. However, most patients with AE are diagnosed at a later stage, when radical surgery (distance of larval to liver tissue of >2 cm) cannot be achieved. The backbone of AE treatment remains the continuous medical treatment with albendazole, and if necessary, individualized interventional measures. With this approach, the prognosis can be improved for the majority of patients with AE.The consensus of experts under the aegis of the WHO-IWGE will help promote studies that provide missing evidence to be included in the next update.

"Abstract In this review article the authors presented up to-date development on the application of adsorption in the removal of dyes from aqueous solution. This review article provides extensive literature information about dyes, its classification and toxicity, various treatment methods, and dye adsorption characteristics by various adsorbents. One of the objectives of this review article is to organise the scattered available information on various aspects on a wide range of potentially effective adsorbents in the removal of dyes. Therefore, an extensive list of various adsorbents such as natural materials, waste materials from industry, agricultural by-products, and biomass based activated carbon in the removal of various dyes has been compiled here. Dye bearing waste treatment by adsorption using low cost alternative adsorbent is a demanding area as it has double benefits i.e. water treatment and waste management. Further, activated carbon from biomass has the advantage of offering an effected low cost replacement for non-renewable coal based granular activated carbon provided that they have similar or better adsorption on efficiency. The effectiveness of various adsorbents under different physico-chemical process parameters and their comparative adsorption capacity towards dye adsorption has also been presented. This review paper also includes the affective adsorption factors of dye such as solution pH, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The applicability of various adsorption kinetic models and isotherm models for dye removal by wide range of adsorbents is also reported here. Conclusions  have been drawn from the literature reviewed and few suggestions for future research are proposed.

"Abstract Whereas the motivational aspects of pay are well-documented, the notion that high pay leads to high levels of satisfaction is not without debate. The current study used meta-analysis to estimate the population correlation between pay level and measures of pay and job satisfaction. Cumulating across 115 correlations from 92 independent samples, results suggested that pay level was correlated .15 with job satisfaction and .23 with pay satisfaction. Various moderators of the relationship were investigated. Despite the popular theorizing, results suggest that pay level is only marginally related to satisfaction.

"Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator, was the first oral disease-modifying therapy approved for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis; it reduces autoreactive lymphocytes’ egress from lymphoid tissues by down-regulating S1PRs. Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling is implicated in a range of physiologic functions, and S1PRs are expressed differentially in various tissues, including the cardiovascular system. Modulation of S1PRs on cardiac cells provides an explanation for the transient effects of fingolimod on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction at initiation of fingolimod therapy, and for the mild but more persistent effects on blood pressure observed in some patients on long-term treatment. This review describes the nontherapeutic actions of fingolimod in the context of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the cardiovascular system, as well as providing a summary of the associated clinical implications useful to physicians considering initiation of fingolimod therapy in patients. A transient reduction in heart rate (mean decrease of 8 beats per minute) and, less commonly, a temporary delay in atrioventricular conduction observed in some patients when initiating fingolimod therapy are both due to activation of S1PR subtype 1 on cardiac myocytes. These effects are a reflection of fingolimod first acting as a full S1PR agonist and thereafter functioning as an S1PR antagonist after down-regulation of S1PR subtype 1 at the cell surface. For most individuals, first-dose effects of fingolimod are asymptomatic, but all patients need to be monitored for at least 6 hours after the first dose, in accordance with the label recommendations.

"BackgroundThe efficacy of vaginal progesterone for preventing preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a short cervix has been questioned after publication of the OPPTIMUM study.ObjectiveTo determine whether vaginal progesterone prevents preterm birth and improves perinatal outcomes in asymptomatic women with a singleton gestation and a midtrimester sonographic short cervix.Study DesignWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL (from their inception to September 2017); Cochrane databases; bibliographies; and conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials comparing vaginal progesterone vs placebo/no treatment in women with a singleton gestation and a midtrimester sonographic cervical length ≤25 mm. This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data. The primary outcome was preterm birth <33 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes included adverse perinatal outcomes and neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 2 years of age. Individual patient data were analyzed using a 2-stage approach. Pooled relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology.Results Data were available from 974 women (498 allocated to vaginal progesterone, 476 allocated to placebo) with a cervical length ≤25 mm participating in 5 high-quality trials. Vaginal progesterone was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth <33 weeks of gestation (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.81; P = .0006; high-quality evidence). Moreover, vaginal progesterone significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <36, <35, <34, <32, <30, and <28 weeks of gestation; spontaneous preterm birth <33 and <34 weeks of gestation; respiratory distress syndrome; composite neonatal morbidity and mortality; birthweight <1500 and <2500 g; and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (relative risks from 0.47-0.82; high-quality evidence for all). There were 7 (1.4%) neonatal deaths in the vaginal progesterone group and 15 (3.2%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.18–1.07; P = .07; low-quality evidence). Maternal adverse events, congenital anomalies, and adverse neurodevelopmental and health outcomes at 2 years of age did not differ between groups.ConclusionVaginal progesterone decreases the risk of preterm birth and improves perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with a midtrimester sonographic short cervix, without any demonstrable deleterious effects on childhood neurodevelopment.

"PurposeTo compare patient and Medicare savings from the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in guiding therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) to the research investments made in developing OCT by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).DesignObservational cohort study.Methods Main outcome measures were spending by Medicare as tracked by Current Procedural Terminology codes on intravitreal injections (67028), retinal OCT imaging (92134), and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment–specific J-codes (J0178, J2778, J9035, J3490, and J3590). These claims were identified from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services among fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries from 2012 to 2015; 2008 claims were acquired from the 100% FFS Part B Medicare Claims File. OCT research costs were determined by searching for grants awarded by NIH and NSF from inception to 2015. All costs and savings were discounted by 3% annually and adjusted for inflation to 2015 dollars.Results From 2008 to 2015, the United States government and nvAMD patients have accrued an estimated savings of $9.0 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, from the use of OCT to guide personalized anti-VEGF treatment. The $9.0 billion represents a 21-fold return on government investment into developing the technology through NIH and NSF grants.Conclusions Although an overall cost-benefit ratio of government-sponsored research is difficult to estimate because the benefit may be diffuse and delayed, the investment in OCT over 2 decades has been recouped many times over in just a few years through better personalized therapy.

"Abstract Experimentally selected single-stranded DNA and RNA aptamers are able to bind to specific target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Many analytical methods make use of affinity binding between the specific targets and their aptamers. In the development of these methods, thrombin is the most frequently used target molecule to demonstrate the proof-of-principle. This paper critically reviews more than one hundred assays that are based on aptamer binding to thrombin. This review focuses on homogeneous binding assays, electrochemical aptasensors, and affinity separation techniques. The emphasis of this review is placed on understanding the principles and unique features of the assays.

"Abstract IntroductionThe hypoglossal nerve (HN) may be damaged during neck surgeries. A detailed understanding of the anatomy of the hypoglossal nerve in relation to various anatomical landmarks and surrounding structures is important to reduce procedural complications and the risk of nerve damage.Methods The study was carried out using 21 sagittal sections of head and neck of male cadavers (16 right and 5 left). To measure the required parameters the anatomical landmarks taken were the posterior belly of digastric muscle (PBD), descendens hypoglossi of ansa cervicalis (AC), bifurcation of common carotid artery (CCA), tip of the mastoid process (TMP), lingual artery (LA) at the posterior border of hyoglossus muscle, tip of greater cornu of hyoid bone (GH), bifurcation of CCA to the attachment of descendens hypoglossi (CCA-AC).Results The length of PBD was 3.77 ± 1.08 cm on right side and 3.15 ± 0.05 cm on left side. The extended length was measured from the TMP to GH which was 6.7 ± 1.23 cm on right side and 6.75 ± 0.75 on left side. The distance between HN to the GH did not vary much between right and left sides which were 1.21 ± 0.35 and 1.2 ± 0.69 cm respectively. The distance between HN and LA at the posterior border of hyoglossus was 1.12 ± 0.3 cm on right side and 0.5 ± 0.3 cm on left side.DiscussionHN dissection is more complicated, as the location of the HN is much deeper. Moreover, there are no bony landmarks around the HN. Therefore PBD, CCA, ICA, ECA, LA were used as landmarks for HN in head and neck surgeries.

"Recent research has drawn attention to the link between lateral bias and cerebral functional asymmetry in animals. Most studies of animal laterality have focused on limb use arising from forced experimental challenges as opposed to spontaneous behaviours. This study explored, for the first time, the expression of lateralized spontaneous behaviour in the domestic cat, a species that exhibits motor bias in the form of paw preferences. The side used by 44 pet cats to perform three spontaneous behaviours (lying side, stepping down a flight of stairs, stepping over a raised object) was recorded. Paw preferences were also assessed using a more traditional forced food reaching challenge. Cats showed a significant lateral bias for food reaching, stepping down and stepping over. Those with a paw preference, however, did not differ significantly in their tendency towards left or right sidedness. The direction of the cats' side preferences was significantly correlated for most measures, whether forced or spontaneous. The strength of the cats' motor bias was significantly related to the task; animals displayed a weaker lateral bias for lying side than any other measure. The study revealed a sex split in the direction, although not the strength, of the cats' lateral bias for food reaching, stepping down and stepping over. Males showed a significant preference for using their left paw on these measures, while females were more inclined to use the right one. The study provides the first evidence that the domestic cat displays motor laterality on specific spontaneous behaviours, and that the direction, although not the strength, of these lateral biases is largely consistent with that of an experimental task. The results suggest that the more forced food-reaching test traditionally used to assess motor bias in the cat offers a biologically valid measure of limb use in this species.

"Abstract Greenery on buildings is being consolidated as an interesting way to improve the quality of life in urban environments. Among the benefits that are associated with greenery systems for buildings, such as energy savings, biodiversity support, and storm-water control, there is also noise attenuation. Despite the fact that green walls are one of the most promising building greenery systems, few studies of their sound insulation potential have been conducted. In addition, there are different types of green walls; therefore, available data for this purpose are not only sparse but also scattered. To gather knowledge about the contribution of vertical greenery systems to noise reduction, especially a modular-based green wall, two different standardised laboratory tests were conducted. The main results were a weighted sound reduction index (Rw) of 15 dB and a weighted sound absorption coefficient (α) of 0.40. It could be concluded that green walls have significant potential as a sound insulation tool for buildings but that some design adjustments should be performed, such as improving the efficiency of sealing the joints between the modular pieces.

Subjects sat in (1) PSS without lumbar support and (2) PSS with lumbar support for 10 min, after a period of trunk loading. Spinal height was measured using a stadiometer.Results Mean spinal height increase during PSS without lumbar support was 2.94 ± 3.63 mm and with lumbar support 4.74 ± 3.07 mm.Conclusions Both PSS with and without lumbar support significantly increased spinal height after a period of trunk loading (p < 0.001).

"Abstract The solution and complexation chemistry of zinc ions is the basis for zinc biology. In living organisms, zinc is redox-inert and has only one valence state: Zn(II). Its coordination environment in proteins is limited by oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur donors from the side chains of a few amino acids. In an estimated 10% of all human proteins, zinc has a catalytic or structural function and remains bound during the lifetime of the protein. However, in other proteins zinc ions bind reversibly with dissociation and association rates commensurate with the requirements in regulation, transport, transfer, sensing, signalling, and storage. In contrast to the extensive knowledge about zinc proteins, the coordination chemistry of the “mobile” zinc ions in these processes, i.e. when not bound to proteins, is virtually unexplored and the mechanisms of ligand exchange are poorly understood. Knowledge of the biological inorganic chemistry of zinc ions is essential for understanding its cellular biology and for designing complexes that deliver zinc to proteins and chelating agents that remove zinc from proteins, for detecting zinc ion species by qualitative and quantitative analysis, and for proper planning and execution of experiments involving zinc ions and nanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnO). In most investigations, reference is made to zinc or Zn2+ without full appreciation of how biological zinc ions are buffered and how the d-block cation Zn2+ differs from s-block cations such as Ca2+ with regard to significantly higher affinity for ligands, preference for the donor atoms of ligands, and coordination dynamics. Zinc needs to be tightly controlled. The interaction with low molecular weight ligands such as water and inorganic and organic anions is highly relevant to its biology but in contrast to its coordination in proteins has not been discussed in the biochemical literature. From the discussion in this article, it is becoming evident that zinc ion speciation is important in zinc biochemistry and for biological recognition as a variety of low molecular weight zinc complexes have already been implicated in biological processes, e.g. with ATP, glutathione, citrate, ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, nicotianamine, or bacillithiol.

"Abstract ObjectiveTo assess consensual validity, interrater reliability, and criterion validity of the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale, a new functional outcome scale intended to capture the severity of oropharyngeal dysphagia, as represented by the degree of diet texture restriction recommended for the patient.DesignParticipants assigned International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale scores to 16 clinical cases. Consensual validity was measured against reference scores determined by an author reference panel. Interrater reliability was measured overall and across quartile subsets of the dataset. Criterion validity was evaluated versus Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores assigned by survey respondents to the same case scenarios. Feedback was requested regarding ease and likelihood of use.SettingWeb-based survey.ParticipantsRespondents (N=170) from 29 countries.InterventionsNot applicable.Main Outcome MeasuresConsensual validity (percent agreement and Kendall τ), criterion validity (Spearman rank correlation), and interrater reliability (Kendall concordance and intraclass coefficients).Results The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale showed strong consensual validity, criterion validity, and interrater reliability. Scenarios involving liquid-only diets, transition from nonoral feeding, or trial diet advances in therapy showed the poorest consensus, indicating a need for clear instructions on how to score these situations. The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale showed greater sensitivity than the FOIS to specific changes in diet. Most (>70%) respondents indicated enthusiasm for implementing the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale.Conclusions This initial validation study suggests that the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale has strong consensual and criterion validity and can be used reliably by clinicians to capture diet texture restriction and progression in people with dysphagia.

"Abstract Human–Robot Interaction challenges Artificial Intelligence in many regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments that were not originally designed for robots; a broad variety of situations with rich semantics to understand and interpret; physical interactions with humans that requires fine, low-latency yet socially acceptable control strategies; natural and multi-modal communication which mandates common-sense knowledge and the representation of possibly divergent mental models. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human.We identify first the needed individual and collaborative cognitive skills: geometric reasoning and situation assessment based on perspective-taking and affordance analysis; acquisition and representation of knowledge models for multiple agents (humans and robots, with their specificities); situated, natural and multi-modal dialogue; human-aware task planning; human–robot joint task achievement. The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human–robot interaction. Supported by experimental results, we eventually show how explicit knowledge management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human–robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot's deliberative system.

"Abstract Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue. Constrained model predictive control: Stability and optimality",AUTOMATICA
"The first wave of behavior therapy countered the excesses and scientific weakness of existing nonempirical clinical traditions through empirically studied first-order change efforts linked to behavioral principles targeting directly relevant clinical targets. The second wave was characterized by similar direct change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different direction. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory (RFT). RFT explains why cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function over form, and the construction of flexible and effective repertoires, among other features. They build on the first- and second-wave treatments, but seem to be carrying the behavior therapy tradition forward into new territory.

"Abstract Background and objectivesRepetitive negative thinking (RNT) is often associated with disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms. Disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms may deal a “second hit” to attentional control deficits. This study evaluated whether sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions are related to the top-down control of attention to negative stimuli in individuals with heightened repetitive negative thinking.Methods Fifty-two community adults with high levels of transdiagnostic RNT and varying habitual sleep durations and bedtimes participated in a hybrid free-viewing and directed attention task using pairs of emotionally-evocative and neutral images while eye-tracking data were collected. Self-report and clinician-administered interviews regarding sleep were also collected.Results Shorter habitual sleep duration was associated with more time looking at emotionally negative compared to neutral images during a free-viewing attention task and more difficulty disengaging attention from negative compared to neutral images during a directed attention task. In addition, longer sleep onset latencies were also associated with difficulty disengaging attention from negative stimuli. The relations between sleep and attention for positive images were not statistically significant.LimitationsA causal link between sleep and attentional control cannot be inferred from these cross-sectional data. The lack of a healthy control sample means that the relations between sleep disruption, attention, and emotional reactivity may not be unique to individuals with RNT.Conclusions These findings suggest that sleep disruption may be associated with a specific impact on cognitive resources that are necessary for the top-down inhibitory control of attention to emotionally negative information. Shorter sleep duration and longer sleep onset latency are related to difficulty disengaging attention from negative emotional images in individuals with elevated transdiagnostic repetitive negative thinking",JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY

"Abstract Multidrug resistance (MDR) refers to the capability of bacterial pathogens to withstand lethal doses of structurally diverse drugs which are capable of eradicating non-resistant strains. MDR has been identified as a major threat to the public health of human being by the World Health Organization (WHO). Among the four general mechanisms that cause antibiotic resistance including target alteration, drug inactivation, decreased permeability and increased efflux, drug extrusion by the multidrug efflux pumps serves as an important mechanism of MDR. Efflux pumps not only can expel a broad range of antibiotics owing to their poly-substrate specificity, but also drive the acquisition of additional resistance mechanisms by lowering intracellular antibiotic concentration and promoting mutation accumulation. Over-expression of multidrug efflux pumps have been increasingly found to be associated with clinically relevant drug resistance. On the other hand, accumulating evidence has suggested that efflux pumps also have physiological functions in bacteria and their expression is subject tight regulation in response to various of environmental and physiological signals. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of drug extrusion, and regulation and physiological functions of efflux pumps is essential for the development of anti-resistance interventions. In this review, we summarize the development of these research areas in the recent decades and present the pharmacological exploitation of efflux pump inhibitors as a promising anti-drug resistance intervention.

"Abstract There is a critical need for new mechanism-of-action drugs that reduce the burden of obesity and associated chronic metabolic comorbidities. A potentially novel target to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes is nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT), a cytosolic enzyme with newly identified roles in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis. To validate NNMT as an anti-obesity drug target, we investigated the permeability, selectivity, mechanistic, and physiological properties of a series of small molecule NNMT inhibitors. Membrane permeability of NNMT inhibitors was characterized using parallel artificial membrane permeability and Caco-2 cell assays. Selectivity was tested against structurally-related methyltransferases and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) salvage pathway enzymes. Effects of NNMT inhibitors on lipogenesis and intracellular levels of metabolites, including NNMT reaction product 1-methylnicotianamide (1-MNA) were evaluated in cultured adipocytes. Effects of a potent NNMT inhibitor on obesity measures and plasma lipid were assessed in diet-induced obese mice fed a high-fat diet. Methylquinolinium scaffolds with primary amine substitutions displayed high permeability from passive and active transport across membranes. Importantly, methylquinolinium analogues displayed high selectivity, not inhibiting related SAM-dependent methyltransferases or enzymes in the NAD+ salvage pathway. NNMT inhibitors reduced intracellular 1-MNA, increased intracellular NAD+ and S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-methionine (SAM), and suppressed lipogenesis in adipocytes. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice systemically with a potent NNMT inhibitor significantly reduced body weight and white adipose mass, decreased adipocyte size, and lowered plasma total cholesterol levels. Notably, administration of NNMT inhibitors did not impact total food intake nor produce any observable adverse effects. These results support development of small molecule NNMT inhibitors as therapeutics to reverse diet-induced obesity and validate NNMT as a viable target to treat obesity and related metabolic conditions. Increased flux of key cellular energy regulators, including NAD+ and SAM, may potentially define the therapeutic mechanism-of-action of NNMT inhibitors.

"Abstract The continuous decline in Earth’s biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline.

All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) – defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material – is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results  from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.

"Abstract The dopamine hypothesis is the longest standing pathoetiologic theory of schizophrenia. Because it was initially based on indirect evidence and findings in patients with established schizophrenia, it was unclear what role dopamine played in the onset of the disorder. However, recent studies in people at risk of schizophrenia have found elevated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and increased dopamine release to stress. Furthermore, striatal dopamine changes have been linked to altered cortical function during cognitive tasks, in line with preclinical evidence that a circuit involving cortical projections to the striatum and midbrain may underlie the striatal dopamine changes. Other studies have shown that a number of environmental risk factors for schizophrenia, such as social isolation and childhood trauma, also affect presynaptic dopaminergic function. Advances in preclinical work and genetics have begun to unravel the molecular architecture linking dopamine, psychosis, and psychosocial stress. Included among the many genes associated with risk of schizophrenia are the gene encoding the dopamine D2 receptor and those involved in the upstream regulation of dopaminergic synthesis, through glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic pathways. A number of these pathways are also linked to the stress response. We review these new lines of evidence and present a model of how genes and environmental factors may sensitize the dopamine system so that it is vulnerable to acute stress, leading to progressive dysregulation and the onset of psychosis. Finally, we consider the implications for rational drug development, in particular regionally selective dopaminergic modulation, and the potential of genetic factors to stratify patients.

"Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that have anti-diabetic properties show very promising effects in animal models of AD. Glucagon (Gcg) is a hormone and growth-factor, and the Gcg receptor is expressed in the brain. Here we test the effects of a triple receptor agonist (TA), which activates GIP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors at the same time. In the present study, the effects of the TA were evaluated in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. The TA was injected once-daily (10 nmol/kg i.p.) for two months. The results showed that treatment with TA significantly reversed the memory deficit in the APP/PS1 mice in a spatial water maze test. Moreover, the drug reduced levels of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX, increased the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule Bcl-2 and enhanced the levels of BDNF, a key growth factor that protects synaptic function. Levels of synaptophysin were enhanced, demonstrating protection from synaptic loss that is observed in AD. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was furthermore enhanced as shown in the increase of doublecortin positive cells. Furthermore, TA treatment reduced the total amount of β-amyloid, reduced neuroinflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes), and oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these findings show that novel TAs are a promising lead for the design of future treatment strategies in AD.

"Abstract A methodology to determine the constitutive parameters for the simulation of progressive delamination is proposed. The procedure accounts for the size of a cohesive finite element and the length of the cohesive zone to ensure the correct dissipation of energy. In addition, a closed-form expression for estimating the minimum penalty stiffness necessary for the constitutive equation of a cohesive finite element is presented. It is shown that the resulting constitutive law allows the use of coarser finite element meshes than is usually admissible, which renders the analysis of large-scale progressive delamination problems computationally tractable.

"Abstract In this paper all the phases for the realization of the early warning system for the rockslide of Torgiovannetto in Central Italy are described. The landslide consists in a 182,000 m3 rock wedge threatening two roads which are important for local transportation. The present work encompasses all the components of an early warning system, including the geological knowledge, the risk scenarios, the kinematic characterization of the landslide, the choice and installation of the monitoring system, the setting of appropriate alarm levels and the definition of plans of civil protection. The focus is on practical and logistical issues met in all these phases and the counter-measures adopted.At present the system consists in 13 wire extensometers, 1 thermometer, 1 rain gauge and 3 cameras. Should a velocity threshold be exceeded by two or more sensors, the attention level would be entered, causing improved monitoring and surveillance. In case the behavior of the landslide changes and, by using expert judgment and forecasting methods, an imminent failure is hinted, then an alarm is issued and the upper road is closed.This paper can provide ideas and solutions for a landslide early warning system that aims to be simple, flexible, versatile and with a low probability of giving false alarms.

"Abstract Repeated Wi-Fi studies show that Wi-Fi causes oxidative stress, sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG changes, apoptosis, cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload. Each of these effects are also caused by exposures to other microwave frequency EMFs, with each such effect being documented in from 10 to 16 reviews. Therefore, each of these seven EMF effects are established effects of Wi-Fi and of other microwave frequency EMFs. Each of these seven is also produced by downstream effects of the main action of such EMFs, voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation. While VGCC activation via EMF interaction with the VGCC voltage sensor seems to be the predominant mechanism of action of EMFs, other mechanisms appear to have minor roles. Minor roles include activation of other voltage-gated ion channels, calcium cyclotron resonance and the geomagnetic magnetoreception mechanism. Five properties of non-thermal EMF effects are discussed. These are that pulsed EMFs are, in most cases, more active than are non-pulsed EMFs; artificial EMFs are polarized and such polarized EMFs are much more active than non-polarized EMFs; dose-response curves are non-linear and non-monotone; EMF effects are often cumulative; and EMFs may impact young people more than adults. These general findings and data presented earlier on Wi-Fi effects were used to assess the Foster and Moulder (F&M) review of Wi-Fi. The F&M study claimed that there were seven important studies of Wi-Fi that each showed no effect. However, none of these were Wi-Fi studies, with each differing from genuine Wi-Fi in three distinct ways. F&M could, at most conclude that there was no statistically significant evidence of an effect. The tiny numbers studied in each of these seven F&M-linked studies show that each of them lack power to make any substantive conclusions. In conclusion, there are seven repeatedly found Wi-Fi effects which have also been shown to be caused by other similar EMF exposures. Each of the seven should be considered, therefore, as established effects of Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is an important threat to human health",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
"Abstract Squaring hourly demand and wind-solar production data for Germany and a number of neighbouring countries with the results of the EU's ESTORAGE project, this paper studies the limits of Germany's energy revolution in view of the volatility of wind and solar power. In addition to pumped storage, it considers double-structure buffering, demand management, Norwegian hydro-dam buffering and international diversification via grid expansion. If Germany operated in autarchy and tried to handle the volatility of wind-solar production without using stores while replacing all nuclear and fossil fuel in power production, on average 61%, and at the margin 94%, of wind-solar production would have to be wasted, given the current level of other renewables. To avoid any waste, the wind-solar market share in an autarchic solution must not be expanded to more than 30%. By using Norway's hydro plants the share could be expanded to 36%. If Norway were to build all the pumped-storage plants the ESTORAGE study deems feasible, Germany's wind-solar market share could be expanded by another 24 percentage points to about 60%, which corresponds to 48% of the combined German and Norwegian markets. Additionally expanding the market to Switzerland, Austria and Denmark and building the maximal number of pumped stores would increase the combined wind-solar market share for all five countries to nearly 50%.

"Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is usually characterized by cardinal motor impairments. However, a range of non-motor symptoms precede the motor-phase and are major determinants for the quality of life. To date, no disease modifying treatment is available for PD patients. The gold standard therapy of levodopa is based on restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission, thereby alleviating motor symptoms, whereas non-motor symptoms remain undertreated. One of the most common non-motor symptoms is gastrointestinal dysfunction usually associated with alpha-synuclein accumulations and low-grade mucosal inflammation in the enteric nervous system. Accumulating evidence suggest that the enteric nervous system is involved in PD pathological progression towards the central nervous system. Moreover, different components of the gut could provide a central role in the gut-brain axis, which is as a bidirectional communicational system between the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Dietary components might influence the gut-brain axis by altering microbiota composition or by affecting neuronal functioning in both the ENS and the CNS. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the evidences supporting the hypothesis that PD could initiate in the gut. We also consider how food-based therapies might then have an impact on PD pathology and/or improve non-motor as well as motor symptoms in PD.

"Abstract DNA replication is a fundamental process of the cell that ensures accurate duplication of the genetic information and subsequent transfer to daughter cells. Various pertubations, originating from endogenous or exogenous sources, can interfere with proper progression and completion of the replication process, thus threatening genome integrity. Coordinated regulation of replication and the DNA damage response is therefore fundamental to counteract these challenges and ensure accurate synthesis of the genetic material under conditions of replication stress. In this review, we summarize the main sources of replication stress and the DNA damage signaling pathways that are activated in order to preserve genome integrity during DNA replication.

"Abstract Intravitreal administration is the method of choice in drug delivery to the retina and/or choroid. Rabbit is the most commonly used animal species in intravitreal pharmacokinetics, but it has been criticized as being a poor model of human eye. The critique is based on some anatomical differences, properties of the vitreous humor, and observed differences in drug concentrations in the anterior chamber after intravitreal injections. We have systematically analyzed all published information on intravitreal pharmacokinetics in the rabbit and human eye. The analysis revealed major problems in the design of the pharmacokinetic studies. In this review we provide advice for study design. Overall, the pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, volume of distribution, half-life) in the human and rabbit eye have good correlation and comparable absolute values. Therefore, reliable rabbit-to-man translation of intravitreal pharmacokinetics should be feasible. The relevant anatomical and physiological parameters in rabbit and man show only small differences. Furthermore, the claimed discrepancy between drug concentrations in the human and rabbit aqueous humor is not supported by the data analysis. Based on the available and properly conducted pharmacokinetic studies, the differences in the vitreous structure in rabbits and human patients do not lead to significant pharmacokinetic differences. This review is the first step towards inter-species translation of intravitreal pharmacokinetics. More information is still needed to dissect the roles of drug delivery systems, disease states, age and ocular manipulation on the intravitreal pharmacokinetics in rabbit and man. Anyway, the published data and the derived pharmacokinetic parameters indicate that the rabbit is a useful animal model in intravitreal pharmacokinetics.

"Abstract Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by pathophysiologic hallmark of length-dependent distal axonal degeneration of the corticospinal tracts. The prominent features of this pathological condition are progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. To date, 72 spastic gait disease-loci and 55 spastic paraplegia genes (SPGs) have been identified. All modes of inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked) have been described. Recently, a late onset spastic gait disorder with maternal trait of inheritance has been reported, as well as mutations in genes not yet classified as spastic gait disease. Several cellular processes are involved in its pathogenesis, such as membrane and axonal transport, endoplasmic reticulum membrane modeling and shaping, mitochondrial function, DNA repair, autophagy, and abnormalities in lipid metabolism and myelination processes. Moreover, recent evidences have been found about the impairment of endosome membrane trafficking in vesicle formation and about the involvement of oxidative stress and mtDNA polymorphisms in the onset of the disease. Interactome networks have been postulated by bioinformatics and biological analyses of spastic paraplegia genes, which would contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches.

"Abstract Despite the overall progress of sheep farming in Brazil, infections with the gastrointestinal parasite Haemonchus contortus represent one the most important problems in sheep production, aggravated by the increasing resistance of nematodes to traditional anthelmintic drugs caused by inadequate sheep flock management by breeders. Ethnopharmacological data indicate Annona muricata as a promising alternative for the control of gastrointestinal nematodes because of its general anthelmintic properties. The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro anthelmintic effects of A. muricata aqueous leaf extract against eggs, infective larvae and adult forms of parasitic nematode H. contortus. At higher doses, A. muricata extract showed 84.91% and 89.08% of efficacy in egg hatch test (EHT) and larval motility test (LMT), respectively. In the adult worm motility test, worms were completely immobilized within the first 6–8 h of nematode exposition to different dilutions of extract. Phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of phenolic compounds in A. muricata aqueous leaf extract that may be responsible for the anthelmintic effects observed. Moreover those results validate the traditional use of A. muricata as a natural anthelmintic and then the pharmacological potential of its compounds for future in vivo investigations.

"A significant proportion of human preimplantation embryos produced during the course of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments contain two or more cytogenetically distinct cell lines. This phenomenon, known as chromosomal mosaicism, can involve the presence of cells with different types of aneuploidy in the absence of any normal cells or a mixture of euploid and abnormal cells. Although a high prevalence of mosaicism at the cleavage and blastocyst stages has been appreciated for two decades, the precise frequency of the phenomenon and its consequences for embryo viability have been difficult to quantify. Recent advances in genetic technologies, such as high-resolution next-generation sequencing, have allowed mosaicism to be detected with much greater sensitivity than earlier methods. The application of these techniques to trophectoderm biopsies, taken from embryos before transfer to the uterus, has provided insight into the clinical impact of mosaicism. Data from recent studies show that blastocysts associated with mosaic trophectoderm biopsy specimens implant less often than embryos with a chromosomally normal biopsy. In addition, the mosaic embryos that succeed in establishing a pregnancy are at a significantly higher risk of miscarriage. Because mosaic embryos are less likely to produce a viable pregnancy than their euploid counterparts, we suggest that they are given a lower priority for transfer to the uterus. However, because these embryos can sometimes produce successful pregnancies, it is important that they can be considered for transfer in the absence of fully euploid embryos and after appropriate patient counseling. Unlike aneuploidy of meiotic origin, mosaicism, which is caused by mitotic errors occurring after fertilization, does not increase with advancing maternal age. There may, however, be clinical, treatment, or patient-related factors that contribute to the risk of mosaicism occurring. This review discusses the validation of methods that permit the detection of chromosomal mosaicism in IVF embryos and findings of clinical relevance.

"Abstract The pyrolysis characteristics of three main components (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) of biomass were investigated using, respectively, a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) detector and a pack bed. The releasing of main gas products from biomass pyrolysis in TGA was on-line measured using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In thermal analysis, the pyrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose occurred quickly, with the weight loss of hemicellulose mainly happened at 220–315 °C and that of cellulose at 315–400 °C. However, lignin was more difficult to decompose, as its weight loss happened in a wide temperature range (from 160 to 900 °C) and the generated solid residue was very high (∼40 wt.%). From the viewpoint of energy consumption in the course of pyrolysis, cellulose behaved differently from hemicellulose and lignin; the pyrolysis of the former was endothermic while that of the latter was exothermic. The main gas products from pyrolyzing the three components were similar, including CO2, CO, CH4 and some organics. The releasing behaviors of H2 and the total gas yield were measured using Micro-GC when pyrolyzing the three components in a packed bed. It was observed that hemicellulose had higher CO2 yield, cellulose generated higher CO yield, and lignin owned higher H2 and CH4 yield. A better understanding to the gas products releasing from biomass pyrolysis could be achieved based on this in-depth investigation on three main biomass components.

"Abstract Endocrinology is an indispensable tool in threatened species research. The study of endocrinology in threatened species not only advances knowledge of endocrine mechanism but also contributes to conservation efforts of studied species. To this end, endocrinology has been traditionally used to understand reproductive and adrenocortical endocrine axes by quantifying excreted steroid metabolites. From these studies a large body of knowledge was created that contributed to the field of endocrinology, aided conservation efforts, and created a template by which to validate and conduct this research for other species. In this regard noninvasive hormone monitoring has become a favored approach to study the basic endocrinology of wildlife species. Due to the increased understanding of endocrine physiology of threatened species, breeding rates of captive population have improved to levels allowing for reintroduction of species to restored natural ecosystems. Although these approaches are still employed, advances in biochemical, molecular, and genomic technologies are providing inroads to describe lesser known endocrine activity in threatened species. These new avenues of research will allow for growth of the field with greater depth and breadth. However, for all approaches to endocrinology, limitations on resources and access to animals will require innovation of current methodologies to permit broad application for use in threatened species research.

"Abstract Redeposited loess sediments from a Pleistocene crater filling in the Neuwied Basin (western Germany) yielded a small mammal fauna mainly composed of arvicoline rodents. The occurrence of rare faunal elements such as Sorex minutissimus, Sicista subtilis, and a species of Microtus (Terricola) is remarkable. Based on the evolutionary level of Arvicola terrestris, the biostratigraphic age of the fossiliferous horizon is transitional between late Eemian and early Weichselian. This conclusion is partly supported by the generalized ecological requirements of a few dominant rodent species. The fauna contributes to the knowledge of this time period, which is poorly documented in western Germany. A new character of the m1 is proposed for the discrimination of Sicista betulina and S. subtilis. To avoid further confusion in the specific assignment of transitional Arvicola specimens from the late Middle Pleistocene to early Late Pleistocene, we propose the formal taxonomic boundary between chronospecies A. mosbachensis and A. terrestris to be shifted from SDQ value 100 to SDQ value 120.

"Abstract The stone named “Hypatia” found in the Libyan Desert Glass area of southwest Egypt is carbon-dominated and rich in microdiamonds. Previous noble gas and nitrogen isotope studies suggest an extraterrestrial origin. We report on a reconnaissance study of the carbonaceous matrix of this stone and the phases enclosed in it. This focused on areas not affected by numerous transecting fractures mostly filled with secondary minerals. The work employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive (EDS) and wavelength-dispersive (WDS) electron microprobe (EMPA) analysis, Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) spectrometry and micro-Raman spectroscopy. We found that carbonaceous matrices of two types occur irregularly intermingled on the 50–500 μm scale: Matrix-1, consisting of almost pure carbonaceous matter, and Matrix-2, containing Fe, Ni, P and S at abundances analyzable by microprobe. Matrix-2 contains the following phases as inclusions: (i) (Fe,Ni) sulphide occurring in cloud-like concentrations of sub-μm grains, in domains of the matrix that are enriched in Fe and S. These domains have (Fe + Ni)/S (atomic) = 1.51 ± 0.24 and Ni/Fe = 0.086 ± 0.061 (both 1SD); (ii) grains up to ∼5 μm in size of moissanite (SiC); (iii) Ni-phosphide compound grains up to 60 μm across that appear cryptocrystalline or amorphous and have (Ni + Fe)/P (atomic) = 5.6. ± 1.7 and Ni/Fe = 74 ± 29 (both 1SD), where both these ratios are much higher than any known Ni-phosphide minerals; (iv) rare grains (observed only once) of graphite, metallic Al, Fe and Ag, and a phase consisting of Ag, P and I. In Matrix-2, Raman spectroscopy shows a prominent narrow diamond band at 1340 cm−1. In Matrix-1 the D and G bands of disordered carbon are dominant, but a minor diamond band is ubiquitous, accounting for the uniform hardness of the material. The D and G bands have average full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 295 ± 19 and 115 ± 19 cm−1, respectively, and the D/G intensity ratio is 0.75 ± 0.09 (both 1SD). These values are similar to those of the most primitive solar system carbonaceous matter. The diamond phase is considered to be a product of shock. The (Fe, Ni) sulphide phase is probably pyrrhotite and a shock origin is likewise proposed for it. Moissanite is frequently associated with the Ni-phosphide phase, and a presolar origin for both is suggested. The lack of recrystallization of the Ni-phosphide phase suggests that the Hypatia stone did not experience long-lasting thermal metamorphism, in accord with the Raman D-G band characteristics.A lack of silicate matter sets the stone apart from interplanetary dust particles and known cometary material. This, along with the dual intermingled matrices internal to it, could indicate a high degree of heterogeneity in the early solar nebula.

"Abstract The ‘4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate’ was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 %) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England & Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30 t C ha− 1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3 m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3 Gt C year− 1, which effectively offset 20–35% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers. Soil carbon 4 per mille",GEODERMA
"Abstract Recent attention has been drawn to possible linkages between poor sanitation in sub-Saharan African schools and low attendance rates amongst post-pubescent girls. In particular, questions have been raised about the influence of menstruation and access to sanitary products on schoolgirl absenteeism but research on this topic is scarce. Moreover, the few detailed empirical studies that have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on this topic have produced contradictory results. These uncertainties coupled with theories of how concepts of pollution and taboo are used to construct or police spatial boundaries (and maintain power relations within society) provide an interesting context for examining everyday geographies of menstruation. Kisumu, Kenya provides the context for the study which utilises a feminist political ecology framework to investigate cultural and spatial limitations associated with menstruation and puberty. Drawing on schoolgirls’ lived experiences, we illustrate how emotional geographies of puberty and menstruation are productive of and help to reproduce gender inequalities in mobility and access to social capital resources (especially education). At the same time we show how poverty coupled with low levels of sexual and reproductive health and rights education can exacerbate gendered bodily inequalities as girls face an increased risk of sexual exploitation when they reach puberty. It’s a girl thing: Menstruation, school attendance, spatial mobility and wider gender inequalities in Kenya",GEOFORUM
"Abstract We describe late Miocene tetrapod footprints (tracks) from the Trachilos locality in western Crete (Greece), which show hominin-like characteristics. They occur in an emergent horizon within an otherwise marginal marine succession of Messinian age (latest Miocene), dated to approximately 5.7 Ma (million years), just prior to the Messinian Salinity Crisis. The tracks indicate that the trackmaker lacked claws, and was bipedal, plantigrade, pentadactyl and strongly entaxonic. The impression of the large and non-divergent first digit (hallux) has a narrow neck and bulbous asymmetrical distal pad. The lateral digit impressions become progressively smaller so that the digital region as a whole is strongly asymmetrical. A large, rounded ball impression is associated with the hallux. Morphometric analysis shows the footprints to have outlines that are distinct from modern non-hominin primates and resemble those of hominins. The interpretation of these footprints is potentially controversial. The print morphology suggests that the trackmaker was a basal member of the clade Hominini, but as Crete is some distance outside the known geographical range of pre-Pleistocene hominins we must also entertain the possibility that they represent a hitherto unknown late Miocene primate that convergently evolved human-like foot anatomy.

"Abstract Forced convective heat transfer from smooth, solid and isothermal spheres of various diameters has been studied experimentally in air flows with various free-stream velocities. The average heat transfer coefficient has been determined from the steady measured power input to a heating element inside the spheres and the steady measured temperatures of the flowing air and of the surface of the spheres, employing corrections to account for heat transfer due to thermal radiation and due to natural convection. The current data for the average heat transfer coefficient, expressed as a relationship between the Nusselt number and the Reynolds number, complement data in literature with respect to the range of large Reynolds numbers that have been considered: here the Reynolds numbers were between 7.8×103 and 3.3×105. The experimental results show a sudden increase in the Nusselt number above a critical Reynolds number of approximately 2.9×105, analogous to the “drag crisis” for the drag force on the sphere. A correlation for the Nusselt number as a function of the Reynolds number has been formulated for air flows that describes these data well for Reynolds numbers below the critical Reynolds number.

"Abstract This article is part of a Special Issue “Parental Care”. Pregnancy and postpartum are associated with dramatic alterations in steroid and peptide hormones which alter the mothers' hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axes. Dysregulations in these endocrine axes are related to mood disorders and as such it should not come as a major surprise that pregnancy and the postpartum period can have profound effects on maternal mood. Indeed, pregnancy and postpartum are associated with an increased risk for developing depressive symptoms in women. Postpartum depression affects approximately 10–15% of women and impairs mother–infant interactions that in turn are important for child development. Maternal attachment, sensitivity and parenting style are essential for a healthy maturation of an infant's social, cognitive and behavioral skills and depressed mothers often display less attachment, sensitivity and more harsh or disrupted parenting behaviors, which may contribute to reports of adverse child outcomes in children of depressed mothers. Here we review, in honor of the “father of motherhood”, Jay Rosenblatt, the literature on postnatal depression in the mother and its effect on mother–infant interactions. We will cover clinical and pre-clinical findings highlighting putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying postpartum depression and how they relate to maternal behaviors and infant outcome. We also review animal models that investigate the neurobiology of maternal mood and disrupted maternal care. In particular, we discuss the implications of endogenous and exogenous manipulations of glucocorticoids on maternal care and mood. Lastly we discuss interventions during gestation and postpartum that may improve maternal symptoms and behavior and thus may alter developmental outcome of the offspring.

"Abstract Adaptive control methods are developed for stability and tracking control of flight systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties. This paper offers a design technique of adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) for finite-time stabilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with parametric uncertainties. Applying the Lyapunov stability concept and finite-time convergence idea, the recommended control method guarantees that the states of the quad-rotor UAV are converged to the origin with a finite-time convergence rate. Furthermore, an adaptive-tuning scheme is advised to guesstimate the unknown parameters of the quad-rotor UAV at any moment. Finally, simulation results are presented to exhibit the helpfulness of the offered technique compared to the previous methods.

"Abstract Ultraviolet radiation is known to inhibit photosynthesis, induce DNA destruction and cause damage to a wide variety of proteins and lipids. In particular, UV radiation between 200 and 300 nm becomes energetically very damaging to most of the terrestrial biological systems. On the other hand, UV radiation is usually considered one of the most important energy source on the primitive Earth for the synthesis of many biochemical compounds and, therefore, essential for several biogenesis processes. In this work, we use these properties of the UV radiation to define the boundaries of an ultraviolet habitable zone. We also analyze the evolution of the UV habitable zone during the main sequence stage of the star. We apply these criteria to study the UV habitable zone for those extrasolar planetary systems that were observed by the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE). We analyze the possibility that extrasolar planets and moons could be suitable for life, according to the UV constrains presented in this work and other accepted criteria of habitability (liquid water, orbital stability, etc.).

"Abstract Previous research has established the benefits of branding for business-to-business (B2B) organizations. Various tools can be used to support B2B brands, including the internet and other interactive technologies. Yet research on how organizations use Social Networking Sites (SNS) to achieve brand objectives remains limited. This study addresses the gap by focusing on B2B SMEs and their social networking practices, particularly, usage, perceived barriers, and the measurement of effectiveness of SNS as a marketing tool. Findings from a mail survey show that over a quarter of B2B SMEs in the UK are currently using SNS to achieve brand objectives, the most popular of which is to attract new customers. On the other hand, the most significant barrier is the lack of perceived relevance for particular sectors. Notably, the overwhelming majority of users do not adopt any metrics to assess SNS effectiveness. Almost half of the sample of SMEs that currently use SNS have indicated their intention to increase their marketing spending on this channel, highlighting the growing importance of SNS in a B2B context.

"Abstract Consider n mobile sensors placed independently at random with the uniform distribution on a barrier represented as the unit line segment [0,1]. The sensors have identical sensing radius, say r. When a sensor is displaced on the line a distance equal to d it consumes energy (in movement) which is proportional to some (fixed) power a>0 of the distance d traveled. The energy consumption of a system of n sensors thus displaced is defined as the sum of the energy consumptions for the displacement of the individual sensors.We focus on the problem of energy efficient displacement of the sensors so that in their final placement the sensor system ensures coverage of the barrier and the energy consumed for the displacement of the sensors to these final positions is minimized in expectation. In particular, we analyze the problem of displacing the sensors from their initial positions so as to attain coverage of the unit interval and derive trade-offs for this displacement as a function of the sensor range. We obtain several tight bounds in this setting thus generalizing several of the results of [10] to any power a>0.

"Abstract It is already true that Big Data has drawn huge attention from researchers in information sciences, policy and decision makers in governments and enterprises. As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore’s Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.

"Abstract Caution should be exercised when one is comparing the redox potentials of complexes measured in CH3CN solutions versus different reference electrodes. A critical review of conversion constants amongst various reference electrodes reported in the literature reveals that in most cases the comparisons of redox potential values are far from accurate. From measurements of relationships amongst various common reference electrodes in CH3CN solutions, conversion constants for redox potentials measured versus different reference electrodes in acetonitrile solutions at 25°C are proposed, along with a convention for reporting redox potential values.

"Abstract The trend towards ultra compact thermal power generation, is constrained by the unavailability of fluid-machinery adequate for supersonic flow conditions. Conventional turbine designs exhibit unacceptable performances related to large aerodynamic losses and a narrow operation range. This paper provides for the first time in the open literature the design procedure, and subsequent analysis of the turbine performance of a turbine adequate for supersonic axial pulsating flows, as those encountered in innovative combustors. The design approach considers the most adverse condition, a steady inlet axial Mach number equal to 3.5. The possible turbine families were classified by the velocity triangles and discussed. A fundamental issue in supersonic passages is to ensure the normal shock at the start of the engine is swallowed through the turbine passages, namely the turbine passage is started. To ensure self-starting capability the turning is restricted to lower values than in the conventional subsonic turbines. The design procedure was based on the method of characteristics, converting the inlet uniform flow into a vortex flow field, such that the adequate deflection is inflicted to the supersonic flow. The performance of the supersonic passage was first assessed and then compared to conventional designs. The present design procedure and analysis of unconventional supersonic turbines provides guidelines for the design and optimization of efficient high supersonic passages, suitable to future tightly packed fluid machinery.

"Abstract In this study, nonlinear analysis of ionic polymer–metal composite (IPMC) strips using the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory with the von Kármán nonlinear strain is presented. The governing equations are derived using a variational formulation based on a thermodynamic framework. The nonlinear extensions to the linear theory are made in such a way that the resulting form of the coupling between deformation and solvent concentration remains simple. A hybrid finite element–finite volume numerical solution and a operator-split time stepping scheme are formulated for obtaining numerical solutions of the transient electromechanical response. The model is phenomenological, but it is capable of simulating the transient response of IPMC strips under general loading conditions, and it would be useful in the design of mechanisms with IPMC strips as components. The results of the nonlinear analysis are compared with the corresponding linear results for a cantilever beam like IPMC strip. Significant differences in simulation results of tip deflection, solvent concentration, and beam configurations are observed between the linear and the nonlinear beam theory. The differences are due to coupling between the bending and the axial stiffness as properly formulated in the proposed nonlinear theory.

"Abstract BackgroundPerson-centred care has been identified as the ideal approach to caring for people with dementia. Developed in relation to long stay settings, there are challenges to its implementation in acute settings. However, international policy indicates that acute care for people with dementia should be informed by the principles of person-centred care and interventions should be designed to sustain their personhood.ObjectivesUsing Kitwood's five dimensions of personhood as an a priori framework, the aim of this paper was to explore the way in which current approaches to care in acute settings had the potential to enhance personhood in older adults with dementia.DesignData collected to explore the current experiences of people with dementia, family carers and co-patients (patients sharing the ward with people with mental health problems) during hospitalisation for acute illness were analysed using a dementia framework that described core elements of person centred care for people with dementia.SettingsRecruitment was from two major hospitals within the East Midlands region of the UK, focusing on patients who were admitted to general medical, health care for older people, and orthopaedic wards.ParticipantsParticipants were people aged over 70 on the identified acute wards, identified through a screeing process as having possible mental health problems. 34 patients and their relatives were recruited: this analysis focused on the 29 patients with cognitive impairment.MethodThe study involved 72 h of ward-based non-participant observations of care complemented by 30 formal interviews after discharge concerning the experiences of the 29 patients with cognitive impairment. Analysis used the five domains of Kitwood's model of personhood as an a priori framework: identity, inclusion, attachment, comfort and occupation.Results While there were examples of good practice, health care professionals in acute settings were not grasping all opportunities to sustain personhood for people with dementia.Conclusions There is a need for the concept of person-centred care to be valued at the level of both the individual and the organisation/team for people with dementia to have appropriate care in acute settings.

"Abstract Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for more than 95% of all human malaria infections, and thus pose a serious public health challenge. To control and potentially eliminate these pathogens, it is important to understand their origins and evolutionary history. Until recently, it was widely believed that P. falciparum had co-evolved with humans (and our ancestors) over millions of years, whilst P. vivax was assumed to have emerged in southeastern Asia following the cross-species transmission of a parasite from a macaque. However, the discovery of a multitude of Plasmodium spp. in chimpanzees and gorillas has refuted these theories and instead revealed that both P. falciparum and P. vivax evolved from parasites infecting wild-living African apes. It is now clear that P. falciparum resulted from a recent cross-species transmission of a parasite from a gorilla, whilst P. vivax emerged from an ancestral stock of parasites that infected chimpanzees, gorillas and humans in Africa, until the spread of the protective Duffy-negative mutation eliminated P. vivax from human populations there. Although many questions remain concerning the biology and zoonotic potential of the P. falciparum- and P. vivax-like parasites infecting apes, comparative genomics, coupled with functional parasite and vector studies, are likely to yield new insights into ape Plasmodium transmission and pathogenesis that are relevant to the treatment and prevention of human malaria.

"Abstract The stress–strain behaviour of extruded AA6xxx and AA7xxx aluminium alloys in T6 temper was studied at a wide range of strain rates. Tensile tests at low to medium strain rates were performed in a standard tensile test machine, while a split-Hopkinson tension bar was used to carry out tests at high rates of strain. Extruded aluminium alloys have anisotropic mechanical properties, and tests were therefore done in three directions with respect to the extrusion direction. It is found that the AA6xxx alloys exhibit no significant rate sensitivity in the stress–strain behaviour, while moderate rate sensitivity was found for the AA7xxx alloys. There seems to be no significant difference between the rate sensitivity in the three tensile directions. The experimental data were used to identify the parameters of a thermo-viscoplastic constitutive relation for the extruded alloys, which includes the effects of strain hardening, strain-rate hardening, thermal softening and plastic anisotropy.

"Abstract We study the regularity up to the boundary of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the fractional Laplacian. We prove that if u is a solution of (−Δ)su=g in Ω, u≡0 in Rn\Ω, for some s∈(0,1) and g∈L∞(Ω), then u is Cs(Rn) and u/δs|Ω is Cα up to the boundary ∂Ω for some α∈(0,1), where δ(x)=dist(x,∂Ω). For this, we develop a fractional analog of the Krylov boundary Harnack method.Moreover, under further regularity assumptions on g we obtain higher order Hölder estimates for u and u/δs. Namely, the Cβ norms of u and u/δs in the sets {x∈Ω:δ(x)⩾ρ} are controlled by Cρs−β and Cρα−β, respectively.These regularity results are crucial tools in our proof of the Pohozaev identity for the fractional Laplacian (Ros-Oton and Serra, 2012 [19,20]).

"Abstract Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are perceived to be safer than traditional tobacco cigarettes because of the absence of combustion processes. The use of these devices, however, exposes the users (“vapers”) and passive “vapers” to possible high concentration of fine and ultrafine particles (UFPs) which can deliver toxic and carcinogenic compounds. In the present work, an experimental campaign was carried out using dedicated instrumentation in order to characterize both the aerosol emitted from ECs and the exposure to second hand EC smoke in a typical indoor microenvironment in terms of particle number and surface area concentrations. Thus, the potential carcinogenic effects due to the inhalation of EC-generated aerosol was evaluated by means of an ad-hoc Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) model able to take into account for the contribution of both sub-micron and super-micron particles, referring to the particle surface area, evaluated on the basis of their solid core only, by heating the aerosol at 300 °C. To this end, literature data of toxic compounds deposited on EC-generated particles (both with and without nicotine) and typical smoking behaviours of male and female Italian vapers were considered. The results showed that the particle number concentrations in EC mainstream aerosol (2.23–2.34×108 part. cm−3, mode at 34 nm) are higher than that in mainstream smoke of traditional cigarettes, while surface area concentrations in mainstream EC aerosol (2.48–3.35×1010 nm2 cm−3, at 300 °C)) are lower than that in traditional mainstream cigarettes smoke. The corresponding ELCR value of mainstream EC aerosol (6.11–7.26×10−6) is 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of mainstream traditional cigarettes smoke, and also lower than the guideline values defined by EPA and WHO. Particle number concentrations equal to 6.30–9.08×103 part. cm−3 with bi-modal distribution (at 30 nm and 90 nm) and surface area concentrations of 5.16–5.90×107 nm2 cm−3 (at 300 °C), respectively, were measured in second-hand aerosol of ECs, leading to extremely low values of ELCR due to the exposure to second-hand EC aerosol (1.24–2.70×10−8).

"Abstract Background and aims Atherogenesis is dependent upon monocyte influx into the vessel wall. In humans, three monocyte subsets exist, the number and function of which are significantly altered in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether such alterations arise in individuals with a perturbed lipid profile remains largely unanswered, but is important to delineate, as adoption of a pro-inflammatory state may promote plaque formation. Here, we compared the inflammatory status of monocyte subsets and determined whether monocyte inflammatory changes are evident in individuals with a perturbed lipid profile.Methods Monocyte subset cytokine production, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory marker expression were determined by whole blood flow cytometry and related to participants' lipid levels.Results The intermediate and non-classical monocytes were more inflammatory than classicals as seen by their higher cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and M1 marker (CD86) expression, but lower levels of M2 markers (CD93, CD163). More importantly, a considerable variation was seen between participants, with all monocytes of one individual being more inflammatory than those of another. Many inter-individual differences were related to participants' lipid levels. IL-1β production correlated negatively with Apo A1 and HDL-C. CD86 and TLR2 correlated positively with Chol:HDL-C but negatively with HDL-C and Apo A1:Apo B. Interestingly, CD163 expression correlated positively with Chol:HDL-C but negatively with Apo A1:Apo B.Conclusions Our data indicates that priming of all monocytes to an inflammatory state occurs in individuals with a perturbed lipid profile, overriding the normal functional distinction attributed to the different monocyte subsets. As such, all monocytes may be important in CVD. Monocyte inflammatory profile is specific for individuals and associated with altered blood lipid levels",ATHEROSCLEROSIS
"Abstract Subject-specific musculoskeletal models require accurate values of muscle moment arms. The aim of this study was to compare moment arms of wrist tendons obtained from non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to those obtained from an in vitro experimental approach. MRI was performed on ten upper limb cadaveric specimens to obtain the centrelines for the flexor carpi radialis (FCR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), and abductor pollicis longus (APL) tendons. From these, the anatomical moment arms about each of the flexion-extension (FE) and radioulnar deviation (RUD) axes of the wrist were calculated. Specimens were mounted on a physiologic wrist simulator to obtain functional measurements of the moment arms using the tendon excursion method. No differences were observed between anatomical and functional values of the FE and RUD moment arms of FCR, ECRL and ECRB, and the RUD moment arm of ECU (p > .075). Scaling the anatomical moment arms relative to ECRB in FE and ECU in RUD reduced differences in the FE moment arm of FCU and the RUD moment arm of APL to less than 15% (p > .139). However, differences persisted in moment arms of FCU in RUD, and ECU and APL in FE (p < .008). This study shows that while measurements of moment arms of wrist tendons using imaging do not always conform to values obtained using in vitro experimental approaches, a stricter protocol could result in the acquisition of subject-specific moment arms to personalise musculoskeletal models.

"Abstract The direct hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol is crucial for providing a means of CO2 fixation and a way to store cleanly produced hydrogen in a more energy-dense and transportable form. Here we have prepared two series of Pd/ZnO catalysts, both by immobilisation of PVA-protected Pd colloids and by Pd impregnation of PdCl2 to investigate structure activity relationships for direct CO2 hydrogenation. Very different performances were found for the different preparation methods, and the Pd loading and pre-reduction of the catalysts were shown to be important factors for optimising methanol yield. The crucial factor for high methanol yield is the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy, either during the reaction itself, or better by high temperature pre-reduction. The formation of the alloy greatly reduces CO production by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalysts prepared by sol-immobilisation were relatively stable to thermal treatment. In contrast, the impregnated catalysts were much less thermally stable, due to the presence of remnant chloride on the surface of the catalyst, which was absent for the case of sol immobilisation preparation. The results illustrate the importance of controlling the PdZn particle size and its surface structure for the catalysts to achieve high methanol selectivity (60%, the rest being CO) and conversion (11%) at 250 °C and 20 bar. Selectivity for sol-immobilised catalysts decreases from 60% at 3 nm average diameter, to 20% at 7 nm. Pd/ZnO catalysts for direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol",JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS

The results confirmed that the treated E. coli cells were damaged, showing formation of “pits” in the cell wall of the bacteria, while the silver nanoparticles were found to accumulate in the bacterial membrane. A membrane with such a morphology exhibits a significant increase in permeability, resulting in death of the cell.

Results  showed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous social orienting and gestural communication for the experimental children, compared to six age- and behaviorally-matched control children with autism. In addition, for the children who received treatment, the duration of social dyadic interactions and total time spent engaged in social interaction increased from pre- to post-treatment.

"Abstract While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about “big data”, useful data is usually “small” and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schrödinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.

"Abstract The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing “ocean sprawl”. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

"Abstract Sociometer theory asserts that self-esteem is calibrated to one's perceived relational value. Accordingly, positive feedback should boost self-esteem because it signals acceptance by others. Yet, the extent to which self-esteem is sensitive to positive feedback may depend on individuals' sense of purpose. In two studies (N = 342), we tested purpose in life as a source of self-directed and prosocial motivation and predicted that having greater purpose would lessen sensitivity to social media feedback. Study 1 revealed that the number of likes individuals received on their Facebook profile pictures was positively associated with self-esteem. Study 2 replicated these findings experimentally by manipulating the number of likes individuals received on self-photographs posted to a mock Facebook site. In both studies, links between likes and self-esteem were diminished for those with greater purpose. Implications for purpose as a moderator of the self-esteem contingencies of positive social feedback are discussed.

The fluorination installation consists of a glove box kept under a purified argon atmosphere, a high temperature horizontal fluorination reactor and a HF supply gas line connected to the glove box. The fluorides were synthesised from high specific surface oxides prepared from the respective oxalates by low temperature calcination. The fluorination was partly stationary and partly in a HF gas flow, based on a heterogeneous powder-gas reaction at high temperatures. The products were characterised by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, which confirmed high purity products obtained by this method. Moreover, the melting point of UF4 was revised using a pure sample and a new value is suggested.

"Abstract We provide an alternative proof to those by Shkarin and by Bayart and Matheron that the operator D of complex differentiation supports a hypercyclic algebra on the space of entire functions. In particular we obtain hypercyclic algebras for many convolution operators not induced by polynomials, such as cos(D), DeD, or eD−aI, where 0<a≤1. In contrast, weighted composition operators on function algebras of analytic functions on a plane domain fail to support supercyclic algebras.

"SummaryA combination of driving forces are increasing pressure on local, national, and regional water supplies needed for irrigation, energy production, industrial uses, domestic purposes, and the environment. In many parts of Europe groundwater quantity, and in particular quality, have come under sever degradation and water levels have decreased resulting in negative environmental impacts. Rapid improvements in the economy of the eastern European block of countries and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. In this research we build and calibrate an integrated hydrological model of Europe using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals. Leaching of nitrate into groundwater is also simulated at a finer spatial level (HRU). The use of large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation. In this article we discuss issues with data availability, calibration of large-scale distributed models, and outline procedures for model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability and quality. The approach and methods developed are general and can be applied to any large region around the world.

"Abstract Background/objectivesCurrent measures of cytokines involve urine, blood or saliva which have drawbacks including circadian rhythm variations and complicated collection methods. Sweat has been used to measure cytokines in young and middle-aged adults, but not older adults. We sought to determine the feasibility of using sweat to measure cytokines in older adults compared to younger adults.DesignTwo visit cross-sectional pilot study stratified by age group.SettingIndependent living facility and Johns Hopkins University both in Maryland.Participants23 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older and 26 adults aged 18–40 were included. Those with active cancer treatment or with a known terminal illness diagnosis were excluded.MeasurementsSweat interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were collected using a non-invasive sweat patch worn for 72 h by each participant. Samples were measured with a single molecule array (SIMOA) technology for ultrasensitive, multiplexed detection of proteins.Results 23 older adults and 26 younger adults with mean ages of 77 ± 8.0 years and 28 ± 5.5 years, respectively, completed the study. Both groups had high rates of compliance with patch wearing and removal. Higher concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in older adults compared to younger adults, which remained significant after controlling for race, sex, body mass index, and chronic disease count (0.110 ± 0.030 vs. 0.054 ± 0.020 pg/mL, 0.089 ± 0.012 vs. 0.048 ± 0.018 pg/mL, and 0.124 ± 0.029 vs. 0.067 ± 0.025 pg/mL, respectively).ConclusionThese results suggest that sweat patches are a feasible method to collect cytokine data from older adults. Preliminary group differences in cytokine measurement between older and younger groups correspond with current literature that cytokines increase with age, suggesting that sweat measurement using the sweat patch provides a new method of exploring the impact of inflammation on aging. Further research using sweat and the sweat patch is recommended. Using sweat to measure cytokines in older adults compared to younger adults: A pilot study",JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS
"Abstract Critical thermal limits provide an indication of the range of temperatures across which organisms may survive, and the extent of the lability of these limits offers insights into the likely impacts of changing thermal environments on such survival. However, investigations of these limits may be affected by the circumstances under which trials are undertaken. Only a few studies have examined these effects, and typically not for beetles. This group has also not been considered in the context of the time courses of acclimation and its reversal, both of which are important for estimating the responses of species to transient temperature changes. Here we therefore examine the effects of rate of temperature change on critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and minima (CTmin), as well as the time course of the acclimation response and its reversal in two beetle species, Tenebrio molitor and Cyrtobagous salviniae. Increasing rates of temperature change had opposite effects on T. molitor and C. salviniae. In T. molitor, faster rates of change reduced both CTmax (c. 2 °C) and CTmin (c. 3 °C), while in C. salviniae faster rates of change increased both CTmax (c. 6 °C) and CTmin (c. 4 °C). CTmax in T. molitor showed little response to acclimation, while the response to acclimation of CTmin was most pronounced following exposure to 35 °C (from 25 °C) and was complete within 24 h. The time course of acclimation of CTmax in C. salviniae was 2 days when exposed to 36 °C (from c. 26 °C), while that of CTmin was less than 3 days when exposed to 18 °C. In T. molitor, the time course of reacclimation to 25 °C after treatments at 15 °C and 35 °C at 75% RH was longer than the time course of acclimation, and varied from 3–6 days for CTmax and 6 days for CTmin. In C. salviniae, little change in CTmax and CTmin (<0.5 °C) took place in all treatments suggesting that reacclimation may only occur after the 7 day period used in this study. These results indicate that both T. molitor and C. salviniae may be restricted in their ability to respond to transient temperature changes at short-time scales, and instead may have to rely on behavioral adjustments to avoid deleterious effects at high temperatures.

"Abstract We test the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth in a cross-country regression framework, utilizing data on FDI flows from industrial countries to 69 developing countries over the last two decades. Our results suggest that FDI is an important vehicle for the transfer of technology, contributing relatively more to growth than domestic investment. However, the higher productivity of FDI holds only when the host country has a minimum threshold stock of human capital. Thus, FDI contributes to economic growth only when a sufficient absorptive capability of the advanced technologies is available in the host economy. How does foreign direct investment affect economic growth?1We are grateful for comments from Robert Barro, Elhanan Helpman, Boyan Jovanovic, Mohsin Khan, Se-Jik Kim, Donald Mathieson, Sergio Rebelo, Jeffrey Sachs, Peter Wickham, and two anonymous referees.

"Abstract The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 15 years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance.Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets.A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i.e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins.Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy.Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control.

"Abstract A rhodamine B semicarbazide 3 was synthesized by the reaction of rhodamine B acid chloride 2 with hydrazine carboxamide hydrochloride under reflux with triethyl amine in acetonitrile. It was used as selective fluorescent and colorimetric sensor for visual detection of Cu2+ over competitive ions (Fe3+,Fe2+, Cr3+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Ag2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, Cs2+, Na+, K+, Li+) in aqueous methanol (1:1, v/v), exhibiting a fast response time, less than few second and a detection limit of 1.6×10−7 mol/L at neutral pH. The proposed sensing system can be successfully applicable for determination of Cu2+ in waste water samples showing turn on fluorescence response and for further monitoring of intracellular Cu2+ levels in living cells with high sensitivity and selectivity at micro molar level concentrations using confocal fluorescence spectroscopy.

"Abstract The utility of anthracycline antineoplastic agents in the clinic is compromised by the risk of cardiotoxicity. It has been calculated that approximately 10% of patients treated with doxorubicin or its derivatives will develop cardiac complications up to 10 years after the cessation of chemotherapy. Oxidative stress has been established as the primary cause of cardiotoxicity. However, interventions reducing oxidative stress have not been successful at reducing the incidence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with doxorubicin. New insights into the cardiomyocyte response to oxidative stress demonstrate that underlying differences between in vitro and in vivo toxicities may modulate the response to superoxide radicals and related compounds. This has led to potentially new uses for pre-existing drugs and new avenues of exploration to find better pharmacotherapies and interventions for the prevention of cardiotoxicity. However, much work still must be done to validate the clinical utility of these new approaches and proposed mechanisms. In this review, the authors have reviewed the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of acute and chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and propose potential pharmacological interventions and treatment options to prevent or reverse this specific type of heart failure.

"Abstract The polyamines (PAs) spermidine, spermine, putrescine and cadaverine are an essential class of metabolites found throughout all kingdoms of life. In this comprehensive review, we discuss their metabolism, their various intracellular functions and their unusual and conserved regulatory features. These include the regulation of translation via upstream open reading frames, the over-reading of stop codons via ribosomal frameshifting, the existence of an antizyme and an antizyme inhibitor, ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation, a complex bi-directional membrane transport system and a unique posttranslational modification—hypusination—that is believed to occur on a single protein only (eIF-5A). Many of these features are broadly conserved indicating that PA metabolism is both concentration critical and evolutionary ancient. When PA metabolism is disrupted, a plethora of cellular processes are affected, including transcription, translation, gene expression regulation, autophagy and stress resistance. As a result, the role of PAs has been associated with cell growth, aging, memory performance, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders and cancer. Despite comprehensive studies addressing PAs, a unifying concept to interpret their molecular role is missing. The precise biochemical function of polyamines is thus one of the remaining mysteries of molecular cell biology.

"Abstract We present here the first experimental study of the microwave spectrum of deuterated 5-methyltropolone, a molecule which exhibits two large-amplitude motions: an intramolecular hydrogen transfer (deuterium transfer in the current case of deuterated 5-methyltropolone) and a methyl torsion. The main goal of this study was to get information on the isotopic dependence of the main tunneling parameters of 5-methyltropolone in the framework of the two dimensional tunneling formalism, which previously has shown some counterintuitive results for isotopic dependence of tunneling parameters in 2-methylmalonaldehyde. Measurements were carried out by Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy in the 9 GHz to 26 GHz frequency range. Theoretical analysis was carried out using a tunneling-rotational Hamiltonian based on a G12m extended-group-theory formalism. Our global fit of 384 transitions to 17 molecular parameters gave a weighted root-mean-square deviation of 0.8. The current study on the isotopic dependence of the main tunneling parameters in 5-methyltropolone supports the assumption of possible “leakage” between tunneling parameters in the two-dimensional tunneling formalism in use.

"Abstract MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) is a powerful technique to quantify biomolecular interactions. It is based on thermophoresis, the directed movement of molecules in a temperature gradient, which strongly depends on a variety of molecular properties such as size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. Thus, this technique is highly sensitive to virtually any change in molecular properties, allowing for a precise quantification of molecular events independent of the size or nature of the investigated specimen.During a MST experiment, a temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser. The directed movement of molecules through the temperature gradient is detected and quantified using either covalently attached or intrinsic fluorophores. By combining the precision of fluorescence detection with the variability and sensitivity of thermophoresis, MST provides a flexible, robust and fast way to dissect molecular interactions.In this review, we present recent progress and developments in MST technology and focus on MST applications beyond standard biomolecular interaction studies. By using different model systems, we introduce alternative MST applications – such as determination of binding stoichiometries and binding modes, analysis of protein unfolding, thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics. In addition, wedemonstrate the capability of MST to quantify high-affinity interactions with dissociation constants (Kds) in the low picomolar (pM) range as well as protein–protein interactions in pure mammalian cell lysates.

"Abstract The objective of this communication is to clarify the meanings of solid and liquid, to dwell on the ultimate fate of glass in the limit of infinitely long time, and to propose a modern, improved definition of glass. We review the four characteristic states of matter related to vitrification: the stable equilibrium liquid (L), the metastable supercooled liquid (SCL), the unstable nonequilibrium glass (G), and the stable crystal (C). We also discuss some relevant terms and phenomena, including glass transition, crystallization, non-crystalline, amorphous, solid, and frozen. We review several previously published definitions of glass and finally propose an improved definition in two alternative forms. The first improved definition is: “Glass is a nonequilibrium, non-crystalline state of matter that appears solid on a short time scale but continuously relaxes towards the liquid state.” This is an intuitive description for the general public and young students. An alternative, more detailed definition to be understood and used by advanced students, researchers, and professors is: “Glass is a nonequilibrium, non-crystalline condensed state of matter that exhibits a glass transition. The structure of glasses is similar to that of their parent supercooled liquids (SCL), and they spontaneously relax toward the SCL state. Their ultimate fate, in the limit of infinite time, is to crystallize.” This definition is for experts who understand the meaning of glass transition.

"Abstract Organometallic complexes containing ligands such as CO, carbenes, alkyls, phenyls, π-bound alkynes, alkenes, cyclopentadienyls and arenes possess properties which have often been exploited in areas such as catalysis and materials chemistry. They also offer opportunities for the design of new drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Here we focus on anticancer drugs which might complement successful platinum drugs in the clinic by widening the spectrum of activity, reducing side-effects and combatting resistance. The early clinical trials of titanocene dichloride highlighted the need to understand the aqueous solution chemistry of organometallic complexes and to identify their target sites in cancer cells. More recently organometallic Cp complexes of Fe(II), Rh(III) and Ir(III), and arene complexes of Ru(II) and Os(II), have been shown to target the redox balance in cancer cells, in contrast to DNA which is the target of cisplatin and related platinum drugs. The activity of both catalytic and photoactive organometallic compounds is being explored. Target recognition and activity are highly dependent not only on the metal and its oxidation state, but also the other coordinated ligands, the coordination number and geometry. In general, organometallic complexes are ‘pro-drugs’ which undergo activation in vivo (by ligand exchange or redox reactions), and the ligands themselves may be active components of the drug. A major challenge is to elucidate the chemistry of organometallic complexes directly in cells. The design of organometallic complexes for therapeutic and diagnostic applications in cancer and other areas of medicine present new and exciting research opportunities.

"Abstract Statement of problemThe number of partially dentate adults is increasing, and many patients will require replacement of missing teeth. Although current treatment options also include fixed partial dentures and implants, removable partial dentures (RPDs) can have advantages and are widely used in clinical practice. However, a significant need exists to advance materials and fabrication technologies because of the unwanted health consequences associated with current RPDs.PurposeThe purpose of this review was to assess the current state of and future need for prosthetics such as RPDs for patients with partial edentulism, highlight areas of weakness, and outline possible solutions to issues that affect patient satisfaction and the use of RPDs.Material and methodsThe data on treatment for partial edentulism were reviewed and summarized with a focus on currently available and future RPD designs, materials, means of production, and impact on oral health. Data on patient satisfaction and compliance with RPD treatment were also reviewed to assess patient-centered care.Results Design, materials, ease of repair, patient education, and follow-up for RPD treatment all had a significant impact on treatment success. Almost 40% of patients no longer use their RPD within 5 years because of factors such as sociodemographics, pain, and esthetics. Research on RPD-based treatment for partial edentulism for both disease-oriented and patient-centered outcomes is lacking.Conclusions Future trials should evaluate new RPD materials and design technologies and include both long-term follow-up and health-related and patient-reported outcomes.

"Abstract The human gut harbors a dynamic and complex microbial ecosystem, consisting of approximately 1 kg of bacteria in the average adult, approximately the weight of the human brain. The evolutionary formation of a complex gut microbiota in mammals has played an important role in enabling brain development and perhaps sophisticated social interaction. Genes within the human gut microbiota, termed the microbiome, significantly outnumber human genes in the body, and are capable of producing a myriad of neuroactive compounds. Gut microbes are part of the unconscious system regulating behavior. Recent investigations indicate that these microbes majorly impact on cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns, such as social interaction and stress management. In the absence of microbes, underlying neurochemistry is profoundly altered. Studies of gut microbes may play an important role in advancing understanding of disorders of cognitive functioning and social interaction, such as autism.

"Abstract ObjectiveMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR.Methods Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis.Results Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P<.0001) with homogeneity of distribution.ConclusionAlthough derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.
